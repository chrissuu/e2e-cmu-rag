Emerging Visions
This multi-site urban gallery exhibition created in collaboration with Silver Eye Center for Photography features the works from emerging Pittsburgh artists, transforming vacant storefronts in Downtown into an outdoor art experience.
Various works by Evangeline Mensah-Agyekum529 Liberty AvenueAs a self-taught artist, Mensah-Agyekum primarily works with photography, fashion, and film. Evangeline draws inspiration from the banalities of daily life and the Black experience to explore Blackness, womanhood, and the unique intersections of identity. Much of her work aims to capture individuals, in part by transforming them, portraying undaunted characters through their vulnerability.
Legacy (2018) by Anqwenique Kinsel604 Liberty AvenueAnqwenique is a versatile artist and educator known for her talents in opera, classical, jazz, and soul music. As the founder and director of Groove Aesthetic, she delves into contemporary performance and collaborative processes. Legacy pays tribute to the legendary Leontyne Price, the first African American operatic soprano to achieve international recognition.
Stay Awhile (2023) by Sobia Ahmad817 Liberty AvenueAhmad’s ongoing body of work centers on Pando, an ancient aspen tree grove in south-central Utah, believed to be over 10,000 years old. Unified by a single immense root system, Pando stands as the earth’s oldest and heaviest living organism, embodying interconnectedness and oneness. Ahmad’s art explores the transcendental power of everyday experiences, objects, and practices through various slow and contemplative processes.
“Send My Love to the Hill”Artworks by Charlese Dawson and poem by Jhordan Price421 Seventh AvenueThis photobook of poetry takes audiences on a tour through the Hill District through the lens of people who are a part of the community. Send My Love to The Hill is a love letter to this historic black community that has nurtured both Dawson’s artistry and humanity. Appropriately, this installation is only yards away from the August Wilson African American Cultural Center whose esteemed namesake described life in The Hill over decades and generations.

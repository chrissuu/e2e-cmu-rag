Downtown Development Activities Meetings
The Downtown Development Activities Meetings (DAM) is a forum available for residents, business owners, property owners, and other stakeholders to learn more about proposed Downtown development projects and provide feedback before the project can move forward in the City’s planning and approval process.
ANNOUNCEMENT: August 1, 2025 – Beginning with the next regularly scheduled Development Activities Meeting on September 11, 2025 at 5:30 PM, the public meeting format and project registration process Downtown Development Activities Meetings will change.
PDP welcomes the Downtown Neighbors Alliance (DNA) as co-hosts of the Development Activities Meetings.
In this new co-hosting format, the City of Pittsburgh Department of City Planning (DCP) has graciously offered to facilitate the agenda and host the meetings on the DCP zoom account.
If you are subscribed to receive our email notifications, we will continue sending those out 10 days in advance of each meeting.
They will include a flyer (provided to us by DCP) with the agenda items for the meeting and the virtual meeting link.
As Registered Community Organization (RCO) for Downtown, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (PDP) will host public meetings to review upcoming projects in Downtown before they are reviewed by applicable City of Pittsburgh commissions and boards, allowing your feedback to be heard early in the planning process. View a map of the PDP’s RCO boundary here.
All meetings will take place at least thirty (30) days prior to the applicant’s first public hearing.
Upcoming Meetings
There are no agenda items for the regularly scheduled meeting on October 9, so the next DAM is scheduled for Thursday, November 13 at 5:30 PM via Zoom. Meeting info will be posted here at least 10 days prior.

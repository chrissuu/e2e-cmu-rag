Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror

EVENT WEBSITE
Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror is a joyful and wild ride through the tale of the cultural juggernaut that is The Rocky Horror Picture Show. From its humble origins as a London fringe theater play, the documentary tracks its meteoric rise, fall and resurrection to become the biggest cult film of all time. With intimate access to its creator Richard O’Brien and other major players such as Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon and Lou Adler, the documentary explores what makes the play and film so singular: Its groundbreaking and transgressive themes, iconic performances and epic songs that took over popular culture. The cult phenomenon that sprung around it is unparalleled, and created not only the midnight screenings which continue to this day, but also a safe haven for those who ever felt different or marginalized – with particular significance for the queer community. In our current political climate, Rocky Horror’s message of inclusion and self expression holds more resonance than ever. As Dr. Frank-N-Furter says, “Don’t Dream It, Be It.”

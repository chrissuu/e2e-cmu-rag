More about Erik:
The art of silhouettes was highly popular in America from 1790 to 1840. However, once the camera was invented, the era of silhouettes came to an end as a form of portraiture. Now it is a rare art form prized by a new generation who appreciate the nostalgic appeal it conveys. Erik Johnson is a third generation silhouette artist, who began learning the art of silhouettes at the age of 10 from his father, Edward M. Johnson. In fact, the Johnson family have been creating silhouettes for more than six decades, traveling the world creating wonderful heirloom keepsakes. Erik travels all over the world creating these one of a kind, hand cut silhouettes in less than 5 minutes. He specializes in children’s boutiques, toy stores, weddings, and parties. He has cut thousands of silhouettes for satisfied customers worldwide. Erik makes his home in the beautiful Queen City of Charlotte, NC. Erik has 5 children.

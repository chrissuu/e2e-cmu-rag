One Day to Remember is proud to announce the return of One Bite One Day, Pittsburgh’s most delicious night out and a premier foodie event with a powerful purpose. The celebration takes place on Thursday, October 23, 2025, at the Pittsburgh Opera and will bring together more than 25 of the city’s top chefs and bartenders for an unforgettable evening of food, drinks, and connection.
Guests will enjoy a wide variety of dishes and craft cocktails, along with live entertainment, interactive experiences, and a silent auction filled with unique items. An exclusive VIP hour offers early access, open bar, and valet parking for an elevated experience.
This year’s emcee is Ki Ki B. Jones, a proud Pittsburgh native and media personality with more than 25 years of radio experience. From her early days at WAMO to her current role as lead on-air host at WAMO 107.3, Ki Ki has built her career around amplifying voices, sharing stories, and connecting communities. Her deep roots in the city and her passion for uplifting others make her the perfect host to guide this special evening.
Beyond the food and entertainment, One Bite One Day carries a mission that reaches far beyond the event itself. All proceeds benefit One Day to Remember, a nonprofit organization that creates customized outings for families where a parent is living with advanced-stage cancer. These days are thoughtfully designed to help families step away from treatment and medical challenges, giving them a chance to reconnect, laugh, and create lasting memories together.
Each family day is uniquely tailored — whether it is a trip to the zoo, an amusement park adventure, a sporting event, or a cozy at-home movie night complete with dinner and games. Every family also receives a professional photo shoot and keepsake photo album so the memories can be cherished for years to come.
Chef Neil Blazin of Driftwood Oven and board member of One Day to Remember shared why the event matters so deeply:“Food has always been my way to connect with friends, family, and strangers. Sharing a meal with other people serves as a way to help form community and strengthen bonds. When Rachel asked me to participate in her One Bite One Day event, I knew it would be an incredible way to connect with folks who really needed some nourishment for not only their bodies, but their spirits as well. One Day to Remember helps strengthen family bonds, fosters community around these families, and brings joy to those who have been given a bleak diagnosis. I’m grateful to be involved and enjoy helping in any way that I can.”
Since its founding, One Day to Remember has reached a milestone of 500 family outings. This accomplishment is a testament to the Pittsburgh community that continues to rally around the mission and to the power of creating one unforgettable day.
“Pittsburgh shows up big for this night, and for the families we serve,” said Rachel Antin, Founder and Executive Director of One Day to Remember. “This isn’t just a fundraiser. It’s a chance to turn food, celebration, and generosity into memories that last a lifetime. Every guest who attends helps give a child one more day to laugh with their parent, one more moment to hold onto forever.”
One Bite One Day is more than a night of great food and fun. It is a community coming together to ensure that families facing the hardest of challenges are given the gift of joy, togetherness, and love.

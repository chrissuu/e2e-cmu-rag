Theater
An irreverent, darkly comic, modern take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous sleuth and sidekick, this fast-paced romp reexamines the world’s most famous detective story with a bold new feminist lens. In this highly theatrical, small-cast escapade, oddball female roommates Sherlock (yes, it’s also a girl’s name—wait, is it a girl’s name? Is it even a name?) Holmes & Joan Watson join forces to emerge from pandemic fog as a deeply codependent, quasi-dysfunctional Odd Couple adventure duo—solving mysteries and kicking butts, until they come face to face with a villain who seems to have all of the answers.

Enron isn’t just a play — it’s a high-octane look into the glittering freefall of American capitalism. A surprising and exhilarating dramatization of the real-life financial scandal, Enron uses political satire, dazzling multimedia, innovative staging, and more to transport audiences back to the sexy 1990s. Staged above the city in the retro-cool Oxford Centre, this production offers a wild ride with characters you’ll remember from corporate infamy: Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow, and that Southern charmer Ken Lay.

This three-play cycle is a modern retelling of the fall of the House of Atreus. It follows the children of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, siblings who are both players in the family tragedy and victims of it. The cycle of blood and vengeance seems inescapable until the final reunion of a lost sister and brother brings the bloody family saga to its mystical and unlikely end.

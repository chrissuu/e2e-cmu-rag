Real-Time Bike Lane Data
Do you want to find out how many people actually use the Penn Avenue Bike Lane? We’ve installed bike counters at three locations along Penn Avenue to monitor Bike Lane usage.
Note: the Downtown Bike Lane counters are removed and not tracking from November through late March in order to mitigate excessive wear from snow removal.

2022 Downtown Resident Survey
The PDP conducts a resident survey every two years to gather the feedback and opinions of residents in Greater Downtown (consisting of the Golden Triangle, North Shore, Uptown, and Strip District). The data obtained from this survey is used by the PDP to inform decision-making within the public and private sectors as well as to guide PDP programming and initiatives. The 2022 Downtown Resident Survey is the seventh resident survey that has been conducted since the PDP began data tracking in 2008.

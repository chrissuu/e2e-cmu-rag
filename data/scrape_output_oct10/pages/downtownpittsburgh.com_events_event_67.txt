EVENT WEBSITE
Cancer Bridges’ annual Light Up Gala is a beacon of hope and support for all those whose lives have been impacted by cancer. This inspiring evening brings together more than 325 advocates, supporters, and community leaders to celebrate resilience, honor luminaries whose leadership and generosity have shaped Cancer Bridges and cancer support in our region, and pay tribute to the journeys of survivors, caregivers, and those we remember.
Throughout the evening, we present the Light Up Hope, Light Up Pittsburgh, Light Up Cancer Bridges, and Light Up Community Awards, honoring individuals and organizations whose impact has been instrumental in advancing our mission and uplifting the cancer community.
The Gala features an engaging cocktail hour, elegant dinner, silent auctions, and heartfelt storytelling. As Cancer Bridges’ largest fundraising event, the Light Up Gala raises critical funds to provide free emotional, social, and health and wellness programs for anyone navigating cancer—from diagnosis through treatment and into life beyond.
Thank you for joining us for this unforgettable evening.

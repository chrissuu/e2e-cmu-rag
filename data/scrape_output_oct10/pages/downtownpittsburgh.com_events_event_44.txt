CrossBody is excited to offer this unique training opportunity for the Fall semester!
For those of you who dance “just for fun” and are still reading this… hear us out. Even if you have ZERO interest in competing or performing, this will help take your social dancing to the next level.
Those who train to compete REQUIRE proper technique. Basic step, weight transfer, foot placement, frame, timing, musicality… the list goes on. In our own years of training and competing, we also realized our social dance skills skyrocketed by training these techniques. It makes you more agile, smooth, and connected in your dance. If you’ve wondered how to get that “WOW” factor with your SOCIAL dancing… this is it!
If you’ve ever been interested in the world of Latin dance competition, they will be teaching the fundamentals, techniques, and skills necessary to succeed. They will be taking our years of experience in the world of Latin dance competition to bring you the most comprehensive salsa and bachata dance training offered in Pittsburgh to date.

Grand Rapids, MI-based indie rock band The Crane Wives (1.4m Spotify monthly listeners, 713.5k TikTok likes) are ready to charm live audiences once again, heading back out on the road this fall after a summer of shows supporting their newest album Beyond Beyond Beyond, out everywhere now. Due to overwhelming demand, the band has announced a new string of dates taking place through November, traveling across the midwest to the northeast coast and stopping by cities like Pittsburgh, Ithaca, Richmond, Baltimore, Boston, and beyond.
Born of the 2010’s folk boom and now comfortably stationed in their rock and roll era, The Crane Wives epitomize the evolving landscape of indie folk. Their high-energy performances have been described as “charged with emotion and technical skill” (Blurred Culture), while their harmony-dense melodies support deeply resonant lyrics, exploring the vulnerable and the ugly sides of the human condition. The band has built a global community and has amassed over 1m Spotify monthly listeners and 100m+ total streams with their unparalleled, spirited live show, evocative lyricism and glimmering harmonies.
Featured by Michigan Radio and NPR’s “All Songs Considered," the band recently released their sixth full-length studio record, Beyond Beyond Beyond, to high praise, with Glasse Factory calling the album “a testament to the band’s ability to turn personal struggles into universally
relatable anthems." Niner Times describes the new release as “angsty, haunting and gritty,” praising its departure from the more traditional folk sound of The Crane Wives’ previous records. Since its release in September 2024, Beyond Beyond Beyond has accrued over 18 million streams on Spotify.

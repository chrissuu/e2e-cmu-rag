Construction Updates
Road closures can be painful, but we’re helping to ease the struggles of ongoing construction. We’re providing navigation tips to help you get to and from Downtown effortlessly.

Pittsburgh Regional Transit Detours
For transit riders, staying up to date with Pittsburgh Regional Transit’s detour information is crucial for getting around seamlessly. PRT provides up-to-date detour information for their bus, rail, stations, and park-n-ride facilities.

HOV Lanes
The High Occupancy Vehicle (HOVs) lanes on I-279 (Parkway North) and I-579 (Crosstown Boulevard) are open to all outbound traffic on Fridays and the weekends after 7 p.m. and remain open until 5 a.m. on Mondays. In addition, the two-passenger vehicle rule does not apply during weekend hours.
To alleviate congestion and bypass construction, motorists are encouraged to use the HOV lanes to exit the City of Pittsburgh following games and other events Downtown on weekends.

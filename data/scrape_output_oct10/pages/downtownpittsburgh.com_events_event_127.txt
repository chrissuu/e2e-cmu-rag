On Sunday, Oct. 26, the museum will transform into a Halloween wonderland packed with family-friendly festivities.
The sweetest treat of all – kids ages 17 and under always receive FREE admission to the History Center, supported by the Kamin “Free for Kids” Initiative.
Little ghouls, goblins, and ghosts can embark on a haunted scavenger hunt that leads them to trick-or-treat stations across all six floors of exhibitions. While collecting candy and clues, families can explore the Scary Pittsburgh section of Pittsburgh’s Hidden History and cross paths with costumed spirits roaming the galleries. Afterwards, kids can create their own creepy mask inspired by the exhibit.
At 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., gather for Spooky Storytime with folklorist Thomas White, who will share eerie tales and legends from Pittsburgh’s past. Perfect for kids ages 6 to 12, these sessions will bring local folklore to life in a fun, not-too-scary way.
Throughout the program, families can also enjoy nonstop Halloween activities. Kids can show off their monster side with freaky face painting and temporary tattoos, strike a pose in the photo booth to capture the day’s memories, and collect a free, special edition orange pickle pin!
Plus, don’t forget to step outside for a chillingly fun sip from The Coffin Bean & Co., a mobile coffee bar pulled by a hearse that will be serving themed drinks.

Patient Care
Through his own battle with cancer, Mario Lemieux learned how fragile life can be. He also came to recognize the resources that patients and their families need to navigate a cancer journey. Consequently, through the Foundation, Mario has forged a life-long commitment to offering hope and support to cancer patients who need it most. The Foundation’s ongoing Patient-care initiatives exemplify how channeling adversity into philanthropy can be a win-win.

Austin's Playrooms
What would you do if you had three children: two healthy kids and one in the hospital with a threatening medical condition? That’s the experience the Lemieux family had when their son, Austin, was born premature in 1996. At that time, they had two toddlers and newborn Austin, who would spend 71 days in the NICU. Following their experience, Mario and Nathalie recognized the need to help other families who face challenging situations in medical facilities, and the idea for Austin’s Playrooms was born.

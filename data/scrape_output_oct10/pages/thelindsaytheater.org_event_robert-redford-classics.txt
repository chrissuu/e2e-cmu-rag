Robert Redford Classics
October 6
–
October 16
The Lindsay is celebrating a Hollywood legend by showing three of his most important films.
Robert Redford passed away last month at age 89. Among his many accomplishments, Redford starred in Best Picture winners The Sting and Out of Africa; directed Best Picture winner Ordinary People; appeared in a variety of beloved films, from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to All the President’s Men; co-founded the Sundance Institute and Sundance Film Festival; and received a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.
To celebrate his incomparable legacy, The Lindsay will play three Redford classics multiple times between Monday, Oct. 6 and Thursday, Oct. 16. Here are quick primers on The Sting, The Way We Were and Out of Africa:
The Sting
PG | 2h 9min | Crime, Drama, Comedy
Director: George Roy Hill
Stars: Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Robert Shaw
The Sting reunites the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid trio of director George Roy Hill and stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Redford plays con man Johnny Hooker, who is out for revenge against mobster Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) for murdering his best friend. He and master con artist Henry Gondorff (Newman) construct an elaborate ruse to take Lonnegan for all he’s worth.
“The Sting is pure gold, the kind of movie that dreams of sophisticated entertainment are made on,” declares New York Magazine. The film’s central con “makes for some of the funniest, most outrageous, suspenseful and surprising moments” in cinema history, raves the Los Angeles Times.
“It’s a triumph of quality Hollywood craftsmanship. … The Sting overflows with warmth and nostalgia. Newman, Redford and Shaw are in top form.”

The Way We Were
PG | 1h 58min | Romance, Drama
Director: Sydney Pollack
Star: Robert Redford, Barbara Streisand, Bradford Dillman
The Way We Were is one of seven collaborations between Redford and director Syndey Pollack. It stars Barbara Streisand as Katie Morosky, a politically active young woman who strikes up a relationship with Hubbell Gardiner (Redford). Despite their differences, they marry and desperately try to keep their love alive.
This searing romantic drama “stays afloat because of the chemistry between Barbara Streisand and Robert Redford,” praises The New Yorker.
Pollack’s film, featuring Oscar-winning Marvin Hamlisch music, “says things that no one else has dared to say in a major Hollywood movie,” The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed in 1973. The always game Redford exudes “icy, dangerous charm.”

Out of Africa
PG | 1h 58min | Epic, Drama, Romance
Director: Sydney Pollack
Star: Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, Klaus Maria Brandauer
Out of Africa won seven Oscars at the 1986 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Based on the life and memoirs of Danish author Isak Dinesen, this epic drama set in early 19th-century Kenya follows the blossoming romance between a wealthy baroness (Meryl Streep) and rugged big-game hunter (Redford).
“Never has a country been more lovingly photographed” than Kenya in director Sydney Pollack’s “vibrant, lush movie,” applauds the New York Daily News. Pollack’s multi-Oscar winner is “an old-fashioned, intelligent, thoughtful love story,” Roger Ebert wrote in 1985.
“Out of Africa is a great movie to look at, breathtakingly filmed on location. It is a movie with the courage to be about complex, sweeping emotions, and to use the star power of its actors without apology.”

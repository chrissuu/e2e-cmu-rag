Community, Special, Exhibits
Discover our artist-in-residence, Ting Tong Chang's latest solo exhibition at Mattress Factory!
Chang was selected for exhibition by a panel of Mattress Factory alumni artists through the 2024 International Open Call.
Ting Tong Chang (b.1982, Taipei) is an artist who lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan and Santiago de Compostela, Spain and has exhibited internationally.
Chang’s satirical gaze leaves no aspect of society untouched. Reveling in the absurd and illogical, he makes a mockery of socio-political subjects ranging from the social and ecological effects of consumerism to the functioning of the art world itself.

Event Description
Utopia, Limited by Gilbert & Sullian, October 10-19, 2025, Music directed by Guy Ruso with stage direction by Robert Hockenberry.  This farce makes fun of limited liability companies and the notion of bankruptcy without penalty.  A group of upright English bureaucrats and officers discover an idyllic existence on the island of Utopia, where at the behest of Princess Zara, the English-educated daughter of King Paramount, are asked to bring Utopia's politics and morals into line with England's spotless standards.  The King and Zara go a bit overboard with making everyone a "company limited" and the Utopia Supreme Court, and ultimately the entire populace, revolt under the new rules that are creating job losses.  Zara realizes that under the two party system, each party will undo what the other has done and there will be confusion in the future in any case, and so peace is restored.

Pittsburgh Sound Preserve "Open Improv Lab"
Every other Monday, 8-11 p.m.
free
Open Stage, Jazz
We want to create a space for people from different backgrounds, with all different levels and types of musical training, to improvise together. This means we will navigate collective sound making while doing our best to let go of musical underlying assumptions and remain open to process. We can ask the questions: What does the sound want to be? What feels interesting to us? How can we have a positive conversation across traditions / cultures / backgrounds / levels of training?

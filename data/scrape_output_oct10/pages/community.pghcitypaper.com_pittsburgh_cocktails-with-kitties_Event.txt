Fri., Oct. 10, 5:30-7:30 p.m.
It's that time again! Kick off the weekend with Cocktails with Kitties! Trash Cat Rescue will be at Goodlander Cocktail Brewery from 5:30-7:30pm with adoptable cats to meet and Trash Cat merch for purchase! 10% of sales will be donated to Trash Cat to support the nearly 300 cats in our care, so make sure to try their delicious cocktails and mocktails (and maybe take a growler home?).

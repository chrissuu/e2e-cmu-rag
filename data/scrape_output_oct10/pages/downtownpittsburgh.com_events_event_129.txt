EVENT WEBSITE
Extending from the Monongahela River to Liberty Avenue, Grant Street is Downtown’s great civic thoroughfare, bringing to life Pittsburgh’s history through the street’s stellar architectural mix. On this one street, you will see the mark that Henry Clay Frick left through his real estate ventures and learn about the various avenues of authority through which Andrew W. Mellon made an impact on the cityscape. You will see the work of outstanding architects from Pittsburgh and beyond, and buildings ranging from a small stone church to the City’s tallest building. You will be wowed by an early-20th-century infrastructure project that literally changed the landscape. And you will discover how adaptive reuse of historic buildings in this corridor proves the value of historic preservation in sustaining the City’s heritage.
So whether history or architecture is your “thing,” join us for a walk along a remarkable street that the American Planning Association has dubbed one of the Great Places in America.
Tickets: $25
Meeting Location: Corner of Grant and Forbes Ave

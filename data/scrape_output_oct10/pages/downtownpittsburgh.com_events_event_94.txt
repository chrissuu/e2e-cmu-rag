EVENT WEBSITE
An Improv Show About Disabilities and Mental Health. Come celebrate October being Disabilities Awareness Month!
Join us for another hilarious night of anecdotes and improv provided by storytellers and performers who have two things in common: each is UNIQUE, and they all have disabilities!
Featuring monologists recruited from the disability and mental health community sharing real stories about their lives and a cast of improvisers representing a range of disabilities such as stuttering disorders, autism, PTSD, ADHD, anxiety disorders, depression, and many others! Watch this truly extraordinary troupe of improvisers with diverse disabilities come together as one cohesive unit to create scenes based on stories from people in their community that help us understand the unique challenges of living with a disability or mental health disorder.
Studies show that 1 in 4 individuals have a disability (currently over 1 billion people worldwide); 1 in 3 people will develop a disability within their lifetime, and that 1 in 4 individuals experience a mental health episode annually. Let’s come out and embrace this community on stage and welcome them into our improv world!
UNIQUE is hosted and directed by Kunal Mahajan, a person who has had a lifelong stuttering disability.

EVENT WEBSITE
Musical satire for a good cause is back in action for YEAR 25 when OFF THE RECORD XXV: BURGH TO THE FUTURE! is at the Byham Theater on Oct. 16, 2025. The show's original emcee, LARRY RICHERT, returns, as local unions United Steelworkers, SAG-AFTRA and the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh collaborate with regional performers, broadcasters and community volunteers in an original spoof of Pittsburgh news and newsmakers.
This year’s show time travels to great moments of Pittsburgh’s past, and gazes into the future with hope, pride and lots of laughs. In 2025, we honor OFF THE RECORD stalwarts JON DELANO, KEN RICE and DAVID JOHNSON, and we welcome Allegheny County Controller COREY O’CONNOR to kick off the show.
The annual fundraiser has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for GREATER PITTSBURGH COMMUNITY FOOD BANK.
In a year when $1 = 3 meals for Southwestern Pennsylvanians with food insecurities, we encourage you to donate at pittsburghfoodbank.org/record25 or by texting record25 to 50155.
And of course, get your tickets and come to the Byham for free bites, a paid bar and a few surprises in the lobby, starting at 6:30 p.m. Then at 8 p.m., sit back and enjoy the show!

Take a guided tour of Fourth Avenue, the former Wall Street of Pittsburgh, and learn about the people who commissioned the first skyscrapers here and fueled the city's original stock exchange.

Powerful women who shaped the city with their vision
Champions of racial equality who fought to end slavery and segregation
Master painters whose art was snapped up by Carnegie and Frick
A stock exchange reborn in the '80s as a popular gay bar and drag show cabaret
Tours at 11:00, 12:30, and 2:00
Leading your walking tour is speaker and author Mark Houser, who has taken more than 2,000 people on his Antique Skyscrapers Rooftop Views tours, and Megan Harris, the producer and host of City Cast Pittsburgh.The tour also includes a rare Saturday open house at historic Dollar Bank, the oldest on Fourth Avenue.

Lawrence Convention Center. Help this worthy charity while exploring the city we all love!

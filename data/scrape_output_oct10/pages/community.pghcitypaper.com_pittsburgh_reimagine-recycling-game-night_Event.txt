Get ready for the most unique, innovative, and entertaining game night of 2025 at Reimagined Recycling's second annual fundraiser!
This year we will be bringing the fun and sustainability with games constructed from our recycled plastic sheets. Get ready to try your hand at cornhole, big jenga, hookie and more!
On top of all of that, there will be food, drinks, friendship bracelet making with recycled plastic beads, and the chance to bid on and win raffle prizes from local businesses, artists, and makers. Make sure to hang out until at least 8pm when raffle winners will be announced.

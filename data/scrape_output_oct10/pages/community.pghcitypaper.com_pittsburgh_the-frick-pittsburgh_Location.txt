Formerly the home of steel baron Henry Clay Frick. Visitors can tour the Frick mansion and grounds — tour guides are knowledgeable, if highly sympathetic to the controversial Frick. (Reservations recommended.) There is also free admission to a car and carriage museum, and a diminutive art gallery featuring special exhibits and works from the Frick collection. Closed Mondays.

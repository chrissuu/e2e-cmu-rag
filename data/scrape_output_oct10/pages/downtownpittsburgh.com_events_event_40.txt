Get Spooky With ENCLAVE This Halloween!
Get ready to celebrate Halloween like never before! On October 31st and November 1st, join us in Pittsburgh for a spooktacular TWO-DAY bar crawl featuring creepy cocktails, outrageous costumes, and an electrifying atmosphere. We’re making our way through Pittsburgh's top bars with exclusive drink deals, Halloween-themed entertainment, and surprises lurking around every corner.
Grab your friends and throw on your most hilarious, horrifying, or out-of-this-world outfits—because this night is all about bold looks and big scares. Each stop on the crawl will bring a new vibe, from bone-rattling beats to ghoulishly good drinks.
Whether you're dressed as a vampire, villain, or just out to vibe, this is the place to be for Halloween night. Pittsburgh is turning up the fright and fun — and you won’t want to miss a moment.

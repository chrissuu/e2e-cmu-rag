Working Breed and Edge of The X Presents: No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom 30th Anniversary Tribute
Originally planned for April 2020 but postponed by the pandemic, this long-awaited show is finally hitting the stage—on the exact 30th anniversary of No Doubt’s breakthrough album. Expect a fully immersive tribute curated by Pittsburgh’s Working Breed, known for their theatrical live shows, and featuring special guests from The Commonheart, Cisco Kid, River City Brass, and more, plus an opening set by Heading North and a special surprise from Timbeleza’s Brazilian drumline with a show-closing set.
A portion of proceeds will support Girls Rock! Pittsburgh.

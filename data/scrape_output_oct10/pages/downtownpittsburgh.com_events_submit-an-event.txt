Submit an Event
Thank you for your interest in submitting an event to our online calendar. Please take a look at our calendar first – your event may already be online!
All events must take place in Downtown Pittsburgh focusing on the Golden Triangle but extending to the North Shore, Station Square, and up to and including the Senator John Heinz History Center in the Strip District.
Please write entries in the third-person (“Name of Organization is hosting…” rather than “We are hosting…”)
Note that all submissions are reviewed by PDP staff prior to appearing on the live site, and may be edited for length/clarity/appropriate content.

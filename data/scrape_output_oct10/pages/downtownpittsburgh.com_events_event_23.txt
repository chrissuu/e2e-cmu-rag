Downtown Pittsburgh
EVENT WEBSITE
Join Walk the Burgh for their cocktail tour! From the mill to the still, whiskey has been a cornerstone in Pittsburgh's history. Come downtown for their whiskey tour where you will discover how whiskey has fueled political, labor and social movements throughout the region.
Begin and end your tour in style with a Prohibition cocktail at the Ritual House and an Old Fashioned at the Rebel Room. As you walk the streets of Downtown, along iconic architecture, you'll learn about the violent Whiskey Rebellion in Pittsburgh, hidden former (as well as existing!) speakeasies around the city, and how Prohibition affected the region.
***Please note: This is NOT a bar crawl but a whiskey history tour that includes two handcrafted cocktails. This event is 21+ only, no minors please.

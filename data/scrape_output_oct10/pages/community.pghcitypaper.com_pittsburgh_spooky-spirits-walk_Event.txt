Get in the spooky spirit with a fall beverage and explore the macabre, haunting history of Pittsburgh’s East End on a guided walk of The Frick Pittsburgh’s grounds. From Pittsburgh’s link to the “crime of the century” to the real life origins of the city’s most enduring urban legends, discover the darker side of the East End. Following the tour, each attendee will receive a sweet treat to take home.
Tours available at 6:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. each date!

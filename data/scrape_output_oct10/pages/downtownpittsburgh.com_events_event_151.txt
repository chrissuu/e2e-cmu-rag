For this special screening, local composer and performer Tom Roberts will perform live with his own original score for the film.
From world-renowned director F.W Murnau, this classic piece of German cinema demonstrates the limitless possibilities of storytelling. Dare to enter Count Orlok’s castle, where the macabre takes human form and feasts on the innocent! Follow Thomas Hutter as he travels to the secluded Transylvanian castle and witnesses a nightmare come to life in the shape of a vampire! When the Count develops a craving for Hutter’s wife, Hutter must race against the clock to protect her from falling victim to Orlok’s desires. One of the first breakthroughs in gothic horror, Nosferatu’s chilling tale continues to haunt audiences more than a century after its release.
"It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us. It shows not that vampires can jump out of shadows, but that evil can grow there, nourished on death." - Roger Ebert.

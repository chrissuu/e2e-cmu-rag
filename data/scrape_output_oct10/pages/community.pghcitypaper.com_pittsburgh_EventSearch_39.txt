Soul’d Out Supper is "dinner church" held every Sunday night at 6:30 in the upper room at the Elrama Tavern on State Route 837 in Elrama, PA. All are welcome!
The early church began around the dinner table. We have discovered that this form of worship appeals to some who would like a more casual form of worship, where they can participate in discussion, ask questions and enjoy fellowship in a non-threatening environment. Dinner is delicious and free, but an offering is accepted to continue and support this excellent ministry outside the walls of a church building.

Each member brings years of live performance experience, contributing to the band’s polished and professional sound. Smacked has built a strong local following through consistent performances at regional venues and festivals. Their live shows balance accuracy with the kind of grit and edge that made Godsmack a mainstay in modern rock. For fans of Godsmack, Smacked offers an authentic tribute experience rooted in respect and high-quality musicianship.PitterA, is your ultimate tribute to the legendary Pantera, capturing the ferocity and groove that defined the metal scene of the '90s. With a relentless dedication to replicating the powerful sound and explosive energy of Pantera’s iconic lineup, PitterA brings the essence of "Vulgar Display of Power" and "Far Beyond Driven" to life. From the crushing riffs to the guttural vocals, every performance is a nod to the heavy metal greatness of Dimebag Darrell, Phil Anselmo, Rex Brown, and Vinnie Paul. Get ready to experience the raw, unfiltered intensity of Pantera once again with PitterA, where every show is a headbanging, sweat-soaked tribute to one of metal’s greatest.Frequently asked questionsDOES THIS EVENT HAVE ANY AGE RESTRICTIONS?

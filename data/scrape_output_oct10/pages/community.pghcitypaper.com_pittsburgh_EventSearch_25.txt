Soul‚Äôd Out Supper is "dinner church" held every Sunday night at 6:30 in the upper room at the Elrama Tavern on State Route 837 in Elrama, PA. All are welcome!

Dinner is delicious and free, but an offering is accepted to continue and support this excellent ministry outside the walls of a church building.

For four nights, MQCFest takes over Arcade Comedy Theater and 880 Wrestling with more than 60 queer comedians from across the country. This year’s highlights include Helen Wildy closing out the festival, the groundbreaking all-trans Here to Pee Tour, the powerhouse late-night showcase Perfect 10s, and the all-Black lineup of #TheBlackout.
Single tickets start at $17, and festival passes guarantee your spot at the biggest shows of the weekend. Seating is first-come, first-served — don’t wait to grab your tickets.

“Hurdle-isms” Book Talk with Clint Hurdle
Oct 26, 2025 - Oct 26, 2025
Heinz History Center
1212 Smallman Street																Pittsburgh, PA 15222
EVENT WEBSITE
Presented by the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, this special program will feature a presentation from Hurdle, one of Major League Baseball’s most inspirational figures, who will share thought-provoking stories from his new book.
Listen to recollections from his time as a player, coach, and manager, and discover how both triumphs and setbacks have shaped his career and life.
As manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Hurdle’s leadership led the Bucs to three playoff appearances and ended the team’s 20-year losing streak. He also built a dedicated group of followers who looked forward to his daily group text containing words of encouragement, hope, and strength. These “hurdle-isms,” humorous and profound, take you on a journey through his storied career.
Whether you bleed black and gold or just love a great baseball story, the book talk will offer a behind-the-scenes look into Hurdle’s experiences on and off the field and the wit and wisdom they inspired.
Following the program, Hurdle will sign copies of his book for attendees. The book will be available for purchase at the program.

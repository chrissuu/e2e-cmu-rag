About the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership
Who We Are
Formed by Downtown businesses, professionals, civic organizations, foundations, and residents, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (PDP) is a non-profit community development organization that develops and implements innovative programs and initiatives to enhance the Downtown neighborhood, cultivate a vibrant residential population, and stimulate a diverse retail community.
We also promote and market this great urban center to millions of people as the region’s premier destination to do business, to call home, or to visit for the best in shopping, dining, and entertainment. The PDP stands as staunch advocates for all those who make Downtown part of their lives—from businesses to workers to residents and visitors.
Our Mission
To lead Downtown’s transformation with innovative programs that drive growth, vibrancy, and engagement.
Our Vision
Downtown Pittsburgh will lead the region as the dynamic center where visitors play, workers thrive, and residents proudly call home.
Our Values
Service | Leadership | Innovation | Community | Engagement
Managing the Business Improvement District
The Downtown Pittsburgh Business Improvement District (BID) was created by City Council in 1997 and renewed for a fourth, five-year term in November 2015 at the request of the Downtown Property Owners. Through the BID, property owners within the Golden Triangle agree to assess themselves to pay for services, provided by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, that directly benefit Downtown Pittsburgh, such as cleaning, safety, marketing, and transportation initiatives.
The BID includes 100 blocks of the Central Business District and the boundaries are within the Golden Triangle. More than 4,000 businesses and 350 property owners are located within the BID area. Read more about the Downtown Pittsburgh BID.
Our Funding
The PDP has five main funding sources to support its initiatives.
First, as the management entity for Downtown’s Business improvement District (BID), the PDP receives funding from assessments paid by Downtown property owners and operates in agreement with the City of Pittsburgh to manage BID activities. Second, it receives dues from voluntary members who want to invest in the future of Downtown. Third, through the support of foundations for important project-specific activities. Fourth, government grants, and fifth, through earnings from advertising, fees, and sponsorships.

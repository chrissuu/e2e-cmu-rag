Emotions Anonymous is a support program designed to help folks with emotional difficulties in their efforts to live more manageable lives.
Based on the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous but open to all, we use the same guidelines and fellowship to support each other as we deal with stress and out of control emotions. This is not a replacement for regular therapy but a helpful addition led by volunteers who have found the program helpful.

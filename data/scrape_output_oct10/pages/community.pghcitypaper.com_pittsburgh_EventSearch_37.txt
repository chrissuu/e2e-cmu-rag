Tips
Acoustic
You write songs? Where you playing at Saturday night? Why not?
Remember Graffiti? It used to market itself as "the Greenwich Village Scene of Pittsburgh." Do you even know about the Greenwich Village scene? If you don't you should.
Yes. Even the legendary voices of the Greenwich Village scene passed a hat and split the proceeds. And they came out to support each other. Not everyone got famous. Not everyone had a hit record. But they made something happen.
Genius emerges from community.
So if you write songs, get off your butt and get out and play.

Quite fortuitously, The Golden Age of Book Illustration and The Golden Age of Fairy Tales reached their heights between 1890 and 1920 — the exact timeframe of the Frick’s exhibition, The Scandinavian Home: Landscapes and Lore. To take advantage of this creative overlap, The Frick Pittsburgh presents a lecture that celebrates Denmark’s world-renown master of enchantment, Hans Christian Andersen, alongside the noted artists who transformed his powerful words into equally powerful illustrations.

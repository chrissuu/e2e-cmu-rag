Best of PGH 2025

There’s this general understanding among Pittsburghers, be they born and raised here, transplants, or expats, that this city is just … inarguably the best. Sure, outsiders are generous with that accolade, with national media naming us the most livable and most affordable city — which mostly elicits eyerolls at this point.
But none of that approval is what makes us feel the way we feel. If you live here, you just get it. There’s something intangible about this city — a magnetic draw — that makes you never really want to live anywhere else, because nowhere else quite compares.
That’s a big reason why Pittsburgh City Paper’s annual Best of PGH issue is so incredibly fun to put together. It gives us a chance to celebrate all the best things in this very best city, and we get to do it with you, the readers. Every year you show up in droves to share your new, cool finds, and tried-and-true favorites. This year, more than 20,000 of you cast a whopping 382,795 votes, stomping last year’s tally.
Now, behold! We have our winners! Hundreds of people, places, and businesses have been crowned by you in categories like Best Pizza, Best Club DJ, and Best Entrepreneur all the way to Best Bluesky Account, Best Bus Stop, and new this year: Best Local Controversy.
So keep this list handy and treat it as your key to the city. Make it your own personal restaurant guide or the place you check before booking an appointment … or just peruse it when you feel like puffing your chest with Pittsburgh pride.

About This Event
Taking place at the new Hazelwood Brewing Company, which houses both Abstract Realm and New France breweries, the “Building Trails, Building Bridges” fundraiser and networking event is both a celebration of the progress so far on the trail, and also a recognition of the fact that we don’t make trails happen alone.
KEYNOTE: Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato
Without our community partners and the support of many dedicated companies, organizations, and individuals across our region, we wouldn’t have a trail – let alone more than 35 miles and counting.
The “bridges” we build through that support are why the Three Rivers Heritage Trail and Water Trail exist.
We will be presenting two awards at our event:
Trailblazer Partner Award Winner: Duquesne Light Company
Martin O’Malley Award Winner: Chris Blackwell, former Director of Planning for Penn Hills
This event will feature:
Beer from Abstract Realm and New France Brewing and N/A options
Heavy appetizers and selected bites with vegetarian and vegan options from Comfort and Spice
A Bigger-than-ever Building Bridges Auction and Raffle
Become a Building Bridges, Building Trails sponsor.

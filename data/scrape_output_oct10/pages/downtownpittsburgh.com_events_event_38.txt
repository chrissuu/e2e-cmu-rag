EVENT WEBSITE
Co-Workers takes you behind the scenes of an everyday office where anything but the usual happens! This show weaves quick, dynamic short-form games into a larger long-form narrative, all set within the chaos of an office environment. Watch as our talented cast brings quirky coworkers, awkward meetings, and office politics to life while seamlessly shifting between rapid-fire games and a mostly connected story. Every show is unique, with suggestions from the audience shaping the characters and situations on the fly. From breakroom banter to unexpected company-wide crises, Co-Workers delivers a one-of-a-kind experience full of laughs, surprises, and workplace absurdity. It's the only office where you'll want to stay late!

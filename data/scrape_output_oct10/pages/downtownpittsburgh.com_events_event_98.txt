Arcade Comedy Theater presents Penny Arcade, an interactive comedy experience ideal for kids 4 to 8 years old! This 45-minute show encourages children and their parents to unleash their imaginations and sense of humor. Penny Arcade fosters collaboration, listening skills, and silliness for everyone at any age through a hands-on approach to theater. Whether your child is a natural performer or a thoughtful observer, the show adapts to each individual, giving everyone a unique and hilarious experience they’ll talk about for a long time! Penny Arcade is a fun and innovative show you won’t find anywhere else in the city. Important information:
Runtime: 60 minutes
Tickets $12 per person (discounts for groups of 4 or 6)
Suitable for ALL ages
Parents must be present at all times
The theater is accessible for guests in wheelchairs and strollers
Child-appropriate concessions available
What to Expect
Penny Arcade was designed to include activities and subject matter appropriate for kids aged 4 to 8 — the experience is a fun, goofy time for everyone in the room! Through games and activities, guests will learn about the foundations of improv comedy: collaboration, support, and listening. Kids can hop up and interact with the performers, use their imaginations, and get silly. By the end of the show, every guest is a “Penny Player” and has the opportunity to engage with the show and unleash their sense of humor! While we encourage everyone in the room to engage with the production, it’s not a requirement. Children are encouraged to do what’s most comfortable for them. There are moments when everyone will be sitting down watching a live comedy performance, and when we’re all dancing and moving about the space. Quiet rooms will also be available if a family needs to step out and take a break.

Downtown Activation + Public Art
Creating beautiful, inviting streets and public spaces through public art
Developed in 2013, the Downtown Activation and Public Art initiative is a multi-year effort to enhance the Downtown neighborhood through public art events, creating thoughtful and innovative programming that enlivens unique areas throughout Downtown Pittsburgh. Our efforts employ object-, programming-, and community-based strategies to create a more sustainable neighborhood.
Over the past few years, the PDP has successfully implemented a number of programs to enhance the vibrancy of Downtown, from the transformation of Market Square and the expansion of our programming to the installation of public art in Strawberry Way. To build upon these efforts, the PDP will continue to initiate a range of programs and installations that enliven Downtown.

With support from the PDP’s Uncommon & Curated Fund and a grant provided by the Colcom Foundation, the Shadow Gallery was created by Pittsburgh-based lighting design and production firm Clear Story, and is now operational in the evening hours.
“The installation creates an experiential conversation between the patterns of light projection across the surfaces of Coffey Way and the images contained within the lightboxes,” said Rob Long, Principal and Design Director of Clear Story, a Pittsburgh-based design and consulting firm.
Elemental, 2024by Carolina Loyola-GarciaOne Oxford Centre
Elemental is a site-specific multi-channel video installation designed to showcase a loop of nature videos depicting the ocean, an active erupting volcano, snow, wind, sunsets, clouds, and flora. The alternating footage of nature provides passersby a moment to wonder and a window into worlds far from the downtown business atmosphere. It is meant to serve as a moment of respite or as an invitation to a few minutes of meditation or solace. Read artist statement.

Complemented by poet Jhordan Price near the corner of Seventh Ave and William Penn Place, Dawson’s work invites pedestrians and drivers to pause in their commutes and journeys to contemplate the life and joys of residents of the Hill District today.

For the inaugural installation, a regional call for artists was conducted by Shiftworks, leading the selection of a painting by Pittsburgh-based Mexican American artist Rigel Richardson titled Good Service, a work inspired by the nature found in backyards and gardens in Millvale.

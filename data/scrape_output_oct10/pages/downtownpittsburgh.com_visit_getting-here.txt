Getting Around
Getting here and around Downtown Pittsburgh is easier than ever
With more than 80 bus and light rail routes serving Downtown daily, relaxing while you let someone else do the driving into town makes commuting a breeze. Downtown is the most walkable neighborhood in Pittsburgh, whether you’re a long-time yinzer or new to the city. Plus, biking, carsharing, and parking are all available and easy to do. Explore more below.
Walking | Biking | Bike Share | Public Transit | Inclines | Rail |Paratransit | Parking | Driving |Tools & Resources
Walking
Did you know you can walk from one end of Downtown to the other in 25 minutes or less? Getting to major destinations like sports stadiums, museums, restaurants, and more is accomplished easily on foot. Enjoy the Three Rivers Heritage Trail system for 24 miles of riverfront trails providing access to city neighborhoods, business districts, and local attractions, and cross both the Fort Pitt and Fort Duquesne Bridges with dedicated pedestrian walkways.
Biking
Explore Downtown using dedicated and protected bike lanes throughout the neighborhood. Use the new Mon Wharf Switchback Ramp to effortlessly bike from Point State Park to Smithfield Street, the Three Rivers Heritage Trail, and beyond.
Learn more about biking in Pittsburgh, including how-to videos, maps, tips and tricks, and more at BikePGH.org.
POGOH Bike Share
POGOH is Pittsburgh’s public bike-sharing system and as of May 2022, the system has been revamped and now includes new stations, equipment, and services. Rides start at $3.50 for 30 minute rides on standard bikes and $5.00 for 30 minute rides on e-pedal assist bikes. Learn more and check out the updated system map.
Public Transit
Take a break from the car and don’t worry about the stress of traffic: hop on a Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) bus or light rail train for easy travel into and out of Downtown seven days a week. One-way fares on light rail and buses are $2.75 for both Connectcard and cash users; children up to age 5 ride free with a fare-paying adult. Plan your public transit trip.
The Light Rail system connects the North Shore and Downtown Pittsburgh to the South Hills neighborhoods, including stops nearby Heinz Field, PNC Park, and Rivers Casino. Travel around quickly in the light rail free fare zone with unlimited free travel between the First Side and North Shore stops.
PRT and other bus services connect Downtown to neighborhoods and destinations throughout the region. Bus service to the airport is available on the 28X – Airport Flyer, with a limited number of stops between Downtown and Pittsburgh International Airport.
Heading to the East End? A dedicated bus-only road provides fast travel between Downtown and the East End communities, including Shadyside, East Liberty, Wilkinsburg, and Swissvale.
Make your transit ride even smoother with a ConnectCard. Available for purchase at the Downtown Service Station and Downtown light rail stations, this refillable card acts like cash and can store weekly, monthly, and annual passes. Transfers are free within 3 hours using a ConnectCard.
Mobile payment is also available for all PRT trips. Just download the Transit App and use your smartphone to purchase fares on the go.

Parking
Did you know that anywhere you are in Downtown, you’re only a five-minute walk from a parking garage? When you do have to drive, check ParkPGH.org for the real-time status of parking garages before you arrive.
On-street, metered parking is available throughout the neighborhood, but be sure to check all posted signage for special event closures, valets, and other restrictions. On-street parking in permitted areas is free after 6:00 p.m. Monday – Saturday and all-day on Sundays and major holidays.

Volunteer in Downtown Pittsburgh
Get out and about while safely working on projects that help create a more vibrant and beautiful Downtown.
As people begin returning to the neighborhood, volunteers are needed now, more than ever, to preserve, beautify, and clean up our historic Downtown. Volunteering with our highly-acclaimed Clean Team is an impactful way to get outside and enjoy the neighborhood while also ensuring it remains a welcoming space for all.
And, of course, your safety is a priority. All volunteers will follow proper health and safety protocols, social distancing, and face masks/covering requirements to stay safe while working effectively.
Volunteer Projects
Our volunteers work weekdays and weekends on a wide variety of projects. Volunteer initiatives all revolve around our mission to make Downtown vibrant, clean, and accessible, and can include picking up litter, cleaning graffiti, weeding public spaces and parks, raking leaves, and cleaning public fixtures like newspaper boxes, light fixtures, and bus shelters.
Additionally, volunteers may be mobilized following large events like parades, celebrations, and more. Our volunteers are a crucial part of ensuring residents, workers, and visitors always see an energetic city in motion, and we could not accomplish what we do without their help!
Get Involved & Make an Impact
Whether you’re a Downtown resident looking to help keep the neighborhood clean, a corporate team looking for an out-of-office experience to give back to the community, a school group planning a service day, or just someone interested in making Downtown Pittsburgh shine, we can craft a volunteer experience suited to your needs.
Visit our volunteer scheduling page on the Pittsburgh Cares hub to browse available volunteer dates and register for upcoming opportunities.

Thank you!
We’re greatly appreciative of the organizations and corporations, along with the countless residents, visitors, and individuals that have joined our Clean Team in building a vibrant Downtown.

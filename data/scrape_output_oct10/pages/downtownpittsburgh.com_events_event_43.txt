Michael Misko in "I Laugh in the Face of Magic"
Aug 15, 2025 - Nov 1, 2025
Liberty Magic
811 Liberty Ave																Pittsburgh, PA 15222
EVENT WEBSITE
Prepare to laugh 'til it hurts and question reality in the best way possible—Michael's comedy magic show is anything but ordinary. Described as “90% comedy. The other half is magic,” this unforgettable performance blends razor-sharp wit with jaw-dropping sleight-of-hand for a night of entertainment that’s equal parts hilarious and astonishing.
Once called “the Zach Galifianakis of magic,” Michael’s deadpan delivery and masterful illusions have left audiences—and even fellow comedians—raving. T.J. Miller called his stage presence “unmatchable,” while Brian Regan joked, “I loved the part where you harpooned the guy in the chest!”
Michael originated the role of the “Magic Maker” in Stephen Schwartz’s Magic to Do and appears on the show’s Original Cast Album. When he’s not consulting for Fortune 500 companies or touring internationally, you might catch him performing on cruise ships, in comedy clubs, or at college campuses around the globe.
Based in Pittsburgh with his wife, three daughters, and one very scruffy dog, Michael brings a show that’s smart, surprising, and seriously funny. Don’t miss your chance to see what happens when world-class magic meets laugh-out-loud comedy.

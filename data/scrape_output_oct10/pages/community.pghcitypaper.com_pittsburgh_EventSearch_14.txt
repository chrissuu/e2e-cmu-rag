Featuring Collegiate Talent from The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, and Community College of Allegheny County. MCs pick various themes and each crew has a set amount of time to mix and play the best tracks inspired by that theme, with the crowd choosing the winner!

EVENT WEBSITE
Bill (David Strathairn) is a pillar of his Southern community: a business owner, a veteran, and the proud patriarch of an unruly but loving family. His daughter Patti (Anna Camp) has returned home after the collapse of her marriage, while his son David (Will Pullen) struggles to stay afloat. He has brought David into the family business, but harbors doubts about his discipline and commitment. Bill gravitates towards Tammy (Jane Levy), his daughter-in-law and the only other person in his rambunctious household who values contemplation and repose. When Bill begins to suspect that David may be straying from his marital vows with a coworker (Dascha Polanco), the father must confront the perplexing inscrutability of his son’s choices and their consequences for the rest of the family. A heart-tugging drama about finding kindred spirits in unexpected places, A Little Prayer is a sensitive and searching portrait of an American family from writer-director Angus MacLachlan.

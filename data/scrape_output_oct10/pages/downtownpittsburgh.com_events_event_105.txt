EVENT WEBSITE
Cinema’s The 4th Witch is told through shadow puppetry, actors in silhouette and live music (without dialogue or narration). This feature-length work inspired by Shakespeare’s Macbeth, depicts the story of a young girl, orphaned from war, who becomes apprenticed to three witches.
The 4th Witch begins on the eve of an invasion of a small town by the local warlord, Macbeth. The girl flees the invading army and escapes into the nearby forest. There, she is rescued by the witches. They agree to take the girl on as an apprentice, on the condition that she must never use her powers for revenge. Consumed by grief and rage, the girl comes to realize that it was Macbeth who killed her father – and that she must choose between reconciliation or vengeance.
The 4th Witch explores themes of grief, war, generational conflict, and cycles of violence through the collateral damage left behind on the battleground.

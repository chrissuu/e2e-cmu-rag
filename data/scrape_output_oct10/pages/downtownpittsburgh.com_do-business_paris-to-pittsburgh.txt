Paris to Pittsburgh
Colcom Foundation Matching Grant Program
Paris to Pittsburgh is a matching grant program to assist property and business owners with exterior enhancements to enhance the public realm. The program offers 2 grants, one to encourage outdoor cafes and sidewalk activation, and one to improve or restore existing building façades. The 50 percent matching grants are available to fund eligible projects that enliven the Golden Triangle streetscape using high-quality, pedestrian-oriented design elements.
Sidewalk Activation Grant
Inspired by the vibrant streets of Paris, the Paris to Pittsburgh Sidewalk Activation Grant encourages outdoor dining elements such as retractable awnings, tables and chairs, new lighting and landscaping. The project requires a 50 percent match and offers grants of up to $50,000.
Façade Grant
A 50 percent matching grant, the Façade Grant offers up to $50,000 to properties that are interested in façade improvements but are not adding an outdoor café or installing an operable storefront. Retail and service businesses are the ideal target candidates for this program.

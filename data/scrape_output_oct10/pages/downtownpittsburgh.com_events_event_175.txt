EVENT WEBSITE
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre (PBT)’s Pointe in Time fundraiser is a top 10 annual event that brings over 400 arts patrons together in support of PBT’s programming, including arts education in schools and community centers, classes for individuals with disabilities and funding for its Community Youth Scholarship program.
Now in its thirteenth year, Community Youth Scholarship recipients range from Pre-ballet (age 5) to the more advanced level 8, with an average of five new students accepted into the program each year. Scholarships cover all tuition costs (school year and summer) as well as associated costs (pointe shoes, leotards and tights), is guaranteed for as long as students continue training at PBT School, and costs up to $70,000 per student.

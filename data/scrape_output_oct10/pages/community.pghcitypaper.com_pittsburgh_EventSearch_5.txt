This exhibition celebrates the extraordinary life and work of Rafael Lucas Rodr√≠guez Caballero, Costa Rican botanist, artist and educator. Rodr√≠guez (1915‚Äì1981) lived a life defined by artistic brilliance and scientific precision. Though his life was cut short by Hodgkin lymphoma at age 66, he left behind a staggering array of botanical illustrations, scientific writings, jewelry designs and humorous cartoons. A gifted artist and a devoted naturalist, Rodr√≠guez refused to choose between science and art, embracing both equally. Join us Tuesday, 16 September, 5:00-7:00 p.m. for the opening reception.

Ting Tong Chang (b.1982, Taipei) is an artist who lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan and Santiago de Compostela, Spain and has exhibited internationally.

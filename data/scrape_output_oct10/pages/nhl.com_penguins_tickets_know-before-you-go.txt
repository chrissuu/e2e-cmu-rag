Mobile Ticketing
PPG Paints Arena is a mobile-only facility. For game entry, a mobile ticket must be displayed on a smartphone. Ticket buyers and fans that received forwarded tickets can access their tickets by visiting www.pittsburghpenguins.com/myaccount or the Penguins app.
All mobile tickets will feature a rotating barcode. As a result, camera screenshots or paper printouts will not work. If you place your digital ticket in your Apple wallet, no barcode will be visible - however, the scanners will detect it! If you do not have a mobile ticket for entry, you will be directed to the DICK'S Sporting Goods Box Office inside the Highmark Gate for assistance.

Hockey Etiquette
As a show of hockey etiquette, and as a courtesy to others, we ask that you wait until there is a stoppage of play before leaving or returning to your seat. Also, please refrain from leaning forward, as it may obstruct the view of others seated behind you.
For the comfort and safety of your fellow fans, please keep aisles clear. Standing behind the last row of seats is prohibited unless designated by a Standing Room Only ticket.

This exhibition celebrates the extraordinary life and work of Rafael Lucas Rodríguez Caballero, Costa Rican botanist, artist and educator. Rodríguez (1915–1981) lived a life defined by artistic brilliance and scientific precision. Though his life was cut short by Hodgkin lymphoma at age 66, he left behind a staggering array of botanical illustrations, scientific writings, jewelry designs and humorous cartoons. A gifted artist and a devoted naturalist, Rodríguez refused to choose between science and art, embracing both equally. Join us Tuesday, 16 September, 5:00-7:00 p.m. for the opening reception.

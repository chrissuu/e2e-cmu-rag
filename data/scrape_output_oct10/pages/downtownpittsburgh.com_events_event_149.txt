Multi-GRAMMY® and Academy Award® winner Jon Batiste brings his Big Money Tour: Jon Batiste Plays America to Heinz Hall as part of his highly anticipated, second-ever headlining run. This unforgettable night in Pittsburgh is one stop on a dynamic journey across more than 30 cities nationwide, including iconic venues like Red Rocks, the Grand Ole Opry, and a special co-bill with Diana Ross.
Each night of The Big Money Tour will unfold like a multi-act musical journey connecting audiences to Batiste’s roots, his evolution, and the movement he’s building through music. Featuring selections from his critically acclaimed catalog alongside new material performed live for the first time, the show blends structure with spontaneity and becomes what he describes as “creative church”—a space for joy, openness, and collective experience. “We’re living in a complicated time, and music has this incredible ability to reframe what we’re feeling, to help us keep going,” he says. “These shows are meant to be healing, liberating, and unforgettable.”
“At the heart of what I’m about is representing the cultural music I come from and taking responsibility to push it forward,” Batiste says. “That’s jazz. That’s blues. That’s soul. That’s country and gospel music—forms born from people coming together, improvising in real time, and expressing something deeper. I can’t wait to channel that energy live every night—it’s where the music hits its truest form.”

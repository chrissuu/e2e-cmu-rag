Downtown Mobility Plan
The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership is leading the development of a Downtown Pittsburgh Mobility Plan (DMP) designed to make the Downtown area easier to navigate for all who work in, live in, and visit the Golden Triangle. The Plan will analyze data and collect public input to identify issues and prioritize opportunities to improve the Downtown experience for all users, especially during peak travel times.

About the Mobility Plan
The Mobility Plan will build on lessons learned from Envision Downtown, an initiative launched in 2015 by Mayor William Peduto and the PDP to pilot mobility improvement projects aimed at preparing Downtown for the significant revitalization that’s occurring as a result of more than $5.2 billion in real estate and transportation investment over the last decade.
The evolution of Downtown will continue to impact how people get around and experience the neighborhood with an additional $3.8 billion in investments currently in the pipeline. The Mobility Plan will identify ways to improve the pedestrian, transit, biking, vehicle, and delivery experience while prioritizing future projects to ensure Downtown continues to be a vibrant economic, cultural, and transportation hub for our region.

Proposed Guiding Principles
Guiding Principles serve as the vision for the Plan and a framework to organize priorities and identify projects. Through our review of the Issues and Opportunities Report, feedback from the Downtown Advisory Group (DAG), and survey results from the public there was a strong consensus
that the proposed Guiding Principles below represent the values and
aspirations for the future of mobility in Downtown Pittsburgh.
Welcoming & Vibrant: Downtown Pittsburgh’s mobility system should embrace Downtown’s status as a diverse and interesting place while ensuring everyone feels safe.People-first & Transit-prioritized: Downtown Pittsburgh’s mobility system should strengthen the walkability of Downtown while providing high-quality transit service and amenities.Equitable & Affordable: Downtown Pittsburgh’s mobility system should ensure Downtown is accessible for all, regardless of means or abilities.
Intuitive & Coherent: Downtown Pittsburgh’s mobility system should get people where they need to go while balancing street and curb demands, particularly during peak periods.Adaptable & Healthy: Downtown Pittsburgh’s mobility system should be building and maintaining infrastructure and advancing policies that support the dynamic needs of Downtown and improve public health.Regionally Focused & Nationally Competitive: Downtown Pittsburgh’s mobility system should contribute to the shared economic growth of the region while striving to be a leader among peer cities.

Partners
The Mobility Plan is guided by a Management Team comprised of the PDP, the City of Pittsburgh’s Departments of Mobility & Infrastructure and City Planning, Port Authority of Allegheny County, and the Southwest Pennsylvania Commission.
In fall 2019, the PDP, with the support the Management Team, selected a consultant team to facilitate the development of a Downtown Mobility Plan over the next year led by Arup, a global leader in urban design and mobility planning and supported by Utile, Nelson\Nygaard, SmithGroup, and MonWin Consulting, who all bring a mix of national experience and local expertise.
The Mobility Plan is funded by a $1 million grant from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation in service to their mission to inspire, invest in, and leverage great ideas and initiatives for outcomes that improve the quality of life in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania.

The Fort Pitt Museum, located in historic Point State Park in downtown Pittsburgh, is a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot museum that tells the story of Western Pennsylvania’s pivotal role during the French & Indian War, the American Revolution, and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh.
The strategic location of the fort – at the Forks of the Ohio River – helped to shape the course of American and world history.
First opened in 1969 in a reconstructed bastion, the Fort Pitt Museum provides visitors with a rich understanding of the world-changing events that occurred right here in Western Pennsylvania.
Through interactive exhibitions, life-like historical figures, and recently added artifacts, visitors will learn the important role our region played in shaping the United States.

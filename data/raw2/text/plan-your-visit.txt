At The Frick Pittsburgh, get ready to experience art, history, and nature. To ensure you enjoy as much as possible during your visit, check our calendar for all offerings and get your tickets in advance. Clayton tours are limited and do sell out! For the best experience, begin your visit at Grable Visitor Center. A Museum Experience Associate will orient you to our campus and help you purchase day-of tickets, if available.

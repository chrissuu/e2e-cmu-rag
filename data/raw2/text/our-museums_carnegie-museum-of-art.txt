Pittsburgh’s home for great art. And home to the Carnegie International.
Carnegie Museum of Art creates experiences that connect people to art, ideas, and one another. It opened in 1895 as the nation’s first museum dedicated to collecting the art of its times.
Since 1896, the Carnegie International has been the museum’s most significant exhibition as well as its leading contribution to the field. With each International, the museum writes another chapter in its history.

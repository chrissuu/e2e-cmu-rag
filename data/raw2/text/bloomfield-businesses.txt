We welcome the new comers, the regulars, the young and the old, we don’t have a preference, you don’t have to fit any mold. From beer, whiskey, soda and tea — no judgments are made, for this you will see. Burgers, fries, salads, & soup too, why not bring a friend or maybe the whole crew. So whether you’re bored, hungry, or out for a good time, remember to keep Lot 17 in mind.

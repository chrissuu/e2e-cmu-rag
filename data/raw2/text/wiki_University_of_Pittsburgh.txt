The University of Pittsburgh ( Pitt ) is a state-related research university in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States. The university is composed of seventeen undergraduate and graduate schools and colleges at its urban Pittsburgh campus, home to the university's central administration and around 28,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The 132-acre Pittsburgh campus includes various historic buildings that are part of the Schenley Farms Historic District , most notably its 42-story Gothic revival centerpiece, the Cathedral of Learning . Pitt is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity". [ 8 ]
Pitt traces its roots to the Pittsburgh Academy founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge in 1787. While the city was still on the edge of the American frontier at the time, Pittsburgh's rapid growth meant that a proper university was soon needed, and Pitt's charter was altered in 1819 to confer university status on it as the Western University of Pennsylvania . After surviving two fires and several relocations, the university moved to its current location in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood, and by act of the state legislature was renamed the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. Pitt was a private institution until 1966, when it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education .
The campus is situated adjacent to the flagship medical facilities of its closely affiliated University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and its flagship hospital, UPMC Presbyterian , as well as the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh , Schenley Park , and Carnegie Mellon University . The university also operates four undergraduate branch campuses in Western Pennsylvania , located in Bradford , Greensburg , Johnstown , and Titusville . In athletics, Pitt competes in Division I of the NCAA as the Pittsburgh Panthers , primarily as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference .
Founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the few universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the United States. It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S. west of the Allegheny Mountains . The school began as a preparatory school, presumably in a log cabin , possibly as early as 1770 [ 10 ] in Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier. [ 11 ] Brackenridge obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] A brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy. [ 14 ] The small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above. [ 16 ]
Western University of Pennsylvania
Within a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status. The school was named the Western University of Pennsylvania , or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia . [ 13 ] [ 17 ] By 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional liberal education in favor of the state legislature's desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.
The university's buildings, along with most of its records and files, were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1845 that wiped out 20 square blocks of Pittsburgh. Classes were temporarily held in Trinity Church until a new building was constructed on Duquesne Way (on what was the site of the former Horne's department store). Four years later, in 1849, this building also was destroyed by fire. Due to the catastrophic nature of these fires, operations were suspended for a few years to allow the university time to regroup and rebuild. By 1854, WUP had erected a new building on the corner of Ross and Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) streets (site of the present day City-County building ) and classes resumed in 1855. It is during this era, in 1867, that Samuel Pierpont Langley , astronomer, inventor, aviation pioneer and future Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution , was chosen as director of the Allegheny Observatory that was donated to WUP in 1865. Langley was professor of astronomy and physics and remained at WUP until 1891, when he was succeeded by another prominent astronomer, James Keeler . Growing quickly during this period, WUP outgrew its downtown facilities and the university moved its campus to Allegheny City (present-day North Side ). [ 19 ] [ 14 ]
The university eventually found itself on a 10-acre (4.0 ha) site on the North Side's Observatory Hill at the location of its Allegheny Observatory . There, it constructed two new buildings, Science Hall and Main Hall, that were occupied by 1889 and 1890 respectively. During this era, the first collegiate football team was formed at Pitt in 1889. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated into the university (now the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine ). By 1893, the university had graduated its first African-American, William Hunter Dammond . [ 20 ] In 1895 WUP established its School of Law, and Andrew Carnegie and George Westinghouse were elected to the board of trustees, where they joined Andrew Mellon , who had been elected in 1894. The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the university in 1896. In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the university. [ 21 ] During this period, university engineering professor Reginald Fessenden was conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting. By 1904, playing at Exposition Park , the university had its first undefeated football team. [ 19 ] [ 14 ] [ 22 ]
A new name and home
Citing a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the University of Pittsburgh in the summer of 1908. During this time, the university had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the North Side and its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years. To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought 43 acres (17 ha) of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909. [ 23 ] The initial campus plan for the new location centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by Henry Hornbostel for 30 buildings. However, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only Thaw Hall remains today. In the fall of 1909, the university became the first college to adopt the panther as its mascot. [ 25 ] It was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor Samuel McCormick , again held off pressures to abandon the school's commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training. During his administration, McCormick also led the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as beginning institutional support of athletics.
In the 1920s, new university chancellor John Gabbert Bowman declared that he had a vision for a centerpiece "tall building" for the university. The 14-acre (5.7 ha) Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo- Gothic Revival plan that today comprises the Cathedral of Learning , Heinz Memorial Chapel , Stephen Foster Memorial , and Clapp Hall buildings. By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by Charles Klauder for the "tall building": an attention-getting 535-foot (163 m) tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the "character that ought to be in an educated man." The building's "parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness" and it would "unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character." The cathedral is "cut off" flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending. The building was financed by donors and by a campaign to collect dimes from local school children. Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the Great Depression intervened, the Cathedral of Learning, on which construction was begun in 1926, began hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937. Today, it remains the second tallest university building in the world and contains an equally impressive interior highlighted by a 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m 2 ) Gothic hall Commons Room with 52-foot-tall (16 m) arches currently surrounded by 31 Nationality Rooms .
Development of the polio vaccine
In the early 20th century, epidemics of polio began to hit the United States and other industrialized countries. As hospitals filled with patients in iron lungs , and tens of thousands were left disabled, the fear of polio grew, leading to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile, Jonas Salk had set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now Salk Hall . By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the vaccine developed by Salk and his researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by 95 percent. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
State relations to present day
In 1966, Pitt was designated by Pennsylvania as a state-related university. As such, Pitt receives public funds ($154.3 million in fiscal year 2016) covering about 7% of its operating budget, [ 28 ] and offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents. Pitt retains independent control. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett and continued success in the 1980s with players such as Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino . In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of organ transplantation was conducted by Thomas Starzl , establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation. In 1991, chancellor Wesley Posvar retired after 24 years in office. His administration is best known for elimination of the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school's prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630 million and its endowment tripled to $257 million. [ 29 ]
Mark Nordenberg was chancellor of the university from 1995 to 2014 and led Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over three quarters of the way toward achieving its goal [ 30 ] and a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan. [ 31 ] Major initiatives and events that have occurred during his tenure include the construction of the Petersen Events Center , a major expansion of on-campus housing, the growth of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the restructuring of its relationship with the university, and a series of disruptive bomb threats that occurred in 2012.
Patrick D. Gallagher was named the 18th chancellor of the university and assumed the office on August 1, 2014. [ 32 ]
The University of Pittsburgh's main campus comprises approximately 132 urban acres (0.53 km 2 ) located in Pittsburgh's historic Oakland neighborhood. Much of the campus, including its centerpiece 42-story Cathedral of Learning , falls within the Oakland Civic Center/Schenley Farms National Historic District . [ 33 ] contains an eclectic mix of architecture that includes Greek revival, Neogothic, Italian Renaissance, and modern. [ citation needed ] It has been termed "a theme park of replica buildings, representing the architecture of the past speaking to the present." [ 34 ]
The University of Pittsburgh's main campus contains four contiguous sections: upper (sports complexes, residence halls ); mid ( Benedum , Chevron , Allen and Thaw Halls ); lower ( Cathedral of Learning , Union , Posvar Hall ); and on the west end of campus, the medical center complex . The campus is bordered by Darragh Street/McKee Place to the west and Bellefield Avenue/Dithridge Street to the east; Forbes and Fifth avenues traverse the campus from west to east. Although generally within walking distance, the university also runs a bus and shuttle service between various campus locations and bordering neighborhoods. [ 35 ]
The main campus is within walking distance of many recreational, cultural, and educational institutions in the Oakland neighborhood. The campus is adjacent to Schenley Plaza , the main branch of the Carnegie Public Library , the Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art and the Carnegie Music Hall, as well as portions of Carnegie Mellon University . Carlow University is just west of campus, adjacent to the university's medical center complexes. The main quad of Carnegie Mellon University , Central Catholic High School , and historic Schenley Park , site of the Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens , lie across Junction Hollow on the east end.
Four Pitt buildings are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places : Allegheny Observatory (in Pittsburgh's Riverview Park on the Northside ), the Cathedral of Learning , [ 36 ] the Pittsburgh Athletic Association building, and the Ford Motor building . Twenty-one of Pitt's buildings (including the 5 residence halls that make up Schenley Quadrangle , see below) are contributing properties to the Schenley Farms-Oakland Civic Center Historic District that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district . [ 33 ]
Due to the historical nature of various sites around Pitt's buildings, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has placed historical markers outside the Allegheny Observatory , [ 37 ] Posvar Hall , [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Salk Hall , [ 40 ] Stephen Foster Memorial , [ 41 ] and the William Pitt Union . [ 42 ] In addition, a Pennsylvania Historical Marker has been placed on campus near the Cathedral of Learning to mark the significance of the University of Pittsburgh itself. [ 43 ]
In addition, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation has designated the following Pitt buildings as Pittsburgh Historic Landmarks: Allegheny Observatory , Allen Hall , Alumni Hall , Bellefield Hall , Chancellor's Residence , Cathedral of Learning , the Cathedral of Learning interior rooms , Gardner Steel Conference Center , Heinz Memorial Chapel , Thaw Hall , Salk Hall , Schenley Quadrangle residence halls , Stephen Foster Memorial , the University Child Development Center , and the William Pitt Union . [ 44 ] [ 45 ]
Other Pitt buildings not designated individually as landmarks, but listed among the 16 Pitt-owned contributing properties to the Schenley Farms Historic District, include Clapp Hall , O'Hara Student Center , Ruskin Hall , Thackeray Hall , Frick Fine Arts Building , Music Building , and the University Club . [ 46 ]
Historic structures within, adjacent to, or near Pitt's campus, but not belonging to the university, include the Carnegie Museum buildings , Frick School , Forbes Field wall remnant, Magee Estate iron fence, the Schenley Fountain , Mellon Institute , Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens , the Pittsburgh Athletic Association , St. Paul's Cathedral , St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Schenley High School , Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall – where scenes of The Silence of the Lambs were filmed in 1990, and the Stephen Foster sculpture . Many of these buildings and their facilities are integrated into the events and activities of the university. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
The majority of Pitt-owned facilities are clustered in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh which includes the Schenley Farms Historic District , however a few prominent facilities are scattered elsewhere throughout the city, including the adjacent Shadyside neighborhood. Pitt also maintains regional Pennsylvania campuses in Bradford , Greensburg , Johnstown , and Titusville , as well as a Computer Center in RIDC Park in Blawnox , the Plum Boro Science Center in Plum , the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center (U-PARC) in Harmarville , and the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology in Linesville . [ 50 ] The university also has a major archeological research site, the Allen L. Cook Spring Creek Preserve , near Rock River, Wyoming . [ 51 ] [ 52 ]
Athletic facilities of the University of Pittsburgh Panthers that are located in Oakland in the upper campus and include the Charles L Cost Sports Center , Fitzgerald Field House , the Petersen Events Center , Trees Hall and Trees Field . An approximately $30 million upgrade of on-campus sports facilities, starting with the Petersen Sports Complex , includes new soccer, baseball, softball facilities, and helps clear a space for the future construction of a new track and field and band complex. [ 53 ] Athletic facilities in Pittsburgh that are located outside of the Oakland neighborhood include Acrisure Stadium and the UPMC Sports Performance Complex . [ 54 ]
Major on-campus residence halls include the Litchfield Towers , Schenley Quadrangle , Forbes Hall , Bouquet Gardens and Ruskin Hall located on the lower campus, Lothrop Hall on the medical campus, and Panther , Nordenberg Hall , and Sutherland halls located on the upper campus. [ 55 ]
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is consistently ranked in U.S. News & World Report's "Honor Roll" of America's top hospitals [ 56 ] and consists of the following hospitals and facilities in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Oakland , many of which have shared uses with various University departments: UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, UPMC Montefiore Hospital, Magee-Women's Hospital of UPMC, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Thomas Detre Hall, Eye and Ear Institute, Forbes Tower (home to the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences ), Iroquois Building, Kaufman Medical Building, Medical Arts Building, 230 McKee Place, and UPMC University Center. UPMC academic hospitals and facilities elsewhere in Pittsburgh include the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh campus in the Lawrenceville neighborhood, the UPMC Sports Performance Complex on the South Side , and the UPMC Shadyside and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute in the Hillman Cancer Center (both located in the Shadyside neighborhood adjacent to Oakland). [ 57 ]
Regional campuses allow students to take preliminary courses and relocate to other regional campuses or the Oakland campus to complete their degrees. They offer several degrees and certificates:
The University of Pittsburgh has been noted for both its role in community outreach and its impact on the economy of the city and the Western Pennsylvania region. In 2009, Pitt was ranked second overall, and the top public university in the nation, as a "Best Neighbor" for positive impact on its urban community, including both commercial and residential activities such as revitalization, cultural renewal, economics, and community service and development according to the "Saviors of Our Cities" ranking. [ 58 ] Pitt was also listed as a "best neighbor" in the previous ranking released in 2006. [ 59 ] These rankings reflect the statistics that each year Pitt spends more than $1.7 billion in the community and supports nearly 33,800 jobs in Allegheny County . The university is the Pittsburgh region's second largest non-government employer behind its affiliated University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). [ 60 ] Pitt's research program alone imports more than $822 million into the region each year (more than $3.60 for each $1 of state appropriations), and supports some 23,100 local jobs. [ 61 ] [ 14 ] [ 23 ] Pitt students also spend more than $213 million on goods, services, and rental payments within the local economy. [ 62 ] Pitt ranked sixth in the number of startups spawned by technologies developed by its researchers according to Association of University Technology Managers. [ 63 ]
Pitt and its medical school are the academic partners of the closely affiliated the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. With over 1450 employees and $1 billion annual revenue, UPMC is the largest non-government employer in Pennsylvania.
Through the Pitt Volunteer Pool, faculty and staff members donate more than 10,000 hours annually to community service projects for agencies such as the Salvation Army, Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, and Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.
Pitt is a leading producer of Peace Corps volunteers. [ 62 ] [ 65 ] According to the Peace Corps' 2008 ranking of colleges and universities, only 14 schools in the nation produced more Peace Corps volunteers. [ 66 ] Pitt's graduate school also ranked tenth for most alumni Peace Corps volunteers. [ 67 ]
The University of Pittsburgh has undertaken programs to improve sustainability initiatives and practices. Pitt started programs in ecology and established biological field stations in 1926. [ 68 ] In 1990, Pitt was one of the first 22 signatories of the Talloires Declaration . [ 69 ] In 2003, Pitt founded its Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] In 2013, Pitt released its first sustainability report [ 72 ] and in 2014 celebrated a "Year of Sustainability" [ 73 ] by launching a Student Office of Sustainability that now has over 25 affiliated student organizations. [ 74 ] In 2018, Pitt published its first comprehensive "Pitt Sustainability Plan", [ 75 ] established the Office of Sustainability, [ 76 ] and hired its first director of sustainability. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] In 2020, Pitt committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2037 (its 250th anniversary) [ 79 ] and its first climate action plan came out in 2022. [ 80 ]
Pitt received a AASHE STARS Gold rating in 2021, [ 81 ] building on its Silver rating from 2018, [ 82 ] has long been on The Princeton Review 's "Green Colleges" list, [ 83 ] been included on the Environmental Protection Agency 's Green Powered Universities list since 2018, [ 84 ] [ 85 ] won multiple Sustainable Pittsburgh Challenges, [ 86 ] and has other third-party recognitions .
In 2018, the university announced its intention to buy all of the electricity from a run-of-the-river hydro power facility to be built by Rye Development at Allegheny Lock and Dam No. 2 on the Allegheny River in 2023. [ 87 ] In 2020, the university announced a second local renewable power purchasing agreement, for solar power to be built on the border of Beaver and Allegheny counties near Pittsburgh International Airport. [ 88 ]
The university has been criticized for some of its financial investments, namely those in the fossil fuel industry. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] In 2020, a Board report disclosed that endowment exposure to fossil fuels had decreased 42% between 2015 and 2020, with zero private investments in fossil fuels by the end of 2035. [ 91 ]
Organization and administration
The university was chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1787 and it operated as a fully private institution until an alteration to its charter in 1966 at which point it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education . This conferred "state-related" status to the university making it a legal instrument of the Commonwealth which provides an annual financial appropriation, currently 7.7% of the university's total operating budget, [ 92 ] in exchange for the university offering tuition discounts to students who are residents of Pennsylvania. Legally, however, the university remains a private entity, operating under its nonprofit corporate charter, governed by its independent Board of Trustees, and with its assets under its own ownership and control. Therefore, it retains the freedom and individuality of a private institution, both administratively and academically, setting its own standards for admissions, awarding of degrees, faculty qualifications, teaching, and staff hiring. [ b ]
The university's board of trustees maintains ultimate legal authority, governance, and responsibility for the university but specifically reserves authority over selecting the university's chancellor; approval of major policies, particularly those related to the fiduciary responsibilities of the board; and the definition of the university's mission and goals. It is made up of 36 voting members: chancellor, 17 term trustees elected by the board, 6 alumni trustees elected by the board on nomination from the Alumni Association Board of directors, and 12 Commonwealth trustees. The governor of Pennsylvania , the president pro tempore of the Pennsylvania Senate , and the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives each appoints four of the 12 Commonwealth trustees. Additional non-voting trustees include 14 special trustees and additional emeritus trustees selected by the board. Non-voting ex-officio members include the governor of Pennsylvania, the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , the chief executive of Allegheny County , and the mayor of Pittsburgh . There are three or more regular meetings of the Board of Trustees per year.
The Board of Trustees selects the university's chancellor, who doubles as the chief academic officer and the chief executive of the university as well as serving as an ex officio voting member of the board of trustees. The chancellor is delegated with general administrative, academic, and management authority over the university. Under the chancellor are the provost and senior vice chancellor, the senior vice chancellor for health sciences, the deans of the various schools, the presidents of the regional campuses, department chairs, and the directors of university centers and institutes. The university is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools . [ 97 ]
Throughout its history, Pitt has been committed to a liberal arts education with a curriculum in the arts, sciences, and humanities. Pitt also has emphasized undergraduate research experience and opportunities such as co-ops and internships. [ 98 ] Undergraduate degrees can be earned as Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Philosophy. Along with providing certificate programs, graduate level master's, professional, and doctoral degrees are also awarded. Pitt has also initiated a university-wide Outside the Classroom Curriculum (OCC) that includes a structured series of extracurricular programs and experiences designed to complement students' academic studies and help develop personal attributes and professional skills. [ 99 ] Students who complete the OCC requirements receive an OCC "transcript" and a green cord of distinction to wear at commencement. [ 100 ] Pitt offers free workshops and certification programs such as a pedagogy certification badge [ 101 ] and a semester-long public education mentorship program. [ 102 ] Distinguished undergraduate programs are offered through the David C. Frederick Honors College. [ 103 ]
The freshman level entry schools include the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences , the College of Business Administration, the Swanson School of Engineering, and the School of Nursing .

^ Upon joining the Commonwealth System of Higher Education in 1966, the University of Pittsburgh legally remained a private entity and in practice, retained the administrative and academic freedom of a private institution. It sets its own standards for student admission and retention, faculty, and teaching. Its assets remain in the hands of the corporation, its employees are employed by the corporation, and its affairs are governed by an independent Board of Trustees. [ 93 ] In-state tuition is subsidized by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the state provides approximately 11% of its operating budget. [ 94 ] The University of Pittsburgh is categorized as a public university in the Carnegie Foundation Classifications [ 8 ] and is typically listed as a public university in third party publications. [ 95 ] For simplicity, Pitt sometimes refers to itself a "public university".

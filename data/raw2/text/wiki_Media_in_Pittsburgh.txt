Pittsburgh radio has long been dominated by KDKA 1020 AM. However, as of early 2006 the station is no longer No. 1 in the ratings. KQV 1410 AM, now an all-news outlet, was Pittsburgh's dominant Top 40 station throughout the 1960s. On the FM dial, album-rock WDVE (102.5 DVE), modern rock WXDX (105.9 The X), adult contemporary WBZZ (Star 100.7), pop and hip-hop WKST-FM (96.1 KissFM) and Pittsburgh Sports Talk on (93.7 The Fan) KDKA-FM FM talk radio is available in the Pittsburgh market at WPGB (104.7 FM NewsTalk). Pittsburgh is also home to three public radio stations: WESA , the local NPR station; WQED-FM , a listener-supported commercial-free classical music station; and WYEP 91.3FM, the nation's third-largest independent "adult album alternative" (AAA) station, which hosts the locally produced environmental radio show The Allegheny Front and also carries some NPR programming. The Radio Information Service , broadcasting on a subcarrier of WESA provides special programming for the blind and print impaired. Additionally, Pittsburgh hosts the non-commercial radio stations WRCT (affiliated with Carnegie Mellon University ) and WPTS (affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh ).

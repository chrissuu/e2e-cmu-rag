A cross pollination of photographs, paintings and writing, all about the NEIGHBORHOOD, what it looks like, feels like, sounds like; what memories we hold, what stories we have to tell each other. A collaborative experiment by
4 Photographers, 4 Painters and 2 Writers.  Inviting the viewer into a conversation on the diversity and texture  of Pittsburgh Neighborhoods.
We look forward to you sharing your memories with us as well as the exhibitors invite you in to the conversation.

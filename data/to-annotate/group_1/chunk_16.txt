security and baggage facilities, a new international arrivals area, and many other amenities to serve passengers. The board chairman of the Airport Authority, David Minnotte, said, "The people of Pittsburgh finally get an airport built for them and not USAir". No taxpayer dollars would be used to construct the new facility, and it will be instead financed with floating bonds, grants, passenger facility charges, and revenue from natural gas drilling on airport property. [76] Total costs have increased to $1. 7 billion. [77] Construction was originally expected to begin in summer 2020 and the new terminal was slated to open in 2023. [78] In April 2020, however, airport officials decided to delay the selling of bonds and start of construction due to the coronavirus pandemic. [79] In February 2021, airport officials announced early site and construction work would begin in spring 2021 with an increased budget of $1. 39 billion. [21][80] The airlines serving the airport agreed to fund $182 million in construction site preparation work for the project. An additional $28. 8 million in funding will come from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. [81][82][83] Construction finally began in July 2021[19] and the project is expected to be completed in October 2025. [84] Airport officials emphasized the local flair of the new terminal. Building materials were sourced locally, including the steel, and around 90% of construction workers live in the Pittsburgh region. The roof is intended to mimic the rolling hills of western Pennsylvania and the support columns are intended to resemble tree branches. The bridge and tunnel between the landside and airside terminals is intended to mirror the Fort Pitt Tunnel and Fort Pitt Bridge. An outdoor terrace will be accessible to passengers even after clearing security. [85] In preparation for the airport's projected opening in fall 2025, the airport authority held a public trial day with 300 volunteers who simulated different parts of the travel experience. [86] A gala at the new terminal to celebrate its completion with Jeff Goldblum and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is planned. [87] After the new landside terminal opens, additional renovations for the airside terminal are planned, including new carpeting and reconfiguring of the A and B concourses. [88] The airport is partly in Findlay Township, [89] and partly in Moon Township. [90] The Air Reserve Station is in Moon Township. [91] PIT has a wide, open layout and four runways: three eastâ€“west parallel runways and a fourth crosswind runway. The airport's two longest runways are 11, 500 feet (3, 510 m) and 10, 775 feet (3, 280 m), allowing PIT to accommodate the largest airliners. Because of the development of non-aviation related business on airport land, PIT can add only one more runway (this number was as high as four in the past). With three parallel runways, simultaneous landings and/or departures can be performed in nearly any situation. [92] Runways 10L and 10R have Category III ILS (Instrument Landing System) approaches. Runway 28R is certified for Category I ILS and is authorized for Category II approaches but requires special aircrew and aircraft certification. Runways 28L and 32 have Category I ILS approaches. All runways have GPS approaches as well. During westerly winds, Runway 28L serves as the primary arrival runway, while 28R serves as primary departure and secondary arrival runway. Runway 32 serves as the main arrival runway for general aviation traffic. During easterly winds, runway 10L serves as the primary arrival runway, 10R is the secondary arrival runway, while 10C is the departure runway. Due to PIT's size, location, runway length, and equipment, the airport handles a large number of diversions of flights bound for the East Coast, especially Washington, D. C. and New York, during inclement weather conditions. The airport's large runways, distance from coastal weather systems, and microgrid equip it to handle even the largest international aircraft. [93] In recent years, Pittsburgh has handled several hundred diversions annually, with a record of 463 in 2018. [94] The airport complex consists of two main buildings, the "Landside Terminal" and the "Airside Terminal". The terminal consists of 75 gates on four concourses; only 56 gates are available for use. [95] After passing through the security checkpoint, passengers board one of two underground people movers that travel to the Airside Terminal, where all departure gates are located. All international arrivals, except for cities with United States border preclearance, pass through Concourse C. American Airlines has an Admirals Club on the mezzanine level of the airside terminal. [96] The Club Lounge opened in October 2017 in the C Concourse across from gate C-52 near the center core[97] and was renovated and expanded in 2019. [98] The airport also operates a free lounge for active duty military and veterans in concourse C. There is an AirMall in the airside terminal, operated by Fraport, with numerous retail stores and restaurants. It was one of the first of its kind in an airport and paved the way for similar shopping experiences at other airports. Tenants in the airport are required to charge the same amount as they do at non-airport locations. Before 9/11, anyone could shop in the airport, but it was closed to non-travelers after 9/11. In 2017, the AirMall was reopened to non-travelers who obtained a free access pass from the airport, but this access is temporarily suspended. [99] PIT is located at Exit 53 of Interstate 376 and the Western Terminus Pennsylvania Route 576 (future I-576), and within 10 miles (20 km) of Interstate 79 and 15 miles (24 km) of Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Interstate 70 to the south and Interstate 80 to the north are both less than an hour away. Just beyond Interstates 70 and 80, Interstate 77 to the west and Interstate 68 to the south are within 90 minutes of the airport. PIT offers on-site parking patrolled by the Allegheny County Police. The local Grant Oliver Corporation ran the parking from the airport's opening in 1952 until the Allegheny County Airport Authority chose to switch to national contractor LAZ Parking, which took over in October 2022 and will also oversee new facilities planned to open in 2024. Grant Oliver offered a GO FAST Pass account to pay for parking electronically via E-ZPass. This system was renamed to PIT Express Pass by LAZ. LAZ also offers online parking reservations. [100][101][102][103] There are regular parking shuttles to the Long Term and Extended lots that can be accessed from the Baggage Claim level of the Landside Terminal. [104] There are four options for parking: Short Term, Long Term, Extended, and Economy. The economy option was added in 2021. [105] The short term garage has 2100 spaces and is attached to the landside terminal via the enclosed moving walkway. The long term section is also connected to the enclosed moving walkway and has 3, 100 spaces available. The extended and economy sections have an outdoor walkway that leads to the enclosed moving walkway and have 8, 000 spaces available. [104] Bus service is also available from Downtown Pittsburgh and the city's University District (Oakland) via the Port Authority of Allegheny County's 28X Route. Mountain Line Transit's Grey Line also has service to areas south of Pittsburgh including Waynesburg, Pennsylvania; Morgantown,

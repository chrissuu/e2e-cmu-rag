$100 billion in revenue via Israeli weapons contracts from 2009 through 2022, in the
years leading up to the Gaza war. [102] In 2023, it was reported that Boeing sent
1, 000 small diameter "smart" bombs for the first week of Israeli air attacks on Gaza,
which were shipped from a US Air Force base by Israeli Air Force. [103] During the
Gaza war, Boeing's stock prices soared due to additional Israeli weapons contracts,
[104] while mass demonstrations sought to interrupt defense supplier summits and block
shipments of weapons for the Israel Defense Forces at Boeing facilities in St. Charles,
Missouri, [105] Tukwila, Washington, [106] and Gresham, Oregon, [107] due to the mass
violations of International humanitarian law committed by Israel. [108][109][110]
Students at Florida State University, [111] University of Washington, [112] Saint
Louis University, University of Missouriâ€“St. Louis, and Washington University in St.
Louis[113] called for their institutions to break partnerships with Boeing. In 2024,
students on hunger strike at Brown University named Boeing among the list of corporations
to divest from. [114] Five protestors, in opposition to Boeing sales to Israel, were
arrested on felony charges after blocking entrances to a Boeing facility in Heath,
Ohio. [115] The student union at Washington University in St. Louis passed a resolution
calling on the university to divest from Boeing. [116] Israel has used the Boeing
manufactured GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb during the Gaza war, including in bombings
of a Rafah refugee tent camp, [117] the Al-Sardi school, [118] and the Al-Tabaeen
school. [119] The key trends of Boeing are (as at the financial year ending December
31): [120] Between 2010 and 2018, Boeing increased its operating cash flow from $3
to $15. 3 billion, sustaining its share price, by negotiating advance payments from
customers and delaying payments to its suppliers. This strategy is sustainable only
as long as orders are good and delivery rates are increasing. [141] From 2013 to 2019,
Boeing spent over $60 billion on dividends and stock buybacks, twice as much as the
development costs of the 787. [142] In 2020, Boeing's second quarter revenue was $11.
8 billion as a result of the pandemic slump. Due to higher sales in other divisions
and an influx in deliveries of commercial jetliners in 2021, second quarter revenue
increased by 44%, reaching nearly $17 billion. [143] Revenues decreased 15 percent
to $16. 9 billion in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the same time period
in 2023. [144] The company's operating loss amounted to $1. 39 billion and its net
loss to $1. 43 billion, while plane deliveries fell to 92 (from 136 in 2023). In 2024,
Boeing delivered just 348 aircraft to its customers, its lowest output since the COVID-19
pandemic. [clarification needed] Boeing ended the year with a backlog of 5, 595 unfilled
orders. [145] The company's employment totals are listed below. Approximately 1. 5%
of Boeing employees are in the Technical Fellowship program, a program through which

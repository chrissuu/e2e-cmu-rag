Chancellor Albert Bowker, the Board of Higher Education (BHE) approved an open admissions
plan in 1966, but it was not scheduled to be fully implemented until 1975. [57] In
1969, students and faculty across CUNY participated in rallies, student strikes, and
class boycotts demanding an end to CUNY's restrictive admissions policies. CUNY administrators
and Mayor John Lindsay expressed support for these demands, and the BHE voted to implement
the plan immediately in the fall of 1970. [57] All high school graduates were guaranteed
entrance to the university without having to fulfill traditional requirements such
as exams or grades. The policy nearly doubled the number of students enrolled in the
CUNY system to 35, 000 (compared to 20, 000 the year before). Black and Hispanic student
enrollment increased threefold. [85] Remedial education, to supplement the training
of under-prepared students, became a significant part of CUNY's offerings. [86] Additionally,
ethnic and Black Studies programs and centers were instituted on many CUNY campuses,
contributing to the growth of similar programs nationwide. [57] Retention of students
in CUNY during this period was low; two-thirds of students enrolled in the early 1970s
left within four years without graduating. [57] In 1970, LaGuardia Community College
was founded in Long Island City, Queens. Like many college campuses in 1970, CUNY
faced a number of protests and demonstrations after the Kent State massacre and Cambodian
Campaign. The Administrative Council of the City University of New York sent U. S.
president Richard Nixon a telegram in 1970 stating, "No nation can long endure the
alienation of the best of its young people. "[87] Some colleges, including John Jay
College of Criminal Justice, historically the "college for cops, " held teach-ins
in addition to student and faculty protests. [88] In fall 1976, during New York City's
fiscal crisis, the free tuition policy was discontinued under pressure from the federal
government, the financial community that had a role in rescuing the city from bankruptcy,
and New York State, which would take over the funding of CUNY's senior colleges. [89]
Tuition, which had been in place in the State University of New York system since
1963, was instituted at all CUNY colleges. [90][91] Meanwhile, CUNY students were
added to the state's need-based Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), which had been created
to help private colleges. [92] Full-time students who met the income eligibility criteria
were permitted to receive TAP, ensuring for the first time that financial hardship
would deprive no CUNY student of a college education. [92] Within a few years, the
federal government would create its own need-based program, known as Pell Grants,
providing the neediest students with a tuition-free college education. In 1981 Charles
Halpern, a founder of one of the nation's first public interest law firms, was hired
by CUNY as the founding dean of a planned law school. [93] CUNY School of Law opened
in 1983 as The CUNY Law School at Queens College. [94] The goal of CUNY Law was to

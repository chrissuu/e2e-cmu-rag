States; 31. 3% of households had an annual income of $200, 000 or more. [224] Arlington's wealth is not equally distributed geographically or by racial background and tends to be concentrated in its wealthier northern neighborhoods that have a higher share of white households. Arlington's southern areas, which have greater racial and ethnic diversity and a higher population of immigrant families, have lower incomes and higher levels of poverty. [225] This has been attributed to the county's historical underinvestment in the infrastructure and economy of southern Arlington, which is the location of several of Arlington's formerly segregated, historically black neighborhoods. [226] Overall, 7. 3% of Arlington residents were below the national poverty level in 2023. [224] Arlington had an estimated total of 126, 540 housing units in 2025, representing 6. 3% growth since 2020. 73% of its housing supply consists of multifamily apartments or condos. [227] More than 38% of homes in Arlington are valued at $1 million or more, and the home ownership rate stands at 41. 1%. [228] The average rent in 2024 was $2, 549; [227] Arlington was identified as one of the most expensive rental markets in the United States outside of California by several real estate firms in 2025. [229] About 8. 9% of Arlington's total housing supply consisted of affordable housing units in 2025. [227] Homelessness in Arlington has been trending upwards since 2021; as of 2025, there were 271 homeless individuals, which represented a 12% increase from 2024. [230] According to a 2024 report by the county government, Arlington County attracted 7. 1 million visitors in 2023, who generated $6. 5 billion in economic activity from a total of $4. 5 billion in spending. [231] This activity, which is inclusive of spending at the county's travel centers like Ronald Reagan National Airport, supported 27, 567 jobs and is representative of a broader recovery since the COVID-19 pandemic. [231][232] Employment in tourism and hospitality also increased during this period, but has yet to reach parity with pre-pandemic levels. [233] Arlington County is within the Northern Virginia region, which has been described as being greatly influenced by its proximity to Washington and its employment opportunities in the federal government; this has attracted highly educated, affluent migrants from other states and countries, ultimately rendering the culture more international and northern in character relative to Virginia's southern regions. [234][235] Consequently, Arlington has communities and enclaves of various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The Columbia Pike corridor, which has been a destination for immigrants since Southeast Asians began arriving after the Fall of Saigon in the 1970s, [236] exemplifies this, and is today home to residents from over 150 different nationalities; it has become particularly known for its wide variety of international food options and venues. [237] Arlington is home to Arlington National Cemetery and several prominent military and civilian memorials, including the Air Force Memorial, Marine Corps War Memorial, and the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial. Arlington National Cemetery attracts more than 3 million visitors annually, [238] with many coming to observe memorials like the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which is guarded all year by the U. S. Army 3rd Infantry, the John F Kennedy Gravesite, which memorializes former president John F Kennedy with an eternal flame, and the Military Women's Memorial, which honors all women that have served in the U. S. Armed Forces. Others visit Arlington National Cemetery to pay respects to or grieve for deceased soldiers and relatives; more than 400, 000 members of the U. S. Armed Forces are buried in the cemetery. [239] The cemetery offers interpretive group tours and tour bus services to its main memorials. [240] In addition, the National Park Service operates a museum in the historic Arlington House about the history of the Custis plantation, the estate's enslaved laborers and servants, and the life of Robert E. Lee. [241] Local museums in Arlington include the Arlington Historical Museum, which is located in the 1891 Hume School and run by the Arlington Historical Society, [242] the Black Heritage Museum of Arlington, which details the history of Arlington's black community, [243] and the Museum of Contemporary Art Arlington, which is hosted in the historic Clarendon School building and is one of the largest non-federal contemporary art venues in the Washington metropolitan area. [244] Arlington hosts a variety of events every year pertaining to culture and the arts, such as the Arlington County Fair, which was first held in 1977 as an event for local gardening clubs, [245] music festivals such as the Columbia Pike Blues Festival and Rosslyn Jazz Festival, [246][247] and summertime concerts held at the Lubber Run Amphitheater. [248] Major sporting events include the Marine Corps Marathon, whose course has run through Arlington every fall since 1976, [249] and the Armed Forces Association Cycling Classic, a summer road bicycle race which has been held in Arlington's Crystal City and Clarendon neighborhoods since 1998. [250] Since 1930, [261] Arlington County has been governed by a board of supervisors that appoint a County Manager, the latter of which oversees the county's everyday operations, as well as its departments and offices that provide administrative and regulatory services. [262] Each of the board's five members are elected at-large and serving staggered 4-year terms. [263] Since 2023, primary elections for county board seats have been conducted via ranked choice voting. [264] Board members elect a chair, who serves as the official head of county government, and vice-chair at annual organizational meetings held every January. [263] The elected board chair and vice-chair share the same duties and responsibilities of their peers, and do not possess the power to veto motions. [263] The board oversees various elements of county administration, including general policy, land use and zoning, tax rates, the issuance of proclamations, and the making of appointments to citizen advisory groups. [263] The board also represents Arlington County at regional, state, and national forums and commissions. [263] Other elected county officials include the school board and five constitutional officers, which consist of the County Clerk of the Circuit Court, Commissioner of the Revenue, Commonwealth's Attorney, Sheriff, and Treasurer. [265] In Virginia's General Assembly, Arlington County is represented by three members of the House of Delegates from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Districts, and two members of the Senate from Districts 39 and 40. [271] Members of the House of Delegates and Senate serve two-year and four-year terms, respectively. [271] In the lower chamber of the U. S. Congress, Arlington is part of Virginia's 8th congressional district of the House of Representatives, which is represented by a single Representative elected every two years. Don Beyer, a Democrat, has served in this position since 2015. [272] Virginia's two members in the Senate are elected on six-year terms. [271] These positions have been occupied by Democratic Senators Mark Warner since 2009 and Tim Kaine since 2013. [273][274] Historically a conservative Southern Democratic constituency, Arlington County has been liberal Democratic stronghold since the 1980s; a Republican candidate has not won Arlington in state or federal elections since 1981. [276] The Democratic Party has also mostly held Arlington's local elected offices over the last several decades; the election of John Vihstadt, a Republican who ran as an independent, to the

Pake began writing two different books, both with the collaborator Andrew Szanton.
Pake's death, of heart failure on March 4, 2004, in Tucson, Arizona, interrupted both

Institute for recognition of his leadership in the field of technology and innovation.
Pake was also a recipient of the National Medal of Science in 1987 and continued to
visit PARC long after his 1986 retirement from Xerox. Since 1984, the American Physical

to recognize outstanding work by physicists combining original research accomplishments
with leadership in the management of research or development in industry. [8] Pake

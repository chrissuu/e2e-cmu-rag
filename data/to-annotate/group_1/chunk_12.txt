atrocities, including . .. its support for the crackdown in Hong Kong. "[180] According
to The Guardian, the Post had already stopped running "China Watch" in 2019. [181]
In March 2022, reporter Paul Farhi was suspended for five days without pay after he
tweeted about the publication's policy on bylines and datelines regarding Russian-based
stories. [182] In 2020, The Post suspended reporter Felicia Sonmez after she posted
a series of tweets about the 2003 rape allegation against basketball star Kobe Bryant
after Bryant's death. She was reinstated after over 200 Post journalists wrote an
open letter criticizing the paper's decision. [183] In July 2021, Sonmez sued The
Post and several of its top editors, alleging workplace discrimination; the suit was
dismissed in March 2022, with the court determining that Sonmez had failed to make
plausible claims. [184] In June 2022, Sonmez engaged in a Twitter feud with fellow
Post staffers David Weigel, criticizing him over what he later described as "an offensive
joke", and Jose A. Del Real, who accused Sonmez of "engaging in repeated and targeted
public harassment of a colleague". [185] Following the feud, the newspaper suspended
Weigel for a month for violating the company's social media guidelines, and the newspaper's
executive editor Sally Buzbee sent out a newsroom-wide memorandum directing employees
to "Be constructive and collegial" in their interactions with colleagues. [185] The
newspaper fired Sonmez, writing in an emailed termination letter that she had engaged
in "misconduct that includes insubordination, maligning your co-workers online and
violating The Post's standards on workplace collegiality and inclusivity. "[186] The
Post faced criticism from the Post Guild after refusing to go to arbitration over
the dismissal, stating that the expiration of the Post's contract "does not relieve
the Post from its contractual obligation to arbitrate grievances filed prior to expiration.
"[182] In 2019, Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann filed a defamation
lawsuit against the Post, alleging that it libeled him in seven articles regarding
the January 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation between Covington students and the
Indigenous Peoples March. [187][188] A federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that
30 of the 33 statements in the Post that Sandmann alleged were libelous were not,
but allowed Sandmann to file an amended complaint as to three statements. [189] After
Sandmann's lawyers amended the complaint, the suit was reopened on October 28, 2019.
[190][191] In 2020, The Post settled the lawsuit brought by Sandmann for an undisclosed
amount. [192] Several Washington Post op-eds and columns have prompted criticism,
including a number of comments on race by columnist Richard Cohen over the years,
[193][194] and a controversial 2014 column on campus sexual assault by George Will.
[195][196] The Post's decision to run an op-ed by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a leader
in Yemen's Houthi movement, was criticized by some activists on the basis that it
provided a platform to an "anti-Western and antisemitic group supported by Iran. "[197]

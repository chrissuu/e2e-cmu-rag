education did not pass into the university sector until the 1980s. The former Claremont
campus is on land between Goldsworthy, Princess and Bay Roads in the western Perth
suburb of Claremont. [33] It is a large two storey limestone building set in extensive
grounds, with a distinctive square crenellated tower, and was entered in the Register
of the National Estate in 1987. [34] Over time, other teacher training colleges were
formed, including Graylands Teachers College (GTC) in 1955, the Western Australian
Secondary Teachers College (WASTC) in 1967 that was renamed Nedlands College of Advanced
Education (NCAE) on 1 January 1979, Mount Lawley Teachers College (MLTC) in 1970 and
Churchlands Teachers College in 1972. [35] The Graylands Teachers College in 1977
was recommended by the Commonwealth Government for closure at the end of 1979, to
be merged into Churchlands, Mount Lawley and Claremont. [31][36] On 11 December 1981,
the Claremont Teachers College, Nedlands College of Advanced Education, Mount Lawley
College of Advanced Education and Churchlands College of Advanced Education amalgamated
to form the Western Australian College of Advanced Education (WACAE, or colloquially
wacky), [37]: 1 with campuses in Churchlands, Claremont, Mount Lawley and Nedlands.
[37]: 13 A new Bunbury campus started taking in students in 1986, [37]: 14 and a new
Joondalup campus in 1987. [38]: 2 During the 1980s, Western Australia's first nursing
education program was also established. [31] The Claremont Teachers College's last
Director was Thomas Ryan (1924â€“2002), who completed his teacher training at the College
and graduated in 1947. He was appointed Vice-Principal of the College in 1972, a position
he held until his appointment as Director of the College in 1980. [39] In 1989, WACAE
underwent an independent review led by the former University of Melbourne vice chancellor
David Caro in the form of the Caro Committee, which included Roy Lourens who later
became vice chancellor of Edith Cowan University. [31] One of the earlier proposals
in the late 1980s for the name of the institution was Perth University. [40] WACAE
was granted university status on 1 January 1991[41] and changed its name to Edith
Cowan University after Edith Dircksey Cowan, the first woman to be elected to an Australian
Parliament. [42] As of 2025[update], Edith Cowan University is the only Australian
university named after a woman. Cowan worked to raise funds for students to attend
universities in other states, prior to a university being built in Western Australia,
obtaining government support for her scheme. [43] Her work in this area was acknowledged
by naming Western Australia's oldest tertiary education institution and newest university
after her, as well as her image being added to the 1995 and 2018 designs (the polymer
designs) of the Australian $50 note. [43] Cowan believed that education was the key
to growth, change and improvement and her contribution to the development of Western
Australian education was significant. She strove to achieve social justice and campaigned
for the rights of women, children and families, for the poor, the poorly educated

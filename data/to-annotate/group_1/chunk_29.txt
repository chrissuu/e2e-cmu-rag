has within its city limits the Sweetwater Marsh unit of the San Diego Bay NWR. [101] It also maintains several city maintained open space areas. [102] The original Chula Vista encompasses the area west of Hilltop Drive and north of L Street. [10] The community of Montgomery was annexed by the city, after several failed attempts, in 1986; [64] The community consists of most of the area south of L Street, west of Hilltop Drive and north of San Diego's city limit. [10] Unlike East Chula Vista, West Chula Vista does not have Mello-Roos, which has been suggested to have led to those not living in West Chula Vista to develop a separate civic identity. [103] Beginning in the late 1980s the planned communities of Eastlake, Otay Ranch, Millenia, and Rancho del Rey began to develop in the annexed areas east of Interstate 805 and California State Route 125. These communities expanded upon the eastern annexations of the 1970s, including the area around Southwestern College. [10] In 1986, Eastlake began to be built. [21] In 1989, Rancho del Rey was established. [104] In 1999, Otay Ranch began to be built on 23, 000 acres (93 km2). [105] Although "Eastlake" properly refers only to one planned community in east Chula Vista built around an artificial pond, the name is often used to encompass a much broader suburban region along the SR 125 corridor. [106] This is in part due to the misconception that the lake which the name "Eastlake" refers to is the much larger Lower Otay Reservoir. [citation needed] Many businesses and institutions throughout east Chula Vista use "Eastlake" in their names. [citation needed] In the years around 2008 thousands of Tijuana's elite bought houses in and moved to east Chula Vista escaping violence, kidnapping and other crime taking place during that period in the Mexican metropolis only a few miles away. The Los Angeles Times wrote, "So many upper-class Mexican families live in… Eastlake… and Bonita… that… the area is becoming a gilded colony of Mexicans, where speaking English is optional and people can breathe easy cruising around in their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs. "[107] In late 2018, a new Rapid bus route was created, taking passengers from the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, through eastern Chula Vista, and then into downtown San Diego. [108] Like the rest of lowland San Diego County, Chula Vista has a semi-arid climate (BSk), with mediterranean characteristics, though the winter rainfall is too low and erratic to qualify as an actual Mediterranean climate. [109] With a moderate climate where the annual averages seldom oscillate much, there has still been a 103 °F (39 °C) high and a 24 °F (−4 °C) low recorded since the station's inception in 1918. [110] In 1949, the maximum daytime temperature was just 44 °F (7 °C) once, the lowest on record. [110] Thanks to the maritime moderation, on average the coldest day is at a very mild 57 °F (14 °C). [110] Summer nights are warmer than in coastal climates further north, but cooler than in the hot interior. The warmest low on record is 78 °F (26 °C) in 2016, while the warmest average night between 1991 and 2020 stood at 72 °F (22 °C).

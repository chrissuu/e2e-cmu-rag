building Hope College (1821–22) and Manning Hall (1834–35). In 1904, the John Carter
Brown Library was established as an independently funded research library on Brown's
campus; the library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown, son of
Nicholas Brown Jr. The Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode
Island, and accrued wealth both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave
trade. The family was divided on the issue of slavery. John Brown had defended slavery,
while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent abolitionists. In 2003, under the
tenure of President Ruth Simmons, the university established a steering committee
to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to
address them. [40] With British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay in the fall of
1776, the college library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping. During the
subsequent American Revolutionary War, Brown's University Hall was used to house French
and other revolutionary troops led by General George Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau
as they waited to commence the march of 1781 that led to the Siege of Yorktown and
the Battle of the Chesapeake. This has been celebrated as marking the defeat of the
British and the end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital from
December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June
26, 1780, to May 27, 1782. [13] A number of Brown's founders and alumni played roles
in the American Revolution and subsequent founding of the United States. Brown's first
chancellor, Stephen Hopkins, served as a delegate to the Colonial Congress in Albany
in 1754, and to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. James Manning represented
Rhode Island at the Congress of the Confederation, while concurrently serving as Brown's
first president. [41] Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins
signed the Declaration of Independence. James Mitchell Varnum, who graduated from
Brown with honors in 1769, served as one of General George Washington's Continental
Army brigadier generals and later as major general in command of the entire Rhode
Island militia. Varnum is noted as the founder and commander of the 1st Rhode Island
Regiment, widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U. S. military history.
[42] David Howell, who graduated with an A. M. in 1769, served as a delegate to the
Continental Congress from 1782 to 1785. Nineteen individuals have served as presidents
of the university since its founding in 1764. Since 2012, Christina Hull Paxson has
served as president. Paxson had previously served as dean of Princeton University's
School of Public and International Affairs and chair of Princeton's economics department.
[43] Paxson's immediate predecessor, Ruth Simmons, is noted as the first African American
president of an Ivy League institution. [44] Other presidents of note include academic,
Vartan Gregorian; and philosopher and economist, Francis Wayland. In 1966, the first
Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown was formed, involving 80 students

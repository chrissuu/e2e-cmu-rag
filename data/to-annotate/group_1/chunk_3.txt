was helping the people of Cuba by sending $2 billion in family remittances and $352
million in agricultural, medical, and humanitarian products in 2011. He also noted
that the Cuban government committed more than 4, 000 “short-term, politically motivated
detentions” in 2011, a number that was then surpassed in 2012. In 2013 the United
Nations passed a resolution condemning the embargo for the 22nd consecutive year.
The vote was 188–2, with only Israel supporting the U. S. policy. [13] [58] [88] Raúl
Castro, who had been in power since 2008, announced on Feb. 2013 that he would step
down in 2018. Some hoped that a new regime would make the reforms necessary to repeal
the blockade, while others looked for President Obama to end the embargo regardless
of Cuba’s actions. [89] On Dec. 17, 2014, President Obama announced a restoration
of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961. A deal between
the United States and Cuba was brokered during 18 months of secret talks hosted by
Canada, with a final meeting hosted by Pope Francis at the Vatican . Although the

in Havana on Aug. 14, 2015. Kerry stated, “We are all aware that, notwithstanding

[185] The main highways in Doha include Dukhan Highway connecting to Dukhan; [186] the 95. 2 kilometres (59. 2 mi) Al Shamal Road connecting the Doha Metropolitan Area to the northern region of Al Shamal; [187] the 33 kilometres (21 mi) Al Khor Coastal Road connecting to Al Khor, [188] the 95 kilometres (59 mi) Salwa Road connecting to the Saudi Arabian border; [189] the 195 kilometres (121 mi) Al Majd Road which is the longest highway in Qatar; [190] the 5. 5 kilometres (3. 4 mi) Lusail Expressway connecting to Lusail; [191] the 8. 7 kilometres (5. 4 mi) F-Ring Road linking Rawdat Al Khail Street to Al Matar Street; [192] the 22 kilometres (14 mi) G-Ring Road connecting Hamad International Airport to the south of the Industrial Area; [193] and the Industrial Area Road, a 12. 5-kilometer dual carriageway positioned south of the Doha Industrial Area.

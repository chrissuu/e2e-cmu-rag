program and promising more transparency and tighter policies regarding targeted killings.
Obama stated that the United States would take military action only against a “continuing
and imminent threat to the American people. ” [10] On Oct. 15, 2015, the “Drone Papers,
” a collection of classified documents about the U. S. drone program were released
by an anonymous whistleblower. Among the revelations were that up to 90 percent of
all U. S. drone killings in a five-month period were not of the intended targets,
and that unintended deaths from strikes were classified as “enemies killed in action”
regardless of whether the casualties were civilians or combatants. [120] [121] [122]
[132] [133] On July 1, 2016, Obama issued an executive order with the goal of making
the drones program more transparent. Among the polices were measures to reduce civilian
casualties, acknowledgment of civilians killed in strikes, and an annual report on
the number of strikes outside active hostilities, the number of casualties broken
down by combatants and noncombatants, and reasons for discrepancies between governmental
and nongovernmental organizations’ casualty counts. [134] [135] Donald Trump Administration
President Donald Trump revoked the July 1, 2016, executive order in 2019, stating
“This action eliminates superfluous reporting requirements, requirements that do not
improve government transparency, but rather distract our intelligence professionals
from their primary mission. ” Rights groups and lawmakers decried the enhanced secrecy
and apparent lack of accountability. [136] In July 2020 the Trump administration also
loosened rules on exporting military armed drones to foreign nations, a practice that
was previously de facto banned. [138] In the first two years of the Trump administration,
there were 2, 243 drone strikes, compared with 1, 878 in the eight years of the Obama
administration, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Airwars reported
40 airstrikes in Somalia between Jan. 1, 2020 and May 18, 2020, compared with 41 airstrikes
in Somalia from 2007 to 2016. [136] [137] A Jan. 23, 2020 poll, after the Jan. 3 drone
strikes that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani , found that 35%
of Americans agreed that drone strikes were a “very effective way to achieve US foreign
policy, ” an increase from 23% in 2015. Fewer people believed that signing international
agreements (29%), imposing sanctions (23%), or launching military interventions (17%)
were very effective. Meanwhile, 47% supported President Trump’s decision to order
the strikes that killed Soleimani and others. [140] [141] Joe Biden Administration
In October 2022 the administration of President Joe Biden tightened rules for drone
strikes, including requiring that drone operators get permission from Biden himself
to “target a suspected militant outside a conventional war zone” and requiring that
operators “have ‘near certainty’ at the moment of any strike that civilians will not
be injured. ” Strikes were also limited to operations in which capture by a commando
raid was not feasible. Targets who were American triggered more-extensive reviews.

provinces, Đà Nẵng received a score of 68. 79, marking a slight improvement from its 2022 score of 68. 52. In 2023, the province achieved its highest scores in the criteria of ‘Informal Charges’ and ‘Law and Order, ’ while receiving its lowest scores in ‘Policy Bias’ and ‘Access to Land. ’[51] Exports increased to US$575 million in 2008, but fell back to US$475 million in 2009. [50] Despite its status as a city, 37, 800 people in Da Nang were employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing as of 2007, producing 45, 000t of rice and 41, 000t of fish. [52] However, employment in these sectors had a clear negative trend in the first decade of the 21st century. [52] Gross output has also been decreasing during the second half of the decade. [50] Given Da Nang's lack of agricultural land (9200ha as of 2007) and its location at the coast, fishing has been contributing more to the economy than agriculture, with a gross output more than twice that of agriculture. [52] Da Nang Hi-Tech Park (DHTP), established in 2010, is one of Vietnam’s three national hi-tech parks. It focuses on biotechnology, microelectronics, automation, renewable energy, IT, and environmental technology. [53] The park features specialized zones for manufacturing, research, logistics, and residential areas. With modern infrastructure, tax incentives, and a strategic location, DHTP aims to be a hub for innovation and high-tech industries in central Vietnam. Da Nang is a diversified industrial center, including industries such as machinery, electrics, chemicals, shipbuilding, and textiles. [54] Specific industrial products include aquatic products, fabric, clothes, bricks, fertilizer, cement, soap, paper, and medical tablets. [52] The city's industry may diversify further. EADS is planning to set up an industrial park focused on the aviation industry in Da Nang. [55] As of 2007, Da Nang industry was dominated by the state sector, which made up 57% of gross output. This is about the same as its share in 2000. [52] Over 80% of the state industry is centrally managed (in other words: belongs to state corporations headquartered in Hanoi). [52] Almost half of the rest is contributed by the foreign-invested sector, while the private domestic sector is still relatively small and has not been able to significantly increase its share compared to the state sector. Industry grew by an average of 14. 8% per year from 2000 to 2007, making it the main engine of economic growth. However, it has the second lowest industrial growth rate in the South Central Coast (behind only Khanh Hoa Province). Employment has grown at an average of 5. 75%, reaching 118, 900 in 2007. [49] Historically, Da Nang's main marketplace has been the Hàn Market (Vietnamese: Chợ Hàn), which is downtown near the west bank of the Hàn River, between Tran Phu and Bach Dang Streets. This market, much like Ben Thanh Market in Saigon, offers a wide variety of goods sold by many different vendors, such as clothing, silk, jewelry, flowers, foodstuffs such as dried fruit and fish, as well as coffee, tea and wine (including Vietnamese snake wine). [citation needed] Many new construction projects are underway in Da Nang, including several beachfront resorts such as the US$130 million Hyatt Regency Danang Resort & Spa, and the Beach Resort complex (including Ocean Villas and Marriott Hotel) in Ngu Hanh Son. [56] Another ambitious project, the US$250 million Da Phuoc International New Town aims to construct an entirely new urban area on reclaimed land on the city's north sea coast, making it the first major land reclamation project in Central Vietnam. Plans for the Đa Phước project include the erection of a hotel and several smaller resorts, a 33-story apartment block and 60-story office block, an 18-hole golf course, a marina, as well as villas and international schools. [57][58] The tourism sector is a vital component of Da Nang's economy. Its status as a transportation hub for central Vietnam and its proximity to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Imperial City of Hue, the Old Town of Hoi An, and the My Son ruins fuels much of its tourist activity. Mỹ Sơn is an archaeological site dating back more than a thousand years, in Quang Nam. Located in a remote forested valley some 70 km west of Da Nang, this former capital and religious center of the Champa kingdom once contained in excess of 70 style temples and stupas. Although badly damaged by bombing raids in the 1960s, the site still has more than 20 structures and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. Many statues, sculptures and reliefs recovered from Mỹ Sơn are kept in the Museum of Cham Sculpture, near the Hàn River in the heart of Da Nang. Dating from the fourth to the 14th centuries, the sensual artwork on these works depicts daily activities as well as Hindu and Buddhist religious themes. The Marble Mountains are rocky limestone outcrops jutting out of the beach just south of Da Nang. Paths lead to the top of the forested cliffs, providing views of Non Nuoc Beach and the South China Sea. The caves in the cliffs were originally inhabited by the Cham people. Later, the Nguyen dynasty built numerous pagodas among the caves. The Marble Mountains are home to various artisans producing sculpture and artwork at its base at Non Nuoc Village. Non Nuoc Beach is a white sandy beach on the outskirts of Đà Nẵng that is renowned for its history as an R&R destination for American troops during the Vietnam War. Today, the beach, along with Mỹ Khê beach to the north, are home to expensive resorts, surfing, and entertainment facilities. Ba Na Hills is a mountain resort with a 5 km-long cable car system which carries guests up to Ba Na's peak at 1487m above sea level. Son Tra Mountain, just some miles away from the city centre with some wild streams and resorts along the seaside. [citation needed] The central coastal city of Da Nang saw a significant growth in international tourist arrivals in 2017, according to the city's Department of Tourism. In 2017, about 6. 6 million visitors came to Da Nang, up 19% over the previous year and 4. 8% higher than its yearly target. The figure included 4. 3 million domestic tourists, up 11. 3% year-on-year. The central city earned over VND19. 4 trillion (US$853. 96 million) in revenue, an increase of 20. 6% from 2016. Statistics also show that the city witnessed an impressive increase in the number of visitors by air which stood at over 1. 58 million, up 74. 4% while by-car visitors via Thailand and Laos was estimated at 14, 120. [59] In 2016, Da Nang was voted one of the top 10 resort destinations in Asia by readers of Smart Travel Asia magazine. [60][61] In 2018, Da Nang was also listed as one of the destinations to visit before it became too famous on the Business Insider website. [62] According to the Japanese newspaper Nikkei, in the 2018 ranking of tourist destinations by Airbnb – the world's largest accommodation booking website, Da Nang ranked 5th globally and 1st in Southeast Asia in terms of attracting tourists.

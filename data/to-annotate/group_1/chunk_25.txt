IBM SQL compatibility" while IBM's software ran "only on IBM mainframes". [88] By
the mid-1980s the company described its database as "the last DBMS", bragging that
Oracle now had larger database revenue than dBASE maker Ashton-Tate, [89] and stating
that Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, and Sybase's planned Microsoft SQL Server "jumped on
Oracle's SQL bandwagon". [90] MacDonald credited Oracle with "being marketing oriented
before any of the competitors . .. pushing the envelope on selling the future way
ahead of the rest of us". [87] Stu Schuster of Sybase said "Larry taught us a lot
about marketing". While other database companies' brochures emphasized technical features,
Oracle advertisements showed an Oracle jet fighter shooting down an Ashton-Tate biplane.
[89][19][12] dBASE, IBM, and Db2 were among the many competitors Oracle marketing
criticized by name. [88] Conversely, another Oracle ad quoted Microsoft's Bill Gates,
Sun's Scott McNealy, Hewlett-Packard's John A. Young, and Apple Computer's John Sculley
as agreeing with Ellison on Oracle's database breakthroughs. [91] Larry Rowe of Ingres
said "you could never come up with a strategy to beat Oracle because whatever you
said today, two days later Ellison was saying it with more marketing dollars". [85]
Jacobs said, by contrast: [12] It really surprises me when people say Oracle's a great
marketing machine because by definition, if you think a company has great marketing,
they don't. If you think they have great technology then they do have a great marketing
machine. Larry's belief has fundamentally always been that marketing isn't critical;
he's famous for saying, "If you're not building the product and you're not selling
it, tell me what it is you do. " Because those are the things that he felt were important.
So marketing has never been a focus. The "benchmark wars" began in the early 1980s;
[85] Roger Sippl of Informix said that when his company's product beat Oracle on 27
of 30 benchmarks, advertisements titled "Oracle wins again! " appeared citing the
three it won, [87] and Ellison allegedly called Dave DeWitt at the University of Wisconsin
after he developed a benchmark unfavorable to Oracle, threatening to get the professor
fired. [85] Schuster and Held recalled "a not very pleasant environment because it
was so directly competitive". They and Sippl described "a vicious cycle" of companies
battling each other over, for example, whose distributed database had the best two-phase
commit: [92][87][19] The ads weren't to let me show you how my product helps you solve
your business problem, Mr. Customer. It's let me tell you how much better I am than
the guy down the street to the point of taking out billboards. Even IBM participated
in the "billboard wars". [19] By 1995 Oracle had 44% of the $2. 4 billion relational
database market; Sybase had 17% and Informix had 16%. By 1996 Informix, after acquiring
Illustra, became Oracle's most important rival. [93] The intense war between Informix
CEO Phil White and Ellison made front-page news in Silicon Valley for three years.

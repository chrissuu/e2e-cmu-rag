born in Pennsylvania, 18. 4% were born in a different U. S. state, 1. 5% were born
in Puerto Rico, U. S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5. 6%
were foreign born. [99] Foreign-born Pennsylvanians are largely from Asia (36. 0%),
Europe (35. 9%), and Latin America (30. 6%) with the remainder from Africa (5%), North
America (3. 1%), and Oceania (0. 4%). The state's largest ancestry groups, expressed
as a percentage of total people who responded with a particular ancestry for the 2010
census, were German 28. 5%, Irish 18. 2%, Italian 12. 8%, African Americans 9. 6%,
English 8. 5%, Polish 7. 2%, and French 4. 2%. [100][101] As of 2018, the top countries
of origin for Pennsylvania's immigrants were India, the Dominican Republic, China,
Mexico, and Vietnam. [102] The vast majority of Pennsylvania's population is made
up of whites, blacks and Hispanics, with the latter two being minorities and having
significant populations. Non-Hispanic Whites make up the majority of Pennsylvania;
they are mostly descended from German, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Italian, and English
immigrants. Rural portions of South Central Pennsylvania are recognized nationally
for their Amish communities. Wyoming Valley, including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre,
has the highest percentage of white residents of any metropolitan area with a population
of 500, 000 or above in the U. S. ; in Wyoming Valley, 96. 2% of the population claim
to be white with no Hispanic background. The state's Hispanic or Latino American population
grew by 82. 6% between 2000 and 2010, marking one of the largest increases in a state's
Hispanic population. The significant growth of the Hispanic or Latino population is
due to migration to the state mainly from Puerto Rico, a U. S. territory, and to a
lesser extent immigration from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and
various Central and South American nations and a wave of Hispanic and Latinos leaving
New York City and New Jersey for more affordable living. [citation needed] Romani
people have been present in the state since the mid-1800s. [103] The majority of Hispanic
or Latino Americans in Pennsylvania are of Puerto Rican descent. [104][105] Most of
the remaining Hispanic or Latino population is made up of Mexicans and Dominicans,
and the majority of Hispanics and Latinos are concentrated in Philadelphia, the Lehigh
Valley, and South Central Pennsylvania. [106] The Hispanic or Latino population is
greatest in Bethlehem, Allentown, Reading, Lancaster, York, and around Philadelphia.
As of 2010, the vast majority of Hispanics and Latino Americans in Pennsylvania, about
85%, live within a 150-mile (240 km) radius of Philadelphia, and about 20% live in
the city itself. The Asian population swelled by almost 60%, mostly Indian, Vietnamese,
and Chinese immigrants, and many Asians moving to Philadelphia from New York City.
The rapid growth of this community has given Pennsylvania one of the largest Asian
populations in the nation. The African American population grew by 13%, which was

the passage of the Electoral Act provided for the university to become a constituency
for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as soon as there were 100 graduates of
the university holding higher degrees eligible for candidacy. This seat in the New
South Wales legislature was first filled in 1876, but was abolished in 1880, one year
after its second member, Sir Edmund Barton, who later became the first Prime Minister
of Australia, was elected to the Legislative Assembly. [27][28] The university was
one of the first in the world to admit women on an equal basis with men, doing so
from 1881. [19] In 1885 the first women to receive BA degrees from the university
were Mary Elizabeth Brown and Isola Florence Thompson, [25] while Thompson became
the first woman to graduate with an MA in 1887. [29] Most of the estate of John Henry
Challis was bequeathed to the university, which received a sum of £200, 000 in 1889.
This was thanks in part due to Sir William Montagu Manning (chancellor 1878–95) who
argued against the claims by British tax commissioners. The following year, seven
professorships were created in anatomy, zoology, engineering, history, law, logic
and mental philosophy, and modern literature. In 1924, the university awarded its
first Doctor of Science in Engineering degree to John Bradfield. His thesis was titled
"The City and Suburban Electric Railways and the Sydney Harbour Bridge". Bradfield
went on to be the lead engineer for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
[30][31] The university's professor of philosophy from 1927 to 1958, John Anderson,
was a significant figure referred to as "Sydney's best known academic". [32] A native
of Scotland, Anderson's controversial views as a self-proclaimed atheist and advocate
of free thought in all subjects raised the ire of many, even to the point of being
censured by the state legislature in 1943. [32]: 20–1 The PhD research degree was
first discussed in 1944 and began in 1947. The university awarded the first PhD in
1951 to William H. Wittrick from the Faculty of Engineering on 28 April 1951 and the
next two were awarded to Eleanora C. Gyarfas and George F. Humphrey from the Faculty
of Science on 2 May 1951. [33] The New England University College was founded as part
of the University of Sydney in 1938 and in 1954 was separated to become the University
of New England. [34] During the late 1960s, the University of Sydney was at the centre
of rows to introduce courses on Marxism and feminism at the major Australian universities.
At one stage, newspaper reporters descended on the university to cover brawls, demonstrations,
secret memos and a walk-out by David Armstrong, a philosopher who held the Challis
Chair of Philosophy from 1959 to 1991, after students at one of his lectures openly
demanded a course on feminism. [35] The philosophy department split over the issue
into the Traditional and Modern Philosophy Department, headed by Armstrong and following

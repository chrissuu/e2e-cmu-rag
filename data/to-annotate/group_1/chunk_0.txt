subject to any tax to which he has not given his own consent, in person or by proxy.
” [22] The resulting protests eventually coalesced into the American Revolution (1775-83).
And, yet, as if ignoring this founding principle of the country, many with felony
convictions who pay taxes are denied their representation because they are denied
their right to vote. According to the Internal Revenue Service, the government office
tasked with collecting taxes, “Incarceration neither changes one’s obligation to pay
taxes and tax debts nor prohibits the receipt of tax credits and deductions upon release.
” [23] Felony disenfranchisement policies also violate international law, according
to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which recommends that the United States
“should adopt appropriate measures to ensure that states restore voting rights to
citizens who have fully served their sentences and those who have been released on
parole. ” [24] A 2019 Brennan Center report “concludes that post-incarceration voting
rights restoration builds a stronger democracy, advances civil rights, ends second-class
citizenship, aids law enforcement, empowers family and communities, and assures fair
and accurate voter rolls. ” [25] Pro Quotes Tarra Simmons, Democratic Washington State
Representative, who was formerly incarcerated for felony theft and drug crimes, stated:
“When you are told that you are not worthy of being a part of that collective decision
making, it’s like another layer of stigma that you walk through the world with, and
that internalized message that I am not worthy … that this community doesn’t want
me here is what leads people to being isolated. In that isolation, people are more
likely to relapse with their substance use disorder or commit a new crime because
they’re not connected… The years of time that people spend in prison is a sufficient
deterrent, is a sufficient punishment. When we over punish people, when we saddle
them with thousands of dollars of court fines and fees and we take away the right
to vote and we tell them that they can’t get a job or a place to live — all of that
is actually harming all of us because that’s creating more crime. ” —Quinn Scanlan,

“We also know that the overwhelming majority of Americans favor restoring voting rights
to people who have either completed their sentences, or are living in the community
while on probation or parole. Those voices and that commitment to democracy should
be heard and reflected in our laws and policies at the local and national level… We
believe that the bedrock of any democracy is the right to vote. Laws that exclude
people from voting have destabilized communities and families in America for decades
by denying them a voice in determining their futures. ” —Kristen O’Toole, “The Sentencing

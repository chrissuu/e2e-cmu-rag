the 1890s. Transport of agricultural and mining products by barge, however, saw a revival in the early twentieth century. [191][192] Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Missouri River has been extensively engineered for water transport purposes, and about 32 percent of the river now flows through artificially straightened channels. [12] In 1912, the USACE was authorized to maintain the Missouri to a depth of six feet (1. 8 meters) from the Port of Kansas City to the mouth, a distance of 368 miles (592 km). [18] This was accomplished by constructing levees and wing dams to direct the river's flow into a straight, narrow channel and prevent sedimentation. In 1925, the USACE began a project to widen the river's navigation channel to 200 feet (61 m); two years later, they began dredging a deep-water channel from Kansas City to Sioux City. These modifications have reduced the river's length from some 2, 540 miles (4, 090 km) in the late 19th century to 2, 341 miles (3, 767 km) in the present day. [6][193] Construction of dams on the Missouri under the Pick-Sloan Plan in the mid-twentieth century was the final step in aiding navigation. The large reservoirs of the Mainstem System help provide a dependable flow to maintain the navigation channel year-round, and are capable of halting most of the river's annual freshets. [194] However, high and low water cycles of the Missouri – notably the protracted early-21st-century drought in the Missouri River basin[195] and historic floods in 1993[196] and 2011[197] – are difficult for even the massive Mainstem System reservoirs to control. [197] In 1945, the USACE began the Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project, which would permanently increase the river's navigation channel to a width of 300 feet (91 m) and a depth of nine feet (2. 7 meters). During work that continues to this day, the 735-mile (1, 183 km) navigation channel from Sioux City to St. Louis has been controlled by building rock dikes to direct the river's flow and scour out sediments, sealing and cutting off meanders and side channels, and dredging the riverbed. [198] However, the Missouri has often resisted the efforts of the USACE to control its depth. In 2006, the U. S. Coast Guard stated that commercial barge tows ran aground in the Missouri River because the navigation channel had been severely silted. [199] The USACE was blamed for failing to maintain the channel to the minimum depth. [200] In 1929, the Missouri River Navigation Commission estimated the amount of goods shipped on the river annually at 15 million tons (13. 6 million metric tons), providing widespread consensus for the creation of a navigation channel. However, shipping traffic has since been far lower than expected – shipments of commodities including produce, manufactured items, lumber, and oil averaged only 683, 000 tons (616, 000 t) per year from 1994 to 2006. [201] By tonnage of transported material, Missouri is by far the largest user of the river accounting for 83 percent of river traffic, while Kansas has 12 percent, Nebraska three percent and Iowa two percent. Almost all of the barge traffic on the Missouri River ships sand and gravel dredged from the lower 500 miles (800 km) of the river; the remaining portion of the shipping channel now sees little to no use by commercial vessels. [201] For navigation purposes, the Missouri River is divided into two main sections. The Upper Missouri River is north of Gavins Point Dam, the last hydroelectric dam of fifteen on the river, just upstream from Sioux City, Iowa. [202] The Lower Missouri River is the 840 miles (1, 350 km) of river below Gavins Point until it meets the Mississippi just above St. Louis. The Lower Missouri River has no hydroelectric dams or locks but it has a plethora of wing dams that enable barge traffic by directing the flow of the river into a 200-foot-wide (61 m), 12-foot-deep (3. 7 m) channel. These wing dams have been put in place by and are maintained by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, and there are no plans to construct any locks to replace these wing dams on the Missouri River. Tonnage of goods shipped by barges on the Missouri River has seen a serious decline from the 1960s to the present. In the 1960s, the USACE predicted an increase to 12 million short tons (11 Mt) per year by 2000, but instead the opposite has happened. The amount of goods plunged from 3. 3 million short tons (3. 0 Mt) in 1977 to just 1. 3 million short tons (1. 2 Mt) in 2000. [203] One of the largest drops has been in agricultural products, especially wheat. Part of the reason is that irrigated land along the Missouri has only been developed to a fraction of its potential. [204] In 2006, barges on the Missouri hauled only 200, 000 short tons (180, 000 t) of products which is equal to the daily freight traffic on the Mississippi. [204] Drought conditions in the early 21st century and competition from other modes of transport – mainly railroads – are the primary reason for decreasing river traffic on the Missouri. The USACE's failure to consistently maintain the navigation channel has also hampered the industry. Efforts are being made to revive the shipping industry on the Missouri River, because of the efficiency and cheapness of river transport to haul agricultural products, and the overcrowding of alternative transportation routes. Solutions such as expanding the navigation channel and releasing more water from reservoirs during the peak of the navigation season are under consideration. [205] Drought conditions lifted in 2010, in which about 334, 000 short tons (303, 000 t) were barged on the Missouri, representing the first significant increase in shipments since 2000. However, flooding in 2011 closed record stretches of the river to boat traffic – "wash[ing] away hopes for a bounce-back year". [206] There are no lock and dams on the lower Missouri River, but there are plenty of wing dams that jettie out into the river and make it harder for barges to navigate. In contrast, the upper Mississippi has 29 locks and dams and averaged 61. 3 million tons of cargo annually from 2008 to 2011, [207] and its locks are closed in the winter. [208][209] Historically, the thousands of square miles that comprised the floodplain of the Missouri River supported a wide range of plant and animal species. Biodiversity generally increased proceeding downstream from the cold, subalpine headwaters in Montana to the temperate, moist climate of Missouri. Today, the river's riparian zone consists primarily of cottonwoods, willows and sycamores, with several other types of trees such as maple and ash. [210] Average tree height generally increases farther from the riverbanks for a limited distance, as land next to the river is vulnerable to soil erosion during floods. Because of its large sediment concentrations, the Missouri does not support many aquatic invertebrates. [210] However, the basin supports about 300 species of birds[210] and 150 species of fish, [211] some of which are endangered such as the pallid sturgeon. The Missouri's aquatic and riparian habitats also support several species of mammals, such as minks, river

which reports a 79 per cent startup survival rate—demonstrates a commitment to innovation.
[113] Reflecting this, the 2023 QS MBA Rankings by Career Specialisation ranked its
MBA programme 3rd worldwide for entrepreneurship. [114] Imperial is also recognised
for its interdisciplinary scientific research. Its strategic collaborations with institutions
around the world have led to advancements that inform industries and public policy.
The college’s basic and translational research reinforces its reputation as an institution
where research and entrepreneurship complement one another. Imperial's focus on practical
subjects—engineering, science, medicine, and business—along with its emphasis on entrepreneurship
and industry collaborations, has made it a leader in the UK for career outcomes. [113]
In 2024, Imperial was ranked 1st in the UK for highly skilled employment or further
studies by the Complete University Guide, [115] the Guardian University Guide, [116]
and the Times Good University Guide. [117] An analysis of Higher Education Statistics
Agency salary data for 2021 found that Imperial graduates had the highest median salaries
of any UK university. [118] For the 2023/24 academic year, Imperial had a total full-time
student body of 19, 400, consisting of 10, 475 undergraduate students and 8, 925 postgraduates.
[119] 50. 7% of the student body is from outside of the UK. [120] 32% of all full-time
students came from outside the European Union in 2013–14, [121] and around 13% of
the International students had Chinese nationality in 2007–08. [122] Imperial's male
to female ratio for undergraduate students is uneven at approximately 64: 36 overall,
[122] and 5: 1 or higher in some engineering courses. However, medicine has an approximate
1: 1 ratio with biology degrees tending to be higher. [123] Imperial College Union
is the students' union and is run by five full-time sabbatical officers elected from
the student body for a tenure of one year, and a number of permanent members of staff.
It is split into constituent unions aligned with the faculties of the college, carrying
on the association with the original constituent colleges of Imperial, the Royal College
of Science Union, City and Guilds College Union, Royal School of Mines Students' Union
and Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union. The Union is given a large
subvention by the university, much of which is spent on maintaining over 300 clubs,
projects and societies. [124] Examples of notable student groups and projects are
Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development
programmes in rural Nepal[125] and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project
in Central America. [126] The Union also hosts sports-related clubs such as Imperial
College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club. The Union operates on two sites,
with most events at the Union Building on Beit Quad at South Kensington, with mostly
medical school events at the Reynold's bar, Charing Cross. Sports facilities at Imperial's
London campuses include four gyms, including the main Ethos gym at the South Kensington
Campus, two swimming pools and two sports halls. [127] Imperial has additional sports

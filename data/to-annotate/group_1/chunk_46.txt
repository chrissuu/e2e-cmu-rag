" and "jagoffs in Baltimore/Philadelphia, " all punctuated by an exaggerated laugh
track, [3][5] which would eventually be removed. The idiosyncrasies of the Pittsburgh
dialect plays a large role in the show, including such regional words as "yinz, "
which means "you (plural)"; "nebby", which describes a nosy person; and "redd up",
an idiomatic phrase (imported from Scots into regional American English) which means
to clean up and/or to make a space orderly. [6][7] On February 11, 2019, Keith Wootton,
the father of Curt Wootton and one of the major inspirations for the series, died.
[8] The first several episodes were recorded "just for fun" on an iPhone, with the
intended audience only the two men's families and friends. [4] It quickly became an
Internet hit, generating 3 million YouTube views within 6 months. [3][4] The series
appeals to both current and ex-Pittsburghers, many of whom relate to the character's
speech patterns and temperament. [3] In 2011, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette named it
the 3rd best internet video of the year. [9] In November 2012, both Preksta and Wootton
were hosts and guests of the annual Three Rivers Film Festival in Pittsburgh. [10]
In October 2013, Pittsburgh restaurant chain Eat'n Park issued a special edition "Smiley
Cookie" bearing Pittsburgh Dad's face; the cookie, which was to raise funds for UPMC
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, was the first ever Smiley Cookie to feature the
likeness of a living person. [11] Based on the mention of Hills in the Back to the
Future-themed episode as well as several episodes of Dad wearing Hills-themed attire,
a Pittsburgh-based candle company released a "Pittsburgh Dad's Hills Snack Bar" scented
candle that is supposed to replicate the smell of the popular snack bar from the now-defunct
chain. [12] On January 4, 2015, a video quickly surfaced of Wootton being out of character
at a bar watching both the Steelers playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens as well
as the Pittsburgh Penguins game against the Montreal Canadiens that were playing concurrently.
In the video, a drunken Wootton criticized the Penguins game and ice hockey in general
in a profanity-laced rant caused by the Steelers losing the game to their archrival;
both games resulted in lopsided defeats for the Pittsburgh teams. The next day, Wootton
acknowledged the incident happening and apologized on his official Facebook page.
[13] The following episode of Pittsburgh Dad posted January 7, 2015, poked fun at
the incident, with Dad (all covered in Penguins gear in his kitchen) poking fun at
Wootton and at the end of the episode breaking the fourth wall by acknowledging that
Pittsburgh Dad is a series. [14] The incident would later be briefly referenced in
the episode "Dad Goes Back to the Future. "[15] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has published
guest columns written by "Pittsburgh Dad, " including one for Father's Day 2013. [16]

Melbourne School of Population Health was established, the first of its kind in Australia, and continued the growth of the university. Work at the centre involved contributions from many disciplines, ranging from the social sciences to epidemiology. Health fields such as Indigenous, women's, mental, sexual, and rural health have all been researched at the centre. [34] In 2008, Vice Chancellor Glyn Davis introduced a major restructure of the university's curriculum. The new structure, named the Melbourne Model, replaced traditional undergraduate specialist degrees with a two-degree undergraduate/graduate structure. [35] Over 100 undergraduate degrees were replaced with six generalist degrees, with students taking a general bachelor's degree before specialising in either a professional or research graduate course. [35] The introduction of the model, influenced by North American academia and the Bologna process, was controversial among students and staff. [36][37] Various groups, including trade[38] and student unions, [39] [40] [41] academics, [42] [43] and some students[44][45] criticised the introduction of the new structure, citing job and subject cuts, and a risk of "dumbing down" content. A group of students produced a satirical musical about the model's adoption. [46] A dean from Monash University rejected the model and argued it led to a reduction in student applications to the University of Melbourne. [47] The University of Western Australia is the only other Australian university to adopt the structure. [48] Davis also introduced reforms to university governance, making faculty deans more responsible for producing a financial surplus. [36] Between 2013 and 2015 Davis introduced a wide-reaching restructure of the university's administration, labelled the Business Improvement Program, which led to the sacking of 500 administrative staff and some administrative responsibilities being transferred to academic staff. [49] At the same time in the ten years to 2018 the university embarked on a large capital works program, spending $2 billion on new buildings across the university's campuses. [49] The Melbourne School of Land and Environment was disestablished on 1 January 2015. Its agriculture and food systems department moved alongside veterinary science to form the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, while other areas of study, including horticulture, forestry, geography and resource management, moved to the Faculty of Science in two new departments. In 2019, allegations of a toxic workplace culture within the Faculty of Arts were aired, with a number of senior staff leaving their positions. [50] At the same time, there was controversy over the high salaries earned by the Vice Chancellor, with Davis earning $1. 5 million in 2019, the most of any university head in Australia. [51] Like other Australian Universities, an extraordinary growth in international students took place at the University of Melbourne and meant the university became increasingly reliant on revenue from its overseas student cohort. [52][49] Davis would finish his final term as Vice-Chancellor in 2018 with Duncan Maskell succeeding him on 1 October. In 2020, on-campus teaching was limited to selected clinical placements as a result of social distancing restrictions required by the Victorian State Government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of teaching was moved to online delivery during the first semester. [53] Like many other institutions and workplaces, university faculty members elected to use telecommunication platforms such as Zoom Video Communications, Microsoft Teams, or Skype to conduct live tutorials and provide interactive online learning experiences as a result of the suspension of face-to-face teaching during this time period. [54] In 2020 the university announced it was axing 450 staff in the institution's largest ever layoff of academic staff, despite a planned expenditure of $4. 2 billion for capital works over the decade from 2020. [55][56] Similarly, in semester two of 2021, the majority of teaching was once again moved to online delivery due to the outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 and ensuing lockdowns in Victoria. In response the university announced further job losses, despite the university running an $8m surplus in 2020. [57] Eleven subjects were cut as part of the savings measures including a number of specialist scientific subjects, a move criticised by Nobel Laureate Peter Doherty and others. [58] The halting of international student arrivals as part of the Australian pandemic response was projected to cause a major loss in revenue for the university. [59][60] In 2019 and 2020 the university was also involved in wage theft and underpayment controversies towards its large teaching workforce of casual staff, and began repaying casual tutors for unpaid marking. [61][62] The university was accused of owing Faculty of Arts teaching staff an estimated $6 million. [61] In 2021 the Vice-Chancellor issued an apology for systematically underpaying staff, saying there was â€œa systemic failure of respect from this institution" towards casual staff that resulted in underpaying 1, 000 staff members and requiring the university to pay back $9. 5 million. [63][64] This followed a campaign by the National Tertiary Education Union's University of Melbourne Casuals Branch, which engaged in a series of protests, including one outside the Vice Chancellor's residence. [65][66] The university came under sustained criticism over the poor employment and financial conditions of its highly casualised academic workforce. [67] Over the 2010s the university increasingly casualised its workforce, with reports that between 47 and 72 per cent of its 11, 000 employees were on casual contracts by 2023. [67][68] In 2021 the State Government granted planning approval for a new campus for the university at the urban renewal precinct Fishermans Bend. [69] The $2 billion campus, planned to open in 2026, will focus on engineering and forms part of a large capital works program by the university, which included the demolition of the Student Union Building and the creation of a new student precinct on the south-east corner of the Parkville campus. [70][71] In June 2021, a new speech policy was implemented with the stated purpose of protecting transgender individuals within the university while preserving freedom of speech principles for staff and students. [72] In 2023, windows of the university's Sidney Myer Asia Centre Building were broken and the building was graffitied with a message accusing the university of contributing to an unsafe environment for transgender individuals. [73] In August 2023, all National Tertiary Education Union members who work in the Faculty of Arts, Melbourne Law School, the Victorian College of the Arts School of Art, student services, stagecraft and the library will start a-five to seven day strike. Union members are seeking a 15% increase in wages over the course of 3 years. [74] On 24 April 2024, students occupied the South Lawn of Parkville campus in solidarity with international, grass-roots, student-lead Pro-Palestine movements. [75][76] Concerns arose as students sought to keep the university accountable in its investments. More specifically, to disclose research and investment ties with Israeli Government companies, stocks, or bonds benefiting from the occupation of Palestine and the Gaza humanitarian crisis since October 7, 2023. Students occupied the Arts West building, "renaming" it Mahmoud's hall after a Palestinian student who was expected to commence his studies at the university but died in the Gaza war. [77][78] On 29 April 2024, it was announced that Vice-Chancellor Maskell would step down from his position, partway through his second term, by early 2025.

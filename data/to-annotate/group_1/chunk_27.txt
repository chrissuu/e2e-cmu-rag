in mid-December 2019 indicated that Conestoga College had decided to purchase 42 acres of land in this city with the intention of relocating all of the trades and apprenticeship programs (offered at various other campuses) to Cambridge at a future date. Specifics were not immediately provided. [70] Cambridge is home to many cultural events and activities, including the Mill Race Festival and the Rock the Mill music festivals in downtown Galt, and the Cambridge Highland Games in Churchill Park in July. [71] There is also the Cambridge Butterfly Conservatory, the annual dragon boat festival, the Cambridge fall fair, and the Santa Claus Parade. There is also the festive "Christmas in Cambridge" winter festival at Christmas featuring events like Unsilent Night, which began in New York City by Phil Kline. The City of Cambridge's take on this event uniquely involves other aspects of the community such as Christie digital projection technology. University of Waterloo School of Architecture Cambridge students in Dr. Jeff Lederer's Urban Revitalization and Design class designed the spectacular light installations. The Cambridge Farmers' Market has been in operation in the original building on the original site circa 1830; making it the third-oldest market in the country. The Cambridge Farmers' Market is now ranked as one of the top 10 markets in the country by Best Health Magazine. All the vendors come from within a 100 km radius to sell fresh fruits, cheese, vegetables, baked goods and more. The Cambridge Centre of the Arts is a municipally operated community arts centre that is available to area residents, artists and organizations. The Arts Centre was opened in May 2001. Cambridge Galleries are a part of the Cambridge Public Library system or Idea Exchange, with art exhibition spaces at Queen's Square, Preston and the new Design at Riverside location. Together, the three galleries host approximately 23 exhibitions per year. Along with the art gallery projects, Cambridge Libraries (Idea Exchange) are undergoing a $13. 5 million restoration project of a former post-office into a digital library. [72] The building was unused for some time before the city bought it for $950, 000 and a Parks Canada grant of $800, 000 restored some of the building. [72] The new project will not house physical print but focus on 3D & laser printers, maker labs, performance and studio for teen, a large children's area including a Lego wall and a coffee shop. [72] The Federal and Ontario governments and the City of Cambridge came together and built the Dunfield Theatre in 2013 in an effort to promote Canadian talent and the performing arts. [73] The 59, 000-square-foot arts complex boasts 500 seats and over $20 million was contributed/donated. Michael Chan Minister of Tourism, Culture, and Sport said of the theatre's construction: "Arts and culture help to stimulate the economy, draw visitors to our province and enhance our quality of life. .. The new Dunfield Theatre Cambridge will enrich the cultural fabric of this community and provide exciting opportunities for people to engage in the arts. The Ontario government is pleased to support such a worthy project. "[73] In 2018, the theatre's name was changed to the Hamilton Family Theatre. [74] In June 2008, the new Cambridge City Hall facility opened as the first city hall in Canada to achieve the ranking of gold in the LEED from the Canada Green Building Council. The $30 million project was completed on time and on budget and financed through a settlement of a loan with the city's hydro utility. A conservative estimate comparing a standard 85, 000-square-foot (7, 900 m2) building to the new City Hall LEED-standard building results in a $160, 000 savings on energy per year or some $1. 6 million over 10 years. The open concept of the facility allows for greater airflow, reducing cooling costs and increasing the penetration of natural light to offset other light sources. A four-story "living wall" of tropical plants is located in the atrium and cleanses the air of pollutants such as formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds, dust, and spores. Behind the living wall is a running water supply that provides humidity during the winter months and a soothing sound for employees and visitors to enjoy all year round. The historic city hall in Cambridge was built in 1858 by local architect H. B. Sinclair for $3, 650, replacing the original structure built in 1838. Built of granite and white limestone, locally found blue granite was used as a decorative feature. The Historic City Hall served as the community's town hall and marketplace. Today, the Historic City Hall and the New City Hall are connected by a hallway constructed shortly after the New City Hall was built. In the tradition of environmental stewardship, Cambridge preserves over 365 hectares (900 acres) of parkland which make up more than 80 parks in the city, as well as over 140 kilometres (87 mi) of on-road cycling lanes. The McDougall Cottage in downtown Galt is a historic granite and limestone cottage built in 1858. It is currently a museum. [75] In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cambridge had a population of 138, 479 living in 51, 269 of its 53, 013 total private dwellings, a change of 6. 6% from its 2016 population of 129, 920. With a land area of 112. 99 km2 (43. 63 sq mi), it had a population density of 1, 225. 6/km2 (3, 174. 3/sq mi) in 2021. [76] At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Kitchener - Cambridge - Waterloo CMA had a population of 575, 847 living in 219, 060 of its 229, 809 total private dwellings, a change of 9. 9% from its 2016 population of 523, 894. With a land area of 1, 092. 33 km2 (421. 75 sq mi), it had a population density of 527. 2/km2 (1, 365. 4/sq mi) in 2021. [77] In 2021, the median age was 39. 2 years, [78] lower than the provincial median age of 41. 6 years. [79] 17. 7% of the population was under 15 years of age and 16% was 65 years and over. According to the 2021 census, the population of Cambridge was approximately 74. 3% White, 23. 9% visible minority and 1. 9% Indigenous. The largest visible minority group, at 11. 7% of the population, was South Asian, followed by Black (3. 6%), Latin American (1. 7%), Filipino (1. 3%), Southeast Asian (1. 2%), Arab (1. 1%), and Chinese (0. 9%).

Others identify as Muslim (6. 8%), Sikh (2. 9%), Hindu (2. 9%), and Buddhist (0. 7%). 31. 4% of the population report no religious affiliation, up from 24% in 2011[85] There are two main arterial roads that form an 'X' through the city. The intersecting point is colloquially referred to as the Delta. The intersection was once known as Hunter's Corners. [86] The Delta is adjacent to a Canadian Pacific Rail spur and the Babcock & Wilcox plant, and at peak rush hour times traffic would back up for miles radiating outwards from the Delta. A number of strategies were investigated to alleviate delays caused

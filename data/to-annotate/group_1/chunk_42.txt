joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and Consol Energy Center. [104][105]
The Penguins have two minor league affiliates assigned to their team. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton
Penguins, their AHL affiliate, have played in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania,
since 1999. The Penguins also have a secondary affiliate in the ECHL, the Wheeling
Nailers, which they have been associated with since the start of the 2000â€“01 ECHL
season. [106] Despite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal
fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times
averaging only 6, 000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over
16, 000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no
problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when
the team faced another relocation threat. While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued
interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of
former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald, [107] noted in his autobiography that
upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the
Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins. [108] However,
Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured
upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in
attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's
most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are
considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional
sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles
both on and off the field. [109] Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the
four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked
20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one
and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround)[110]
ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times
rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level. [111] The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation
conducts numerous community activities to support both youth and families through
hockey education and charity assistance. This is a partial list of the last five seasons
completed by the Penguins. [112] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T

September 17, 2025[113][114] The NHL retired Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 for all its member
teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game. [119] The Pittsburgh Penguins presently acknowledge
an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Inductees affiliated
with the Penguins include 15 former players and five builders of the sport. [c][120]

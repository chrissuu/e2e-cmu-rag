the most impact on the year at hand with interviews on their perspective of the year.
As part of the special, Couric interviews fellow members of the media that can provide
some insight on some events that occurred. From April 2 to 6, 2012, Couric substituted
for co-anchor Robin Roberts on ABC's Good Morning America, her first stint at hosting
a morning news show since leaving Today. On June 6, 2011, ABC announced that Couric
had signed a record US$40-million contract, [54] and would begin hosting a daytime
talk show for its Disney-ABC Domestic Television arm that would debut in September
2012; Couric would also contribute to ABC News programming. [55] On August 22, 2011,
it was announced that Couric's talk show would be called Katie. Katie is the second
web show that Couric has been affiliated with, the first being @katiecouric on the
CBS Evening News. [needs context] The first episode aired on September 10, 2012. [56][57]
Couric has incorporated her affiliation with the ABC News Division with her ABC Daytime
show by having news colleagues Christiane Amanpour, Deborah Roberts, Mike Boettcher,
Matt Gutman, Richard Besser, Marci Gonzalez, Jim Avila, Dan Abrams, Josh Elliott,
Brian Ross, ABC News weather anchors Sam Champion and Ginger Zee, as well as ABC World
News anchors Diane Sawyer and David Muir correspond on Katie for important news events.
On the domestic end of her affiliation, Couric has had as guests The View co-host
Whoopi Goldberg, Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan of Live! with Kelly and Michael, as
well as some cast members of the soap opera General Hospital. Disney-ABC Domestic
Television renewed Katie for a second season starting in fall 2013. [58] However,
in October 2013, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Katie was close to cancellation
because of a low Q Score, low ratings, and a reported disdain of her core female audience.
The syndicated show averaged a 1. 7 household rating during its first season and a
1. 8 in the 2013–14 season. [59] In December 2013, Disney–ABC Domestic Television
announced that Katie had been canceled. [60][61] The last show was taped on June 12,
2014[62] and the series finale aired on July 30, 2014. In November 2013, Yahoo! CEO
Marissa Mayer announced she had hired Couric as Global Anchor of Yahoo! News. [63]
Couric debuted in the new role on January 13, 2014, in an interview with former United
States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. [64] She later interviewed United States
Secretary of State John Kerry. In March 2015, in an effort to collaborate and to consolidate
their news pools, Yahoo News and ABC News has expanded their partnership to include
specials and features, with Couric and other Yahoo editors to appear in daily segments
on Good Morning America. The extended partnership secured Couric as having a spot
in the ABC News division, as a special contributor. In her book Going There, Couric
admitted to editing a 2016 interview with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Securities and Exchange Commission. [94] Information that EDMC provided to the Senate Harkin Commission indicates that of the 78, 661 students who enrolled at EDMC-owned colleges in 2008â€“9, 62. 1 percent, or 48, 840 students, dropped out as of mid-2010. [92] As of 2013, about 120, 000 students attended Education Management Corporation-operated schools, a drop from its peak of 160, 000. [95] In July 2016, a Maine Sunday Telegram expose found that former EDMC CEO John R. McKernan Jr. used a non-profit charity, the EDMC Foundation, to skirt federal 90/10 regulations. The expose was based on three-month investigation. [96] In 2010, several EDMC shareholders initiated a lawsuit alleging that EDMC had misled investors prior to the company's 2009 IPO, causing investors to lose money when the company's stock fell in 2010. The lawsuit was later joined by EDMC shareholders OPPRS and SEPTA. The case was dismissed by a federal judge in September 2011, as the shareholders were unable to show that the company had lied to investors. [97] In April 2016, two former teachers at the Art Institute of California sued EDMC for not giving them a minimum wage and for not offering adequate rest periods in order to 'reduce compensation and increase its own profits. '[98] In February 2014, Standard & Poor's cut EDMC's credit rating to CCC+ because of declining enrollment. [99] Moody's credit rating service in January 2015 dropped EDMC to its lowest rating, D-PD, which it defines as "Corporate families rated D are in default on all of their long-term debt obligations. "[5] [100] In 2014, EDMC's major creditor, KKR took control over EDMC's assets. [4] As of July 30, 2016, EDMC sold as an over the counter stock at approximately one cent per share. [101] In 2016, former nursing students at Brown Mackie College in Tucson, Arizona sued the school, alleging that the poor training they received left them unable to be gainfully employed. The plaintiffs expected to graduate in 2015 until a state nursing board investigation found some of the school's faculty were unqualified and were using veterinary supplies to teach students how to care for human patients. The Arizona nursing board barred the Brown Mackie students from taking the practical nurses licensing exam and ordered the school to retrain the students at the company's expense. [102] By the end of 2016, EDMC's legal perils had ensnared even the company's outside legal counsel at the Pittsburgh-based global law firm Reed Smith LLP. [103] Advised by Attorney Katherine Ryan before two federal judges in discrimination lawsuits dating to August 2012, the company was defeated when the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a sweeping October 18 order invalidating an alternative dispute resolution policy superimposed retroactively on the company's employees; EDMC had tried to bar aggrieved employees from filing suit in any court for any purpose. [104] The 3-0 panel found that the policy had been illegally superimposed without employees' assent and thereby reinstated a pair of federal cases against the Art Institute of Pittsburgh demanding more than $4 million in damages and alleging legal malpractice inside EDMC.

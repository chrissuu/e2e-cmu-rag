the SAT at present does not contain any questions to that effect. Spatial reasoning
skills are important for success in STEM. [121] A 2006 study led by psychometrician
Robert Sternberg found that the ability of SAT scores and high-school GPAs to predict
collegiate performance could further be enhanced by additional assessments of analytical,
creative, and practical thinking. [122][123] Experimental psychologist Meredith Frey
noted that while advances in education research and neuroscience can help incrementally
improve the ability to predict scholastic achievement in the future, the SAT or other
standardized tests likely will remain a valuable tool to build upon. [14] In a 2014
op-ed for The New York Times, psychologist John D. Mayer called the predictive powers
of the SAT "an astonishing achievement" and cautioned against making it and other
standardized tests optional. [124][15] Research by psychometricians David Lubinsky,
Camilla Benbow, and their colleagues has shown that the SAT could even predict life
outcomes beyond university. [15] The SAT rigorously assesses students' mental stamina,
memory, speed, accuracy, and capacity for abstract and analytical reasoning. [99]
For American universities and colleges, standardized test scores are the most important
factor in admissions, second only to high-school GPAs. [123] By international standards,
however, the SAT is not that difficult. [125] For example, South Korea's College Scholastic
Ability Test (CSAT) and Finland's Matriculation Examination are both longer, tougher,
and count for more towards the admissibility of a student to university. [126] In
many countries around the world, exams, including university entrance exams, are the
sole deciding factor of admission; school grades are simply irrelevant. [125] In China
and India, doing well on the Gaokao or the IIT-JEE, respectively, enhances the social
status of the students and their families. [127] In an article from 2012, educational
psychologist Jonathan Wai argued that the SAT was too easy to be useful to the most
competitive of colleges and universities, whose applicants typically had brilliant
high-school GPAs and standardized test scores. Admissions officers therefore had the
burden of differentiating the top scorers from one another, not knowing whether or
not the students' perfect or near-perfect scores truly reflected their scholastic
aptitudes. He suggested that the College Board make the SAT more difficult, which
would raise the measurement ceiling of the test, allowing the top schools to identify
the best and brightest among the applicants. [128] At that time, the College Board
was already working on making the SAT tougher. [128] The changes were announced in
2014 and implemented in 2016. [129] After realizing the June 2018 test was easier
than usual, the College Board made adjustments resulting in lower-than-expected scores,
prompting complaints from the students, though some understood this was to ensure
fairness. [130] In its analysis of the incident, the Princeton Review supported the
idea of curving grades, but pointed out that the test was incapable of distinguishing
students in the 86th percentile (650 points) or higher in mathematics. The Princeton
Review also noted that this particular curve was unusual in that it offered no cushion

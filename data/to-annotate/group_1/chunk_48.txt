with at least 500 seats, are classified as Broadway theaters. [413] The 2018–19 Broadway
theatre season set records with total attendance of 14. 8 million and gross revenue
of $1. 83 billion[414] Recovering from closures forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, 2022–23
revenues rebounded to $1. 58 billion with total attendance of 12. 3 million. [415][416]
The Tony Awards recognize excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented at
an annual ceremony in Manhattan. [417] The New York area is home to a distinctive
regional accent and speech pattern called the New York dialect, alternatively known
as Brooklynese or New Yorkese. It has been considered one of the most recognizable
accents within American English. [418] The traditional New York area speech pattern
is known for its rapid delivery, and its accent is characterized as non-rhotic so
that the sound [ɹ] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before
a consonant, therefore the pronunciation of the city name as "New Yawk". [419] The
classic version of the New York City dialect is centered on middle- and working-class
New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes
in this distinctive dialect, [419] and the traditional form of this speech pattern
is no longer as prevalent. [419] New York has architecturally noteworthy buildings
in a wide range of styles and from distinct periods, from the Dutch Colonial Pieter
Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, the oldest section of which dates to 1656, to the
modern One World Trade Center, the skyscraper at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan and
the most expensive office tower in the world by construction cost. [420] Manhattan's
skyline, with its many skyscrapers, has been recognized as an iconic symbol of the
city, [421][422][423] and the city has been home to several of the tallest buildings
in the world. As of 2019[update], New York City had 6, 455 high-rise buildings, the
third most in the world after Hong Kong and Seoul. [424] The character of New York's
large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and
townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion
from 1870 to 1930. [425] Stone and brick became the city's building materials of choice
after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great
Fire of 1835. [426] In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less
densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale
(in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family
homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian.
[427][428][429] Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, anchoring Lincoln Square on
the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is home to numerous influential arts organizations,
including the Metropolitan Opera, New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, and
New York City Ballet, as well as the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the Juilliard School,

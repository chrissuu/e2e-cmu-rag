[54] On April 30, 2015, the state moved the city from under an emergency manager receivership to a Receivership Transition Advisory Board. [55] On November 3, 2015, Flint residents elected Karen Weaver as their first female mayor. [56] On January 22, 2016, the Receivership Transition Advisory Board unanimously voted to return some powers, including appointment authority, to the mayor. [57] The Receivership Transit Authority Board was formally dissolved by State Treasurer Nick Khouri on April 10, 2018, returning the city to local control. [58] In April 2014, during a financial crisis, state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley changed Flint's water source from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (sourced from Lake Huron) to the Flint River. [59] The problem was compounded with the fact that anticorrosive measures were not implemented. After two independent studies, lead poisoning caused by the water was found in the area's population. [60][61] This has led to several lawsuits, the resignation of several officials, fifteen criminal indictments, and a federal public health state of emergency for all of Genesee County. [62][63][64][65] Flint lies in the Flint/Tri-Cities region of Michigan. Flint and Genesee County can be categorized as a subregion of Flint/Tri-Cities. It is located along the Flint River, which flows through Lapeer, Genesee, and Saginaw counties and is 78. 3 mi (126. 0 km) long. [66] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 34. 06 square miles (88. 21 km2), of which, 33. 42 square miles (86. 56 km2) is land and 0. 64 square miles (1. 66 km2) is water. [67] Flint lies just to the northeast of the Flint hills. The terrain is low and rolling along the south and east sides, and flatter to the northwest. Flint has several neighborhoods grouped around the center of the city on the four cardinal sides. The downtown business district is centered on Saginaw Street south of the Flint River. Just west, on opposite sides of the river, are Carriage Town (north) and the Grand Traverse Street District (south). Both neighborhoods boast strong neighborhood associations. These neighborhoods were the center of manufacturing for and profits from the nation's carriage industry until the 1920s and are the site of many well-preserved Victorian homes and the setting of Atwood Stadium. The University Avenue corridor of Carriage Town is home to the largest concentration of Greek housing in the area. Many fraternity houses from Kettering University and the University of Michigan-Flint are located there. [citation needed] Just north of downtown is River Village, an example of gentrification via mixed-income public housing. To the east of I-475 is Central Park and Fairfield Village. These are the only two neighborhoods between UM-Flint and Mott Community College and enjoy strong neighborhood associations. Central Park piloted a project to convert street lights to LED and is defined by seven cul-de-sacs. The North Side and 5th Ward are predominantly African American, with such historic districts as Buick City and Civic Park on the north, and Sugar Hill, Floral Park, and Kent and Elm Parks on the south. Many of these neighborhoods were the original centers of early Michigan blues. The South Side in particular was also a center for multi-racial migration from Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Deep South since World War II. These neighborhoods are most often lower income but have maintained some level of economic stratification. The East Side is the site of the Applewood Mott Estate, and Mott Community College, the Cultural Center, and East Village, one of Flint's more prosperous areas. The surrounding neighborhood is called the college/Cultural Neighborhood, with a strong neighborhood association, lower crime rate and stable housing prices. Just north is Eastside Proper, also known as the State Streets, and has much of Flint's Hispanic community. [68] The West Side includes the main site of the 1936–37 sit-down strike, the Mott Park neighborhood, Kettering University, and the historic Woodcroft Estates, owned in the past by legendary automotive executives and current home to prominent and historic Flint families such as the Motts, the Manleys, and the Smiths. Facilities associated with General Motors in the past and present are scattered throughout the city, including GM Truck and Bus, Flint Metal Center and Powertrain South (clustered together on the city's southwestern corner); Powertrain North, Flint Tool and Die and Delphi East. The largest plant, Buick City, and adjacent facilities have been demolished. Half of Flint's fourteen tallest buildings were built during the 1920s. The 19-story Genesee Towers, formerly the city's tallest building, was completed in 1968. [69] The building became unused in later years and fell into severe disrepair: a cautionary sign warning of falling debris was put on the sidewalk in front of it. An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013. Typical of southeastern Michigan, Flint has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), and is part of USDA Hardiness zone 6a. [70] Winters are cold, with moderate snowfall and temperatures not rising above freezing on an average 52 days annually, while dropping to 0 °F (−18 °C) or below on an average 9. 3 days a year; summers are warm to hot with temperatures exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 9. 0 days. [71] The monthly daily mean temperature ranges from 23. 0 °F (−5. 0 °C) in January to 70. 9 °F (21. 6 °C) in July. Official temperature extremes range from 108 °F (42 °C) on July 8 and 13, 1936 down to −25 °F (−32 °C) on January 18, 1976, and February 20, 2015; the record low maximum is −4 °F (−20 °C) on January 18, 1994, while, conversely the record high minimum is 79 °F (26 °C) on July 18, 1942. [71] Decades may pass between readings of 100 °F (38 °C) or higher, which last occurred July 17, 2012. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 8 thru May 7, allowing a growing season of 153 days. [71] On June 8, 1953, Flint was hit by an F5 tornado, which claimed 116 lives. [72] Precipitation is moderate and somewhat evenly-distributed throughout the year, although the warmer months average more, averaging 31. 97 inches (812 mm) annually, but historically ranging from 18. 08 in (459 mm) in 1963 to 45. 38 in (1, 153 mm) in 1975. [71] Snowfall, which typically falls in measurable amounts between November 12 through April 9 (occasionally in October and very rarely in May), [71] averages 52. 1 inches (132 cm) per year, although historically ranging from 16. 0 in (41 cm) in 1944–45 to 85. 3 in (217 cm) in 2017–18. [71] A snow depth of 1 in (2. 5 cm) or more occurs on an average 64 days, with 53 days from December to February. [73] As of the 2023 American Community Survey, there are 33, 670 estimated households in Flint with an average of 2. 33 persons per household. The city has a median household income of $36, 194. Approximately 34. 4% of the city's population lives at or below the poverty line. Flint has an estimated 54. 8% employment rate, with 13. 1% of the population holding a bachelor's degree or higher and 83. 3% holding a high school

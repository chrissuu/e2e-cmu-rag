Villanova University is a private Catholic research university in Villanova, Pennsylvania,
United States. It was founded by the Order of Saint Augustine in 1842 and named after
Saint Thomas of Villanova. The university is the oldest Catholic university in Pennsylvania
and one of two Augustinian institutions of higher learning in the United States (the
other being Merrimack College). The university traces its roots to the old Saint Augustine's
Church, Philadelphia, which the Augustinian friars of the Province of Saint Thomas
of Villanova founded in 1796, and to its parish school, Saint Augustine's Academy,
which was established in 1811. It is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities â€“
High research activity". In October 1841, two Irish Augustinian friars from Saint
Augustine's Church in Philadelphia, with the intention of starting a school, purchased
200 acres (81 ha) in Radnor Township. Known as "Belle Air", the estate belonged to
the late John Rudolph, a merchant of Burlington, New Jersey and Philadelphia. The
school, which was called the "Augustinian College of Villanova", opened in 1842. [5]
Besides the novitiate and college, the Augustinians had pastoral care of Catholics
living within a fifteen-mile radius. Bishop Francis Kenrick dedicated the chapel in
1844. Parishes at Berwyn, Bryn Mawr, and Wayne developed from the Villanova mission.
[6] However, the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844 that burned Saint Augustine's
Church in Philadelphia caused financial difficulties for the Augustinians, and the
college was closed in February 1845. The college reopened in 1846 and graduated its
first class in 1847. In March 1848, the governor of Pennsylvania incorporated the
school and gave it the power to grant degrees. In 1859, the first master's degree
was conferred. [7] In 1857, the school closed again as the demand for priests in Philadelphia
prevented adequate staffing, and the crisis of the Panic of 1857 strained the school
financially. The school remained closed throughout the Civil War and was used as a
military hospital. [8] It reopened in September 1865; since then it has operated continuously.
[9] Its prep school later moved to Malvern, a town along the Main Line. Today it is
called Malvern Preparatory School and is still run by the order. [10] Villanova was
all-male until 1918 when the college began evening classes to educate nuns to teach
in parochial schools. In 1938, a laywoman received a Villanova degree for the first

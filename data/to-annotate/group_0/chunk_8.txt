played at the halftime of the first Super Bowl. Most recently, the Pride's 2014 Daft
Punk show was chosen by the CBDNA (College Band Directors National Association) as
one of ten in the nation to be presented at their National Conference in March 2015.
[125] In 2024, the Pride of Arizona became the 34th recipient of the Sudler Trophy.
[126] Like many large public universities in the U. S. , sports are a major activity
on campus, and receive a large operating budget. Arizona's athletic teams are nicknamed
the Wildcats, a name derived from a 1914 football game with then California champions
Occidental College, where the L. A. Times asserted, "the Arizona men showed the fight
of wildcats. "[127] The University of Arizona participates in the NCAA's Division
I-A in the Big 12 Conference, which it was admitted in 2024. The men's basketball
team has been one of the nation's most successful programs since Lute Olson was hired
as head coach in 1983, and is still known as a national powerhouse in Division I men's
basketball. [128] Between 1985 and 2009, the team reached the NCAA Tournament 25 consecutive
years, which is the third-longest streak in NCAA history, after Kansas, with appearances
from 1990–present, North Carolina, with 27 consecutive appearances from 1975 to 2001.
[129] The Wildcats have reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament in 1988, 1994,
1997, and 2001. In 1997, Arizona defeated the University of Kentucky, the then-defending
national champions, to win the NCAA National Championship (NCAA Men's Division I Basketball
Championship) by a score of 84–79 overtime; Arizona's first national championship
victory. The 1997 championship team became the first and only in NCAA history to defeat
three number-one seeds en route to a national title (Kansas, North Carolina, and Kentucky—the
North Carolina game being the final game for longtime UNC head coach Dean Smith).
Point guard Miles Simon was chosen as 1997 Final Four MVP (Simon was also an assistant
coach under Olson from 2005 to 2008). The Cats also boast the third-highest winning
percentage in the nation over the last twenty years. Arizona has won a total of 28
regular season conference championships in its program's history, and 6 PAC-12 tournaments.
Since 2005, Arizona has produced 17 NBA draft picks. [130][131][132] The Wildcats
play their home games at the McKale Center in Tucson. A number of former Wildcats
have gone on to pursue successful professional NBA careers (especially during the
Lute Olson era), including Gilbert Arenas, Richard Jefferson, Mike Bibby, Jason Terry,
Sean Elliott, Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves, Luke Walton, Hassan Adams, Salim Stoudamire,
Andre Iguodala, Channing Frye, Brian Williams (later known as Bison Dele), Sean Rooks,
Jud Buechler, Michael Dickerson, Chase Budinger, Jordan Hill, Jerryd Bayless, Derrick
Williams, Kadeem Allen, Aaron Gordon, Solomon Hill, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Stanley
Johnson, T. J McConnell, Lauri Elias Markkanen, Kobi Simmons, Steve Kerr, Deandre
Ayton, Rawle Alkins, and Allonzo Trier. Kenny Lofton, now best known as a former Major

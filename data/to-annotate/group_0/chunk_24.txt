American South, with four million enslaved people only liberated with the Civil War
in 1865. [8] During Reconstruction, African Americans gained citizenship and adult-males
the right to vote; however, due to widespread White supremacy, they were treated as
second-class citizens and soon disenfranchised in the South. These circumstances changed
due to participation in the military conflicts of the United States, substantial migration
out of the South, the elimination of legal racial segregation, and the civil rights
movement which sought political and social freedom. However, racism against African
Americans and racial socioeconomic disparity remain a problem into the 21st century.
In the 20th and 21st centuries, immigration has played an increasingly significant
role in the African-American community. As of 2022, 10% of the U. S. Black population
were immigrants, and 20% were either immigrants or the children of immigrants. [9]
While some Black immigrants or their children may also come to identify as African
American, the majority of first-generation immigrants do not, preferring to identify
with their nation of origin. [10][11] Most African Americans are of West African and
coastal Central African ancestry, with varying amounts of Western European and Native
American ancestry. [12] African-American culture has had a significant influence on
worldwide culture, making numerous contributions to visual arts, literature, the English
language, philosophy, politics, cuisine, sports, and music. The African-American contribution
to popular music is so profound that most American music, including jazz, gospel,
blues, rock and roll, funk, disco, house, techno, hip hop, R&B, trap, and soul, has
its origins either partially or entirely in the African-American community. [13][14]
The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic
slave trade were people from several Central and West African ethnic groups. They
had been captured directly by European slave traders in coastal raids, [15] or sold
by West African slave traders, or by half-European "merchant princes"[16] to European
slave traders, who brought them to the Americas. [17] The first African slaves in
what is now the United States arrived in the early 16th century. Africans were among
Juan Ponce de León's 1513 voyage that landed in what would become Spanish Florida,
and enslaved Africans arrived around the same time to Spanish Puerto Rico. [18][19]
Africans also came via Santo Domingo in the Caribbean to the San Miguel de Gualdape
colony (most likely located in the Winyah Bay area of present-day South Carolina),
founded by Spanish explorer Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón in 1526. [20] The ill-fated colony
was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves
revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local Native Americans. De Ayllón
and many of the colonists died shortly afterward, due to an epidemic and the colony
was abandoned. The settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to the Island
of Hispaniola, whence they had come. [20] The enslaved explorer Esteban arrived in
Florida with the Narváez expedition in 1528, a journey that first landed in Santo

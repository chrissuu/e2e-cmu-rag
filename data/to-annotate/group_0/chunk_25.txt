[241] India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India. Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states, [243] has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes. [244][245] The Government of India comprises three branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary. [246] The President of India is the ceremonial head of state, [247] who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures. [248][249] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power. [250] Appointed by the president, [251] the prime minister is supported by the party or political alliance with a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament. [250] The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice-president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament. [247] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and their council are directly responsible to the lower house of the parliament. Civil servants act as permanent executives and all decisions of the executive are implemented by them. [252] The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People). [253] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms with elections every 2 years. [254] Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. [251] The Lok Sabha's 543 members are elected directly by popular vote among citizens aged at least 18; [255] they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms. [256] Several seats from each state are reserved for candidates from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population within that state. [255] India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[257] comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts. [257] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts. [258] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution[259] and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional. [260] India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories. [12] All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. [261] There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels. [262] India became a republic in 1950, remaining a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. [264][265] India strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia in the 1950s; it played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement. [266] After initially cordial relations, India suffered a humiliating military defeat to China in a 1962 war. [267] Another military conflict followed in 1967 in which India successfully repelled a Chinese attack. [268] India has had uneasy relations with its western neighbour, Pakistan. The two countries went to war in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir. In contrast, the 1971 war followed India's support for the independence of Bangladesh. [269] After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union. By the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier. [270] India has played a key role in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the World Trade Organization. The nation has supplied 100, 000 military and police personnel in 35 UN peacekeeping operations. [citation needed] China's nuclear test of 1964 and threats to intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war caused India to produce nuclear weapons. [271] India conducted its first nuclear weapons test in 1974 and carried out additional underground testing in 1998. India has signed neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and discriminatory. [272] India maintains a "no first use" nuclear policy and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its "Minimum Credible Deterrence" doctrine. [273][274] Since the end of the Cold War, India has increased its economic, strategic, and military cooperation with the United States and the European Union. [275] In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce; India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, [276] France, [277] the United Kingdom, [278] and Canada. [279] The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's armed forces. With 1. 45 million active troops, they are the world's second-largest military. It comprises the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard. [281] The official Indian defence budget for 2011 was US$36. 03 billion, or 1. 83% of GDP. [282] Defence expenditure was pegged at US$70. 12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9. 8% on the previous fiscal year. [283][284] India is the world's second-largest arms importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9. 5% of the total global arms imports. [285] Much of the military expenditure was focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean. [286] According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2024 was nominally worth $3. 94 trillion; it is the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, at around $15. 0 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). [16] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5. 8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6. 1% during 2011–2012, [290] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. [291] However, due to its low GDP per capita—which ranks 136th in the world in nominal per capita income and 125th in per capita income adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP)—the vast majority of Indians fall into the low-income group. [292][293] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its

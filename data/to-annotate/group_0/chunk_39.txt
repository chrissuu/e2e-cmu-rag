studio complex in Burbank, which the company fully moved into in 1940 and where the company is still headquartered. [58][59] In April 1940, Disney Productions had its initial public offering, with the common stock remaining with Disney and his family. Disney did not want to go public, but the company needed the money. [60] Shortly before Snow White's release, work began on the company's next features, Pinocchio and Bambi. Pinocchio was released in February 1940 while Bambi was postponed. [55] Despite Pinocchio's critical acclaim (it won the Academy Awards for Best Song and Best Score and was lauded for groundbreaking achievements in animation), [61] the film performed poorly at the box office, due to World War II affecting the international box office. [62][63] The company's third feature Fantasia (1940) introduced groundbreaking advancements in cinema technology, chiefly Fantasound, an early surround sound system making it the first commercial film to be shown in stereo. However, Fantasia similarly performed poorly at the box office. [64][65][66] In 1941, the company experienced a major setback when 300 of its 800 animators, led by one of the top animators Art Babbitt, went on strike for 5 weeks for unionization and higher pay. Walt Disney publicly accused the strikers of being party to a communist conspiracy and fired many of them, including some of the studio's best. [67][68] Roy unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the company's main distributors to invest in the studio, which could no longer afford to offset production costs with employee layoffs. [69] The anthology film The Reluctant Dragon (1941) ran $100, 000 short of its production cost, contributing to the studio's financial woes. [clarification needed][70] While negotiations to end the strike were underway, Walt and studio animators embarked on a 12-week goodwill visit to South America, funded by the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. [71] During the trip, the animators began plotting films, taking inspiration from the local environments and music. [72] As a result of the strike, federal mediators compelled the studio to recognize the Screen Cartoonist's Guild and several animators left, leaving it with 694 employees. [73][68] To recover from financial losses, Disney rushed the studio's 4th animated feature Dumbo (1941) into production on a reduced budget; this performed well at the box office, infusing the studio with much needed cash. [61][74] After US entry into World War II, many of the company's animators were drafted into the army. [75] 500 United States Army soldiers occupied the studio for 8 months to protect a nearby Lockheed aircraft plant. While they were there, the soldiers fixed equipment in large soundstages and converted storage sheds into ammunition depots. [76] The United States Navy asked Disney to produce propaganda films to gain support for the war, and with the studio badly in need of profits, Disney agreed, signing a contract for 20 war-related shorts for $90, 000. [77] Most of the company's employees worked on the project, which spawned films such as Victory Through Air Power, and others which included some of the company's characters. [78][75] In August 1942, Disney released its fifth feature film, Bambi, after five years in development, and performed poorly at the box office. [79] Later, as products of the South American trip, Disney released the features Saludos Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944). [75][80] This was a new strategy of releasing package films, collections of short cartoons grouped to make feature films. Both performed poorly. Disney released more package films through the rest of the decade, including Make Mine Music (1946), Fun and Fancy Free (1947), Melody Time (1948), and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949), to try to recover from its financial losses. [75] Disney began producing less-expensive live-action films mixed with animation, beginning with Song of the South (1946) which would become one of Disney's most controversial films. [81][82] As a result of its financial problems, Disney began re-releasing its feature films in 1944. [82][83] In 1948, it began premiering the nature documentary series, True-Life Adventures, which ran until 1960, winning 8 Academy Awards. [84][85] In 1949, the Walt Disney Music Company was founded to help with profits for merchandising. [86] In the 1950s, Disney returned to producing full-length animated feature films, beginning with Cinderella (1950), its first feature in eight years. A critical and commercial success, Cinderella saved Disney after the financial pitfalls of the wartime era; it was its most financially successful film since Snow White, making $8 million in its first year. Walt began to reduce his involvement with animation, focusing his attention on the studio's increasingly diverse portfolio of projects, including live-action films (of which Treasure Island was the studio's first), television and amusement parks. [87][88] In 1950 the company made its first foray into television when NBC aired "One Hour in Wonderland", a promotional program for Disney's next animated film, Alice in Wonderland (1951), and sponsored by Coca-Cola. [89] Alice was financially unsuccessful, falling $1 million short of the production budget. [90] In February 1953, Disney's next animated film Peter Pan was released to financial success; [91] it was the last Disney film distributed by RKO after Disney ended its contract and created its own distribution company Buena Vista Distribution. [92] According to Walt, he first had the idea of building an amusement park during a visit to Griffith Park with his daughters. He said he watched them ride a carousel and thought there "should be . .. some kind of amusement enterprise built where the parents and the children could have fun together". [93][94] Initially planning the construction of an eight-acre (3. 2 ha) Mickey Mouse Park near the Burbank studio, Walt changed the planned amusement park's name to Disneylandia, then to Disneyland. [95] A new company, WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering), was formed in 1952 to design and construct the park. [96] Drawing inspiration from amusement parks in the US and Europe, Walt approached the design of Disneyland with an emphasis on thematic storytelling and cleanliness, innovative approaches for amusement parks of the time. [97][98] The plan to build the park in Burbank was abandoned when Walt realized 8 acres would not be enough to accomplish his vision. Disney acquired 160 acres (65 ha) of orange groves in Anaheim, southeast of LA in neighboring Orange County, at $6, 200 per acre to build the park. [99] Construction began in July 1954. To finance the construction of Disneyland, Disney sold his home at Smoke Tree Ranch in Palm Springs and the company promoted it with a television series of the same name aired on ABC. [100] The Disneyland television series, which would be the first in a long-running series of successful anthology television programs for the company, was a success and garnered over 50% of viewers in its time slot, along with praise from critics. [101] In August, Walt formed another company Disneyland, Inc. to finance the park, whose construction costs totaled $17 million. [102] In October, with the success of Disneyland, ABC allowed Disney to produce The Mickey Mouse Club, a variety show for children; the show included a daily Disney cartoon, a children's newsreel, and a talent show. It was presented by a host, and talented children and adults called "Mousketeers" and "Mooseketeers",

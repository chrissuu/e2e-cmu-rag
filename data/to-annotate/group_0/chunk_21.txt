percentage among Asian American religious groups. At the same time, 31% of Hindus also report attending religious services at least monthly. [87] Islam represents about 6% of Asian Americans, with an additional 3% expressing a cultural connection to the faith. South Asian Americans, predominantly those of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, account for the largest share of Muslims followed by those of Indian origin. [88] For many Asian American Muslims, religion plays a central role in daily life. About 60% report that religion is very important to them, and 54% attend mosque services at least monthly. This group also emphasises communal practices, with a strong focus on maintaining religious traditions within family and community settings. [88] Because Asian Americans or their ancestors immigrated to the United States from many different countries, each Asian American population has its own unique immigration history. [89] Filipinos have been in the territories that would become the United States since the 16th century. [90] In 1635, an "East Indian" is listed in Jamestown, Virginia; [91] preceding wider settlement of Indian immigrants on the East Coast in the 1790s and the West Coast in the 1800s. [92] In 1763, Filipinos established the small settlement of Saint Malo, Louisiana, after fleeing mistreatment aboard Spanish ships. [93] Since there were no Filipino women with them, these "Manilamen", as they were known, married Cajun and indigenous women. [94] Filipino farmworkers also played a major role in U. S. agriculture in the early 1900s. They often faced poor working conditions and discrimination. [citation needed] The first Japanese person to come to the United States, and stay any significant period of time was Nakahama Manjirō who reached the East Coast in 1841, and Joseph Heco became the first Japanese American naturalized US citizen in 1858. [95] Chinese sailors first came to Hawaii in 1789, [96] a few years after Captain James Cook came upon the island. Many settled and married Hawaiian women. Most Chinese, Korean and Japanese immigrants in Hawaii or San Francisco arrived in the 19th century as laborers to work on sugar plantations or construction place. [97] There were thousands of Asians in Hawaii when it was annexed to the United States in 1898. [98] Later, Filipinos also came to work as laborers, attracted by the job opportunities, although they were limited. [99] Ryukyuans would start migrating to Hawaii in 1900. [100] Many Chinese immigrants played key roles in building the Transcontinental Railroad, but their stories were often left out of mainstream history. According to a PBS article, “Descendants of Chinese Laborers Reclaim Railroad’s History, ” families today are working to recover and honor those forgotten histories. [101] Large-scale migration from Asia to the United States began when Chinese immigrants arrived on the West Coast in the mid-19th century. [102] Forming part of the California gold rush, these early Chinese immigrants participated intensively in the mining business and later in the construction of the transcontinental railroad. By 1852, the number of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco had jumped to more than 20, 000. A wave of Japanese immigration to the United States began after the Meiji Restoration in 1868. [103] In 1898, all Filipinos in the Philippine Islands became American nationals when the United States took over colonial rule of the islands from Spain following the latter's defeat in the Spanish–American War. [104] The PBS documentary series Asian Americans highlights these stories and explores how Asian American communities have shaped the U. S. across centuries. [105] Under United States law during this period, particularly the Naturalization Act of 1790, only "free white persons" were eligible to naturalize as American citizens. Ineligibility for citizenship prevented Asian immigrants from accessing a variety of rights, such as voting. [106] Bhicaji Balsara became the first known Indian-born person to gain naturalized US citizenship. [107] Balsara's naturalization was not the norm but an exception; in a pair of cases, Ozawa v. United States (1922) and United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923), the Supreme Court upheld the racial qualification for citizenship and ruled that Asians were not "white persons". Second-generation Asian Americans, however, could become US citizens due to the birthright citizenship clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; this guarantee was confirmed as applying regardless of race or ancestry by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). [108] From the 1880s to the 1920s, the United States passed laws inaugurating an era of exclusion of Asian immigrants. While the overall number of Asian immigrants was relatively small compared to those from other regions, their concentration in the West contributed to the rise of nativist sentiment, often referred to as the "yellow peril. " Congress passed restrictive legislation which prohibited nearly all Chinese immigration to the United States in the 1880s. [109] Japanese immigration was sharply curtailed by a diplomatic agreement in 1907. The Asiatic Barred Zone Act in 1917 further barred immigration from nearly all of Asia, the "Asiatic Zone". [110] The Immigration Act of 1924 provided that no "alien ineligible for citizenship" could be admitted as an immigrant to the United States, consolidating the prohibition of Asian immigration. [111] President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, resulting in the internment of Japanese Americans, among others. Over 100, 000 people of Japanese descent, mostly on the West Coast, were forcibly removed, in an action later considered ineffective and racist. [112] Japanese Americans were kept isolated in military camps just because of their race, including children, old persons and the young generation. 'Issei: The first generation' and 'Children of the camps' are two great documentaries representing the situation of Japanese Americans during World War II. World War II-era legislation and judicial rulings[which? ] gradually increased the ability of Asian Americans to immigrate and become naturalized citizens. Immigration rapidly increased following the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965 as well as the influx of refugees from conflicts occurring in Southeast Asia such as the Vietnam War. Asian American immigrants have a significant percentage of individuals who have already achieved professional status, a first among immigration groups. [113] The number of Asian immigrants to the United States "grew from 491, 000 in 1960 to about 12. 8 million in 2014, representing a 2, 597 percent increase. "[114] Asian Americans were the fastest-growing racial group between 2000 and 2010. [89][115] By 2012, more immigrants came from Asia than from Latin America. [116] In 2015, Pew Research Center found that from 2010 to 2015 more immigrants came from Asia than from Latin America, and that since 1965; Asians have made up a quarter of all immigrants to the United States. [117] Asians have made up an increasing proportion of the foreign-born Americans: "In 1960, Asians represented 5 percent of the U. S. foreign-born population; by 2014, their share grew to 30 percent of the nation's 42. 4 million immigrants. "[114] As of 2016, "Asia is the second-largest region of birth (after Latin America) of U. S. immigrants. "[114] In 2013, China surpassed Mexico as the top single country of origin for immigrants to the US. [118] Asian immigrants "are more likely than the overall foreign-born population to be naturalized citizens"; in 2014, 59% of Asian immigrants had US citizenship, compared

The library collection is particularly rich in material about the French and Indian
War and the history of Western Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley, as both William and
Mary Darlington researched and published in these areas. While the collection's main
focus is on American history and literature, other collection highlights include rare
maps and atlases, works on ornithology and natural history, and early travel narratives.
The Darlington's son, O'Hara Darlington, also amassed collections of Victorian literature
sporting books and works of illustrators and caricaturists. The collection also has
been enriched over the years by donations from other individuals and organizations,
which especially have enhanced its content about the history of the Western Pennsylvania
region. [74] Before renovation of the original library space, its materials were digitized
and placed online at The Darlington Digital Library. [75] The original, sometimes
fragile, materials of the library were placed in storage for availability to researchers
upon request. [76] A virtual tour of the Darlington Memorial Library as it previously
existed in the Cathedral of Learning is available at the main entrance[77] and the
main room. [78] Located on the fourth floor of the Cathedral of Learning, the current
home of both the Cultural Studies, Film Studies, and Gender, Sexuality, & Women's
Studies (GSWS) programs, [79] was the prior home of the McCarl Center for Nontraditional
Student Success until it moved to Wesley W. Posvar Hall in 2014. [80] The space occupies
what once housed two levels of the main stacks of the university's library. [81] The
2, 500-square-foot (230 m2) space was previously opened as the $537, 000 McCarl Center
in 2002. [82] Made possible by a gift from F. James and Foster J. J. McCarl, [82]
it was designed by Alan J. Cuteri and his architectural firm Strada, LLC, and includes
wood finishes, double-height spaces with high ceilings and windows, a main corridor
conceived as an interior street, and multiple elements that refer to the Cathedral
of Learning's Gothic architecture including decorative painted metal columns with
contemporary buttress-style arches. [18] Today the space includes a resource library,
offices, and seminar room, and class room that are used by the Cultural Studies and
GSWS programs. [79] Students in gender studies classes have access to the gender studies
library, which houses classic and recent books on gender/sexuality, and to two gender
studies classrooms. The GSWS faculty offices are also nearby. Also hanging in a hallway
on the fourth floor outside the space, three unsigned and undated 7-by-3-foot (2.
1 by 0. 9 m) glass-encased murals that depict Renaissance painting styles and which
have long belonged to the university but are of unknown origin. [83] Located in room
204, the walnut-paneled Mulert Memorial classroom was designed by Philadelphia architect
Gustav Ketterer and university architect Albert Klimcheck. [84] The room features
wood floors, fluted ionic columns, red velvet draperies, and student chairs with leather
seats. [85] The room's doors have fluted jams and panelings of Greek rosettes. A Mulert

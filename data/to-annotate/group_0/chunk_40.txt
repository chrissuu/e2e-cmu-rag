three faculties that together contain nine multi-disciplinary schools. The university offers over 200 programs[33] in 23 discipline areas. The field of peace studies has historically been a focus within UNE, commencing in 1982. [34] The University offers majors in peace studies at undergraduate level, as well as research higher degrees in peace studies. [35][36] UNE undertakes fundamental and applied research in many disciplines. Its scholars and scientists have established international reputations through their contributions in areas such as rural science, agricultural economics, educational administration, linguistics and archaeology. Collaborative research with other institutions includes projects with the CSIRO and the high-profile Cooperative Research Centres. Through its research UNE seeks to assist in the economic, social and cultural advancement of Australia and in the advanced training of undergraduate and postgraduate students. [40] UNE's principal research flagship is animal genetics and livestock breeding, which is serviced by the Animal Genetics and Breeding Unit (AGBU)[41] and delivered commercially by the Agricultural Business Research Institute (ABRI). Other research flagships include: Rural Education which is undertaken by the National Centre of Science, Information and Communication Technology, and Mathematics Education for Rural and Regional Australia (SiMERR)[42] Rural Communities, Landscapes and Practices which is led by the Institute for Rural Futures (IRF). [43] Other targeted areas of research include: [40] The Frank Archibald Memorial Lecture Series is named in honour of Frank Archibald, aka "Bubba", an Aboriginal man who was born in Oban, near Guyra, [44] around 1885[45] and died on 18 October 1975, aged an estimated 106 years old. He was the eldest grandson[44] of "King Robert"[45] (aka "King Bobby", [46] "King Malawangi", [47][48][49][50][51] "King Billy" or Robert/Billy/Bobby King), whose photo hangs in the Armidale Museum. [44] As a revered elder, Archibald could speak seven different Aboriginal languages and understand another two, as well as speaking English. His surname derives from his Scottish father. He was of the Gumbangeri people on his mother's side, but was also initiated into his wife Sarah Morris's people, the Dhungatti nation. A Catholic priest, Father Kelly, helped Archibald to build a house, completed in 1957, in which many relatives came to live. Archibald was revered by the Armidale Koori and community for his knowledge of so many Aboriginal issues, particularly in the education of his people and others. [44] The Frank Archibald Memorial Lecture was founded by Lynette Riley, [52] with the inaugural lecture given in 1986 by Eric Willmot. Since then, speakers have included: [44] In the Australian Financial Review Best Universities Ranking 2024, the university was ranked #34 amongst Australian universities. [62] In the 2026 Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings (published 2025), the university attained a position of #1001-1200 (35th nationally). [63] In the 2025â€“2026 U. S. News & World Report Best Global Universities, the university attained a tied position of #919 (33rd nationally). [64] In the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2024, [a] the university attained a position of #1088 (30th nationally). [65] The Australian Government's QILT[b] conducts national surveys documenting the student life cycle from enrolment through to employment. [66] These surveys place more emphasis on criteria such as student experience, graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction[66] than perceived reputation, research output and citation counts. [67] In the 2023 Employer Satisfaction Survey, graduates of the university had an overall employer satisfaction rate of 85. 9%. [68] In the 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey, graduates of the university had a full-time employment rate of 89. 2% for undergraduates and 90. 2% for postgraduates. [69] The initial full-time salary was A$75, 300 for undergraduates and A$87, 800 for postgraduates. [69] In the 2023 Student Experience Survey, undergraduates at the university rated the quality of their entire educational experience at 81. 4% meanwhile postgraduates rated their overall education experience at 78. 4%. [70] UNE's student body began in 1940, and is currently encapsulated by the University of New England Students' Association. [citation needed] Neucleus is a student newspaper published at the University of New England. The magazine was first printed in 1947 and is produced by University of New England Students' Association. [71] The University of New England has one of the most extensive residential college systems in Australia. Around half of UNE's on-campus students live in one of the colleges. [24] As at 2025, the residential colleges are: [72] As of 2011[update], more than 106, 000 people hold qualifications from UNE, with many in senior positions in Australia and overseas. [73] There is an active alumni network which contributes to the university, enabling the institution to continue expanding its work and offerings. [74] Notable alumni include: According to a 2017 Australian Human Rights Commission report based on optional surveys given to students, UNE had the highest reported rate of sexual assaults at universities in Australia, with 4% of respondents saying they had been sexually assaulted; the average rate across all universities was 1. 6%. [75][76] Under a previous 2016 freedom of information request UNE had reported there were 22 officially reported cases of sexual assaults on campus over the previous five years, resulting in two expulsions, no suspensions and seven warnings. [77] In February 2017 vice-chancellor Annabelle Duncan said that past UNE policies dealing with sexual harassment did not allow management to handle some cases satisfactorily. [78] On 1 August 2022, the incumbent Vice-Chancellor, Professor Brigid Heywood, was charged with allegedly assaulting a teenage girl at a club in Armidale on 8 March. Heywood was issued with an attendance notice to appear at Armidale Local Court on 26 September. [79] On 5 August, UNE accepted her resignation. [30]

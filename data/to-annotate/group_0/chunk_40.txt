College Green. The Scott Theatre is the largest lecture theatre on site and is often
hired out for performances of various kinds such as the Adelaide Fringe events. [132][133][134]
It features two revolving stages and a seating capacity of 635 people. [132] The Little
Theatre is located in the Cloisters and is primarily used for dramatic performances
by the Theatre Guild. [135][136][137] The College Green stretches from the Cloisters
across the lawns down to Victoria Drive, next to the River Torrens. [128][138] It
hosts various social events throughout the year including parties, live bands, DJs
and open-air cinema among others. [138][139][140] It was created in response to the
impact of social distancing restrictions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia,
which hit many live music venues. [139] The Napier and Ligertwood Buildings were built
following the demolition of the Jubilee Exhibition Building in 1962. [141][58] They
are named after Mellis Napier and George Ligertwood who were both former chancellors.
[142][143] The Mawson Building (originally Mawson Laboratories)[144] was named after
geologist and Antarctic explorer Sir Douglas Mawson, who taught at the university
from 1905 (professor from 1921) until his retirement in 1952. The building was completed
in 1953. [145] The Tate Museum, which houses the Mawson Institute for Antarctic Research
(founded 1959), [146] and Mawson Geo Centre are located in this building. [147] Some
other notable buildings include the Ingkarni Wardli Building, Darling Building, Hartley
Building, and the Helen Mayo North and South Buildings. [148][128] The A$100 million
Braggs Building, named after two Nobel laureates associated with the university, was
built in 2013 and features a large number of cross-disciplinary scientific research
facilities. [149][150] The Adelaide University Footbridge was constructed in 1937
following a decade of delays during the Great Depression. [151][152] The footbridge,
which crosses the River Torrens, features cast iron balustrading that is a popular
location for love locks. [153][154][151] The Adelaide University Union redevelopment,
also known as Union Buildings or Union Building Group, was completed in stages between
1967 and 1975. [155] It created some of the most significant buildings in the complex.
[156][157] The redevelopment was designed by lead architect Robert Dickson and includes
a heritage-listed group of buildings including the Union House, the Lady Symon Building
named after the wife of Josiah Symon, the George Murray Building, the Cloisters and
the Western Annexe. [158][159] The earlier Georgian-style buildings were designed
by the architects Woods, Bagot, Jory and Laybourne-Smith who also designed Bonython
Hall, the Mitchell Gates, the Johnson Laboratories, the Barr Smith Library, and the
Benham Laboratories. [159] The Adelaide University Union Cloisters were built in 1929
as a war memorial to the 470 University of Adelaide members who served during World
War I, of which 64 had died during the war. [160][161][162] There are three plaques
on the site, with the latest added in 2015 to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli
landing. [161] The university also has a presence in the adjacent Lot Fourteen precinct,

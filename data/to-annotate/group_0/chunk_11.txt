internally under the market system, many contracts would be required (for instance,
even for procuring a pen or delivering a presentation). In contrast, a real firm has
very few (though much more complex) contracts, such as defining a manager's power
of direction over employees, in exchange for which the employee is paid. These kinds
of contracts are drawn up in situations of uncertainty, in particular for relationships
that last over long periods of time. Such a situation runs counter to neo-classical
economic theory. The neo-classical market is instantaneous, forbidding the development
of extended agent-principal (employee-manager) relationships, planning, and of trust.
Coase concludes that "a firm is likely therefore to emerge in those cases where a
very short-term contract would be unsatisfactory", and that "it seems improbable that
a firm would emerge without the existence of uncertainty". He notes that government
measures relating to the market (sales taxes, rationing, price controls) tend to increase
the size of firms, since firms internally would not be subject to such transaction
costs. Thus, Coase defines the firm as "the system of relationships which comes into
existence when the direction of resources is dependent on the entrepreneur. " We can
therefore think of a firm as getting larger or smaller based on whether the entrepreneur
organises more or fewer transactions. The question then arises of what determines
the size of the firm; why does the entrepreneur organise the transactions he does,
why no more or less? Since the reason for the firm's being is to have lower costs
than the market, the upper limit on the firm's size is set by costs rising to the
point where internalising an additional transaction equals the cost of making that
transaction in the market. (At the lower limit, the firm's costs exceed the market's
costs, and it does not come into existence. ) In practice, diminishing returns to
management contribute most to raising the costs of organising a large firm, particularly
in large firms with many different plants and differing internal transactions (such
as a conglomerate), or if the relevant prices change frequently. Coase concludes by
saying that the size of the firm is dependent on the costs of using the price mechanism,
and on the costs of organisation of other entrepreneurs. These two factors together
determine how many products a firm produces and how much of each. [16] According to
Louis Putterman, most economists accept distinction between intra-firm and interfirm
transaction but also that the two shade into each other; the extent of a firm is not
simply defined by its capital stock. [17] George Barclay Richardson for example, notes
that a rigid distinction fails because of the existence of intermediate forms between
firm and market such as inter-firm co-operation. [18] Klein (1983) asserts that "Economists
now recognise that such a sharp distinction does not exist and that it is useful to
consider also transactions occurring within the firm as representing market (contractual)

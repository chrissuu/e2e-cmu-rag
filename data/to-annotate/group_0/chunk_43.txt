and was ordered to abstain from future university activities, following the university's
consultative procedures that include a faculty review committee. The results from
the investigation were compiled in a 97-page report, which included testimony from
victims of Ayala. [44][45][46][47][48] The layout of the core campus resembles a rough
circle with its center being Aldrich Park (initially known as Campus Park), lined
up by the Ring Mall and buildings surrounding the road. To further emphasize the layout,
academic units are positioned relative to the center, wherein undergraduate schools
are closer to the center than the graduate schools. [49] As of 2010, Aldrich Park
is planted with over 11, 120 trees (there are over 24, 000 trees on the entire campus),
including 33 species of eucalyptus. At the time, it was one of 74 campuses nationwide
to earn the designation of "Tree Campus USA" from the Arbor Day Foundation. [50] Two
ceremonial trees were planted in 1990, one for Arbor Day and the second for former
chancellor Daniel Aldrich who had died that year. On the first anniversary of the
September 11th tragedies, the chancellor planted a bay laurel tree in remembrance
of the heroes and victims of the events of September 11, 2001. The tree itself was
a gift from the UCI Staff Assembly. Aldrich Park is the site for "Wayzgoose", a medieval
student festival held each year in conjunction with the "Celebrate UCI" open house.
It also hosts many extracurricular activities. Ring Mall is the main pedestrian road
used by students and faculty to travel around the core campus. The road measures up
to a perfect mile and completely encircles Aldrich Park. [51] Most schools and libraries
orbit this road with each of these schools having their own central plaza which also
connects to the park. Other areas of the university outside of the core campus such
as the School of Arts are connected by four pedestrian bridges. Beyond the core campus
and the bridges, the layout of the campus is more suburban. Irvine, California consistently
ranks as the safest city in the United States. [52] UCI is close to the beaches, mountains,
and attractions of Southern California. Disneyland is approximately 20 minutes away
by car. While the university is located in Irvine, the campus is directly bounded
by the city of Newport Beach and the community of Newport Coast. The western side
of the campus borders the San Diego Creek and the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve,
through which Campus Drive connects UCI to the 405 freeway. The northern and eastern
sides of UCI are adjacent to Irvine proper; the eastern side of the campus is delineated
by Bonita Canyon Road, which turns into Culver Drive at its northern terminus. California
State Route 73 marks UCI's southern boundary and separates the campus from Newport
Beach. The "North Campus" houses the Facilities Management Department, the Faculty
Research Facility, Central Receiving, Fleet Services, the Air Pollution Health Effects

GNC Holdings, LLC (an initialism of General Nutrition Centers) is an American multinational retail and nutritional manufacturing company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. [5][6] It specializes in health and nutrition related products, including vitamins, supplements, minerals, herbs, sports nutrition, diet, and energy products. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbin Pharmaceutical Group, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical manufacturer. [7][8][9] In 1935, David Shakarian, an Armenian-American businessman, opened a small health food store originally named Lackzoom, in downtown Pittsburgh. He made $35 USD on his first day[10] and was able to open a second store within six months. Despite initial setbacks, such as the Ohio River flooding into downtown on St. Patrick's Day that wiped out both stores in 1936, Shakarian persevered and reopened the next year. He later expanded into mail-order sales of health foods, vitamins, and prescription drugs, capitalizing on the growing interest in physical fitness and health consciousness during the 1960s. [11][12] In the 1960s, the company changed the name of its stores to General Nutrition Centers. [13] Shakarian stepped down as chief executive officer in February 1984 but continued as chairman until his death later that year. [12] Shakarian took GNC public (listed on the NYSE) in the 1980s. Gary Daum was named chief executive office in February 1984. In May 1985, Jerry Horn took on the role. [14] GNC was taken private and sold to Thomas H.

In July 2019, it was announced that they planned to close up to 1, 400 company owned retail locations, primarily those located within shopping malls. [21] In June 2020, GNC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 Lockdowns and Stay-at-home orders that severely impacted store traffic; resulting in the closure of at least 800 stores. [22] Effective on June 30, 2020, the stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and shifted to the OTC Markets Group. [23] In September 2020, the bankruptcy court in Delaware approved the private sale of GNC for $770 million to Harbin Pharmaceutical Group and CITIC Capital. [24][25][26] In October 2020, Harbin Pharmaceutical Group, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical manufacturer, acquired the remainder of the company. [7][8][9] The company was sold under a private 363 sale thus cancelling the Chapter 11 process under the new ownership of Harbin Pharmaceutical Group in October 2020. [27] In 2021, GNC revealed that Josh Burris will take over as CEO, Nate Frazier as COO[28] and Cam Lawrence as CFO.

A major part of that was updating point-of-sale systems to allow for more in-store ordering, plus functions like loyalty programs. The newest version of the system also allows store associates to be able to sell outside of the store – such as going to a marathon, community event or parking lot tailgate, by utilizing mobile point-of-sale systems. In May 2025, U. S. representative Pat Harrigan introduced legislation that would prohibit GNC's presence on U. S. military bases. [33][34] GNC stores typically stock a wide range of weight loss, bodybuilding, nutritional supplements, vitamins, natural remedies, and health and beauty products, in both its owned brands as well as third-party brands.

[46][47] The company offers a turnkey business model that includes training, marketing support, and access to GNC's proprietary products. However, franchisees are required to pay an initial franchise fee, ongoing royalties, and adhere to certain operational standards. there are also some potential drawbacks to franchising with GNC. Franchisees are required to follow GNC's operational standards, which can limit their ability to innovate and differentiate themselves from other GNC locations. Additionally, ongoing royalties can eat into profit margins, and franchisees may be subject to additional fees for marketing and advertising support. Over the years many of GNC's Franchisees have excelled and have been recognized nationally for their success. In March of 2022 COO Nate Frazier Announced that Franchisee Laura Dalton had been recognized as the IFA Franchisee of the year. [48] GNC is

the first census (see also 1980) to show a decline in the combined total population of top ten cities, with 826, 495 ( 3. 8%) fewer people than the 1950 Census' top ten cities. The total population of these 10 cities was 20, 982, 889. The 1970 census was the nineteenth. The total population of these 10 cities was 22, 028, 346. By 1980, the population trends of urban decline and suburbanization that started in the 1950s were at their peak. This was the second census (see also 1960) to show a decline in the combined total population of the top ten cities, with 1, 142, 003 (5. 2%) fewer people than the 1970 Census' top ten cities, mostly due to the large drop in population of New York City. This is the first census in which half of the top ten cities are in the Sun Belt, specifically the West South Central and South Western area of the country. [24] The 1980 census was the twentieth. The total population of these 10 cities was 20, 886, 343. The 1990 Census was the Twenty-first. Continued trends of western cities' growth and Northeastern cities' contraction now place a majority of the top ten cities in the western portion of the Sun Belt, a regional concentration not seen since Northeastern cities dominated the top of the first seven censuses. [25] The total population of these 10 cities was 21, 872, 554. The 2000 census was the 22nd in U. S. history. The total population of these 10 cities was 23, 899, 236. Seven of the country's ten largest cities in 2010 were located in the Sun Belt region of the south and west, all of which have far lower population density than their earlier top-ranking counterparts. A different ranking is evident when considering U. S. metro area populations which count both city and suburban populations. The 2010 census was the twenty-third. The total population of these 10 cities was 24, 513, 008. 2020 is the first census in which all ten of the largest cities have populations of over one million. It is also the first census since 1940 in which no cities entered or left the top ten, and the first census since 1950 in which all ten cities gained population. This was the twenty-fourth census. The total population of these 10 cities was 26, 105, 017. Notes Sources

Interstate 35E running north–south and Interstate 94 running east–west. Trunk highways include U. S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 280, and Minnesota State Highway 5. Saint Paul has several unique roads, such as Ayd Mill Road, Phalen Boulevard, and Shepard Road/Warner Road, that diagonally follow particular geographic features in the city. Biking is also gaining popularity, due to the creation of more paved bike lanes that connect to other bike routes throughout the metropolitan area. [149] Downtown Saint Paul has a five-mile (8 km) enclosed skyway system over 25 city blocks. [150] The 563-mile (906 km) Avenue of the Saints connects Saint Paul with St. Louis, Missouri. The layout of city streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, [151] and remarked that the streets were designed by "drunken Irishmen". [152] He later apologized, though people had been complaining about the fractured grid system for more than a century by that point. [152] Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate. [153] Metro Transit provides bus service and light rail in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area. The METRO Green Line is an 11-mile (18 km) light rail line that connects downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis with 14 stations in Saint Paul. The Green Line runs west along University Avenue, through the University of Minnesota campus, until it links up and then shares stations with the METRO Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis. Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014. [154][155] The Green Line averaged 42, 500 rides per weekday in 2018. [156] Planning is underway for the Riverview Corridor, a rail line that will connect downtown Saint Paul to the airport and Mall of America. [157] The METRO A Line opened in 2016 as Minneapolis–Saint Paul's first arterial bus rapid transit line. The A Line connects the Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. [158] Future METRO lines are planned that will serve Saint Paul with the B Line and E Line Line running primarily on arterial streets, and the Gold Line and Purple Line running primarily in their own right of way. [159][160] Amtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle or Portland stops twice daily in each direction at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Depot. [161] Ridership on the train increased about 6% from 2005 to over 505, 000 in fiscal year 2007. [162] A Minnesota Department of Transportation study found that increased daily service to Chicago should be economically viable, especially if it originates in Saint Paul and does not experience delays from the rest of the western route of the Empire Builder. [163] Based on that proposition, a new Amtrak line, the Borealis, began service on May 21, 2024, running the segment of the Empire Builder route between Saint Paul and Chicago, with several stops along the way, including one in Milwaukee. [164] Saint Paul is the site of the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. [165] As of 2003, the yard handled over 1, 000 freight cars per day. [165] Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. [165] BNSF operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. [166] There are several other small yards around the city. Holman Airfield is across the river from downtown St. Paul. Lamprey Lake was there until the Army Corps of Engineers filled it with dredgings starting in the early 1920s. Northwest Airlines began initial operations from Holman in 1926. During WWII Northwest had a contract to install upgraded radar systems in B-24s, employing 5, 000 at the airfield. After WWII, Holman Airfield competed with the Speedway Field for the Twin Cities' growing aviation industry and lost out in the end. Today, Holman is a reliever airport run by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. It is home to Minnesota's Air National Guard and a flight training school and is tailored to local corporate aviation. There are three runways, with the Holman Field Administration Building and Riverside Hangar on the National Register of Historic Places. [167] The original Northwest Airlines building's historical importance was realized only after demolition commenced. For the most part, Saint Paul's aviation needs are served by the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), which sits on 2, 930 acres (11. 9 km2) in the Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory bordering the city to the southwest. MSP serves 17 commercial passenger airlines[168] and is the hub of Delta Air Lines and Sun Country Airlines.

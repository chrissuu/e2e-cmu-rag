persons, mostly children and their mothers, and injuring several hundred more. It occurred at a matinee performance of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus on Barbour Street in the city's north end and became known as the Hartford Circus Fire. [43] After World War II, many residents of Puerto Rico moved to Hartford. [44] Starting in the late 1950s, the suburbs ringing Hartford began to grow and flourish and the capital city began a long decline. Insurance giant Connecticut General (now CIGNA) moved to a new, modern campus in the suburb of Bloomfield. Constitution Plaza had been hailed as a model of urban renewal, but it gradually became a concrete office park. [45] Once-flourishing department stores shut down, such as Brown Thomson, Sage-Allen, and G. Fox & Co. , as suburban malls grew in popularity, such as Westfarms and Buckland Hills. [46] In 1997, the city lost its professional hockey franchise, with the Hartford Whalers moving to Raleigh, North Carolina—despite an increase in season ticket sales and an offer from the state for a new arena. [47] In 2005, a developer from Newton, Massachusetts tried unsuccessfully to bring an NHL team back to Hartford and house them in a new, publicly funded stadium. [48] Hartford experienced problems as the population shrank 11 percent during the 1990s. [49] Only Flint, Michigan; Gary, Indiana; St. Louis, Missouri; and Baltimore, Maryland experienced larger population losses during the decade. However, the population has increased since the 2000 Census. [50] In 1987, Carrie Saxon Perry was elected mayor of Hartford, becoming the first female African-American mayor of a major American city. [51] Riverfront Plaza was opened in 1999, connecting the riverfront and the downtown area for the first time since the 1960s. [52] A significant number of cultural events and performances take place every year at Mortensen Plaza (Riverfront Recapture Organization) by the banks of the Connecticut River. [53] These events are held outdoors and include live music, festivals, dance, arts and crafts. [53] Hartford also has a vibrant theater scene with major Broadway productions at the Bushnell Theater as well as performances at the Hartford Stage and TheaterWorks (City Arts). [54][55] In July 2017, Hartford considered filing Chapter 9 bankruptcy. After years of contending with a shrinking population base and high pension obligations, [56] a $65 million budget gap was projected for the year of 2018. [57] The city had cut budget of public services and gotten union concessions however these measures did not balance the budget. [56] A state bailout later that year kept the city from filing for bankruptcy. [58][59][60] Downtown Hartford is busy during the day with commuters, but tends to be quiet in the evenings and weekends. However, more residential and retail development in recent years has begun changing the pattern. [61] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 18. 0 square miles (47 km2), of which 17. 3 square miles (45 km2) is land and 0. 7 square miles (1. 8 km2) (3. 67%) is water. [62][63] The city of Hartford is bordered by the towns of West Hartford, Newington, Wethersfield, East Hartford, Bloomfield, South Windsor, Glastonbury, and Windsor. The Connecticut River forms the boundary between Hartford and East Hartford, and is located on the east side of the city. [64] The Park River originally divided Hartford into northern and southern sections and was a major part of Bushnell Park, but the river was nearly completely enclosed and buried by flood control projects in the 1940s. [65] The former course of the river can still be seen in some of the roadways that were built in the river's place, such as Jewell Street and the Conlin-Whitehead Highway. [66] The Köppen climate classification categorizes Hartford as the hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa) bordering on Cfa humid subtropical under the 0 °C isotherm. Winters are moderately cold, with periods of snow, while summers are hot and humid. Spring and fall are normally transition seasons, with weather ranging from warm to cool. The city of Hartford lies in USDA Hardiness zone 6b-7a. [67] Seasonally, the period from April through October is warm to hot in Hartford, with the hottest months being June, July, and August. In the summer months there is often high humidity and occasional (but brief) thundershowers. The cool to cold months are from November through March, with the coldest months in December, January, and February having average highs of 35 to 38 °F (2 to 3 °C) and overnight lows of around 18 to 23 °F (−8 to −5 °C). [68] The average annual precipitation is approximately 47. 05 inches (1, 200 mm), [69] which is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Hartford typically receives about 51. 7 inches (131 cm) of snow in an average winter—about 40% more than coastal Connecticut cities like New Haven, Stamford, and New London. [69] Seasonal snowfall has ranged from 115. 2 inches (293 cm) during the winter of 1995–96 to 13. 5 inches (34 cm) in 1999–2000. [70] During the summer, temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on an average of 17 days per year; [69] in the winter, overnight temperatures can dip to a range of 5 to −5 °F (−15 to −21 °C) on at least one night a year. Tropical storms and hurricanes have also struck Hartford, although the occurrence of such systems is rare and is usually confined to the remnants of such storms. Hartford saw extensive damage from the 1938 New England Hurricane, as well as with Hurricane Irene in 2011. The highest officially recorded temperature is 103 °F (39 °C) on July 22, 2011, and the lowest is −26 °F (−32 °C) on January 22, 1961; the record cold daily maximum is −2 °F (−19 °C) on December 2, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 80 °F (27 °C) on July 31, 1917. [69] The central business district, as well as the State Capitol, Old State House and a number of museums and shops are located Downtown. [75] Parkville, home to Real Art Ways, is named for the confluence of the north and the south branches of the Park River. [76] Frog Hollow, in close proximity to Downtown, is home to Pope Park and Trinity College, which is one of the nation's oldest institutions of higher learning. [77] Asylum Hill, a mixed residential and commercial area, houses the headquarters of several insurance companies as well as the historic homes of Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe. [78] The West End, home to the Governor's residence, Elizabeth Park, and the University of Connecticut School of Law, abuts the Hartford Golf Club. [79] Sheldon Charter Oak is renowned as the location of the Charter Oak and its successor monument as well as the former Colt headquarters including Samuel Colt's family estate, Armsmear. [80] The North East neighborhood is home to Keney Park and a number of the city's oldest and most ornate homes. [81] The South End features "Little Italy" and was the home of Hartford's sizeable Italian community. [82] South Green hosts Hartford Hospital. [83] The South Meadows is the site of Hartford–Brainard Airport and Hartford's industrial community. [84] The North Meadows

nearby particle physics laboratory. [77] It was also part of the Astrophysical Research
Consortium that constructed the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico. [98]
Faculty and students at the adjacent Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago collaborate
with the university. [99] In 2013, the university formed an affiliation with the formerly
independent Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass. [100] The National Opinion
Research Center maintains an office at the Hyde Park campus and is affiliated with
multiple academic centers and institutes. [101][102] The University of Chicago has
been the site of various experiments and academic movements. The university has played
a role in shaping ideas about the free market[103] and is the namesake of the Chicago
school of economics, the school of economic thought supported by Milton Friedman and
other economists. The university's sociology department was the first independent
sociology department in the United States and gave birth to the Chicago school of
sociology. [104] The university was the site of the Chicago Pile-1 (the first controlled,
self-sustaining human-made nuclear chain reaction, part of the Manhattan Project),
of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment that calculated the charge of the electron,
[105] and of the development of radiocarbon dating by Willard F. Libby in 1946. [106]
The chemical experiment that tested how life originated on early Earth, the Millerâ€“Urey
experiment, was also conducted at the university. [107] REM sleep was discovered at
the university in 1953 by Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky. [108] The University
of Chicago Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics operated the Yerkes Observatory
in Williams Bay, Wisconsin from 1897 until 2018, [109] where the largest operating
refracting telescope in the world and other telescopes are located. [110] The university
contains eight professional schools. The university runs a number of academic institutions
and programs apart from its undergraduate and postgraduate schools. It operates the
University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (a private day school for K-12 students and
day care), [132] and a public charter school with three campuses on the South Side
of Chicago administered by the university's Urban Education Institute. [133] In addition,
the Hyde Park Day School, a school for students with learning disabilities, [134]
and the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School, a residential treatment program for those
with behavioral and emotional problems, [135] maintains a location on the University
of Chicago campus. Since 1983, the University of Chicago has maintained the University
of Chicago School Mathematics Project, a mathematics program used in urban primary
and secondary schools. [136] The university runs a program called the Council on Advanced
Studies, which administers interdisciplinary workshops to provide a forum for graduate
students, faculty, and visiting scholars to present scholarly work in progress. [137]
The university also operates the University of Chicago Press, the largest university
press in North America. [138] The University of Chicago Library system encompasses
six libraries that contain a total of 11 million volumes, the 9th most among library
systems in the United States. [139] The university's primary library is the Regenstein

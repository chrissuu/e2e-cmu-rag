can be undertaken within an intensive four-week period. [368] Postgraduate students are only required to complete one core curriculum elective from the same options. [368] The Chaplaincy also runs study retreats each semester outside of its campuses. [379] These usually last four days during the pre-examination study week and allow students to prepare or work on assignments outside of the city centres. [379] The retreats also include scenic walks, social activities and time for prayer, sacraments and spiritual reflection. [379] For students in Perth, [379] study retreats are held at the New Norcia Benedictine Community in New Norcia located approximately 132 kilometres (82 miles) north of the city. [380] Founded in 1847 by Spanish Benedictine monks, it is the only monastic town in Australia[381] and is home to several heritage and religious sites. [382] For students in Sydney, [379] venues alternate between Mount Carmel Retreat Centre during the first semester[383] and the Hartzer Park Conference and Retreat Centre during the second. [384] The Mount Carmel Retreat Centre was founded in 1965 by Carmelitre Friars[385] and is located in Varroville on the outer fringes of Western Sydney. [386] The Hartzer Park Conference and Retreat Centre is a 6. 5-hectare (16-acre) site in Bowral, [387] a town in the Southern Highlands of regional New South Wales. [388] It is named after Marie Louise Hartzer, the first superior general of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, who have owned the site since 1947. [389] The Notre Dame Volunteer Network in Fremantle oversees volunteer projects in Perth and the surrounding area. [390] It connects staff and student volunteers to non-profit organisations in need of support. [390] Similar opportunities are also available to students in Sydney through partner organisations. [390] There is also a student mentorship program. [390] Students can also participate in the In Altum personal and career development program offered by the Chaplaincy. [391][370] It incorporates volunteering and leadership skills with the stated aim to help students "develop spiritually, to identify their own passions and gifts, and to serve the Church in a meaningful way". [392] The program involves contributing with Chaplaincy activities or a project of choice, attending formation sessions and group meetings, receiving mentorship from the Chaplaincy, taking part in a Chaplaincy Spiritual Retreat and committing to a personal prayer. [392][391] Personal projects can include liturgical activities, music ministry, organising events, leading small groups, community outreach, running movie and game nights or creating arts, crafts or other media. [392] The program lasts for one semester and runs outside of formal academic programs. [392] In Altum, from the Latin duc in altum, translates to "into the deep" or "into higher things" from Luke 5: 4. [391][392] It is a quote attributed to Jesus which is similar to the "give a man a fish" proverb but within a religious context. [393] In the 2023 academic year, Notre Dame had an enrolment of 11, 579 students divided between its three campuses including 4, 367 commencing students. [246] The equivalent full-time study load (EFTSL)[q] was 6, 486 for undergraduate students and 1, 884 for postgraduate students. [246] The student population is largely made up of domestic students, [m] with a total of 411 EFTSL international students. [246] These statistics don't take into account external students enrolled via Open Universities Australia. [246] Students identifying as Catholic have historically accounted for a majority of the student population, making up approximately 60% of those enrolled during the mid-2000s. [56] The Student Association of the University of Notre Dame Australia has two branches, each representing students in Perth or Sydney. [396][397] They operate both as the representative voice for students and as a provider of a wide range of services. [396][397] They are democratically controlled through General Meetings and elections, and are run by elected student officers. [396][397] The associations also support a range of services, including numerous clubs and societies, events, sports and advice services. [396][397] The Sydney branch of the Student Association of the University of Notre Dame Australia (SAUNDA) represents students at the Sydney sites meanwhile the Perth branch in Fremantle is abbreviated as the Notre Dame Student Association (NDSA). [396][397] Both associations have separate student-run clubs and societies, [398][399] and are governed independently. [396][397] Since mid-2024, both branches have been funded through the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF) similarly to other publicly funded universities in Australia. [400][401] For domestic students, it is deferable through a federal SA-HELP student loan and international students are able to apply for the Student Hardship Fund or other support services. [400] The timing of its introduction faced some criticism from students at the Fremantle campus during cost-of-living pressures and renovations deeming the main library closed. [402] As of 2025[update], there are 22 clubs and societies affiliated with the student association at the Sydney branch and 17 at the Perth branch. [398][399] Students can also organise new clubs and societies by registering them with the association, which is responsible for funding and monitoring their activities. [396][397] This approval process does not authorise them to act on behalf of the university or student association, nor does approval indicate their agreement with their purpose. [396][397] Additionally, the student association is responsible to ensure their compliance with the university objects and other policies. [396][397] During the 2010s, the university prevented student clubs supporting marriage equality from registering. [403][404] The ban was lifted in 2019 and the Stripes LGBTQ+ student club was founded that same year. [405] Quasimodo, preceded by The Ru'bric from 1996 to 1997, [406] was a student-run magazine at Notre Dame. [407] The magazine took its name from Quasimodo, Victor Hugo's fictional bell-ringer and protagonist of The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. [406] In 2005, former editor Chris Bailey charged that the university's Catholic hierarchy sought to restrict the range of topics discussed in the magazine, including "abortion, contraception and gay unions". [407] Future issues were vetted by a review committee of university and student representatives â€“ "Quasimodo now is very much G-rated" as a result, Bailey claimed, with censorship "being extended to include most sexual references, profane language and even criticism of the university". [407] One issue of the magazine, containing an article on the morning-after pill, was banned by then vice-chancellor Peter Tannock, with Bailey claiming that he and other contributors were "unofficially told by university staff that students involved in defying the university may be kicked out of uni. "[407] Tannock later stated that academic freedom, including "a fair bit" of supposed anti-Catholic activity, would be respected at the religious institution when it sought to open a medical school that year. [56] The university also ran its own publications including In Principio, [r] a former bi-annual university magazine, [408] and a small number of open access journals with varying levels of activity. [409] The Notre Dame Knights[410] compete in inter-university fixtures in the UniSport Nationals competition in a range of sports, including beach volleyball, futsal, golf, hockey, netball, rowing, squash, ten-pin bowling, touch football and volleyball among other events. [411] It also competes in the state-level NSW Intervarsity in New South Wales[411] and the Western Series in Western Australia. [412] The university is also a member of the Elite Athlete University Network and provides additional adjustment factors,

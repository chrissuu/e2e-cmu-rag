but only some of those tartans have been officially adopted or recognised by the relevant
governments in Australia. US states have official tartans, with the first dating from
1988. A tartan is sometimes differentiated from another with the same name by a label:
hunting, mourning, dress, or dance. The first three of these ideas are the result
of Victorian fondness for dress etiquette and show[911] (and weaver marketing); [66]
the last is more recent. Hunting tartans tend to be made up of subdued colours, such
as dark blues, greens, and browns. [912] Although there is some evidence of early
tartans with camouflage colours going back to the 16th century, hunting tartans, despite
the name, have very little to do with actual hunting. [12] Mourning tartans, though
quite rare, are associated with death and funerals. They are usually designed using
combinations of black and white, or by replacing bright colours such as reds and yellows
in a traditional tartan with black, white, or grey. [913] Dress tartans are usually
special tartans for formal-dress occasions[914] (e. g. dress Stewart[915] is distinct
from both the main royal Stewart tartan and the hunting Stewart, [916] among several
other tartans attributed to Stewart/Stuart). In a few cases, a dress tartan is simply
the main tartan of the clan. [cy] Dress tartans that do differ from main clan tartans
are sometimes entirely different (e. g. MacMillan[36] and MacMillan dress[921] are
unrelated designs), while in most cases they are based on the main tartan but with
colour differences (e. g. Stewart). Some dress tartans are very modern, [82][624]
but some date back to the era of the Vestiarium Scoticum. [922] Dance tartans, intended
for Highland dance outfits, for either sex, are inspired (like most dress tartans
before them) by the arisaid (earasaid tartans thought to have been worn by Highland
women in the 17th and 18th centuries, which often featured white as a major colour,
as do typical dance tartans today (most or all of which date to the 20th century or
later). Some dance tartans are named "arisaid" rather than "dance", e. g. Fraser arisaid.
[923][cz] There has been some confusion between dress and dance tartans, especially
since the idea of the latter developed from the former. [da] Most dress tartans, including
some of the oldest, also have white in them, and have been used for dance competition
in lieu of a dance-specific tartan, so are easy to mistake for dance tartans, which
almost invariably have white in them. [926][db] A large proportion of non-clan tartans
in all of the modern tartan databases have always been family tartans, promulgated
mostly from the late 20th century for family names that are not clans or listed as
septs of clans. These are usually Scottish surnames, but the Scottish Register of
Tartans (SRT) database increasingly includes new family tartans for names that are
not Scottish or even British. Most family tartans have no copyright claim, since they

Boeing airliners, the 787 uses a yoke (as opposed to a side-stick). Under consideration is the future integration of forward-looking infrared into the HUD for thermal sensing, allowing pilots to "see" through clouds. [4] Lockheed Martin's Orion spacecraft will use a glass cockpit derived from Honeywell International's 787 flight deck systems. [252] Honeywell and Rockwell Collins provide flight control, guidance, and other avionics systems, including standard dual head-up guidance systems, [4] Thales supplies the integrated standby flight display and power management, [4] while Meggitt/Securaplane provides the auxiliary power unit (APU) starting system, electrical power-conversion system, and battery-control system[253][254] with lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) batteries by GS Yuasa. [255][256] One of the two batteries weighs 28. 5 kg and is rated 29. 6 V, 76 Ah, giving 2. 2 kWh. [257] Battery charging is controlled by four independent systems to prevent overcharging, following early lab testing. [258] The battery systems were the focus of a regulatory investigation due to multiple lithium battery fires, which led to the grounding of the 787 fleet starting in January 2013. [259] A version of Ethernet (Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) / ARINC 664) transmits data between the flight deck and aircraft systems. [260] The control, navigation, and communication systems are networked with the passenger cabin's in-flight internet systems. [261] In January 2008, FAA concerns were reported regarding possible passenger access to the 787's computer networks; Boeing has stated that various protective hardware and software solutions are employed, including air gaps to physically separate the networks, and firewalls for software separation. [261][262] These measures prevent data transfer from the passenger internet system to the maintenance or navigation systems. [261] The -9/10 hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) system delays the critical transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far back as possible on the vertical tail by passive suction from leading-edge holes to mid-fin low-pressure doors but was dropped from the tailplane due to lower benefits than the extra complexity and cost. [263] The 787 is the first commercial aircraft to have an airframe majority made of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), applied in: the empennage, fuselage, wings, doors, and in most other main components. [264] Each 787 contains approximately 77, 000 lb (35 t) of CFRP, made with 51, 000 lb (23 t) of pure carbon fiber. [265] CFRP materials have a higher strength-to-weight ratio than conventional aluminum structural materials, which contributes significantly to the 787's weight savings, [234] as well as superior fatigue behavior. [266] Historically, the first CFRP primary structure in Boeing commercial aircraft was put into service in 1984 on the horizontal tail of the Boeing 737 Classic, and in the mid-1990s on both vertical and horizontal tail (empennage) of the Boeing 777. [267] In the early 2000s, while studying the proposed Sonic Cruiser, Boeing built and tested the first CFRP fuselage section for commercial aircraft, to evaluate materials and manufacturing techniques which later applied to the Dreamliner. [268][269] Instead of designing one-piece composite fuselage barrels like the 787, the competing Airbus A350 uses a slightly more conventional approach with CFRP panels on CFRP frames, which is considered less risky in terms of assembly tolerance between fuselage sections. [89] Safety can be a concern due to lower impact energy absorption and poorer fire, smoke and toxicity capability of CFRP fuselages in the event of a crash landing, leading to whistleblower complaints at Boeing by Vince Weldon, who was fired in 2006. [270][88] The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) later denied Weldon whistleblower status "largely on the grounds that Boeing's 787 design does not violate any FAA regulations or standards". [270] Boeing further argued that CFRP structures have been used on empennages and other parts of airliners for many years without incident, and special damage detection procedures will be instituted for the 787 to detect any potential hidden damage. [271] In the fall of 2004, 787 engineering program leader Walt Gillette made the final decision to use CFRP for the 787’s fuselage, a first for a commercial aircraft. Two distinct Boeing sub-groups with expertise in two different materials—CFRP and aluminum alloy—spent months researching how their material would perform for the 787. [272] Therefore, a "fundamental philosophical dichotomy" existed in the group. This is why a single "collaborative" leader rather than the group needed to make the final call on the material. [273] In 2006, Boeing launched the 787 GoldCare program. [274] This is an optional, comprehensive life-cycle management service, whereby aircraft in the program are routinely monitored and repaired, as needed. Although the first program of its kind from Boeing, post-sale protection programs are not new; such programs are usually offered by third party service centers. Boeing is also designing and testing composite hardware so inspections are mainly visual. This reduces the need for ultrasonic and other non-visual inspection methods, saving time and money. [275] The Boeing 787 is equipped with two flight recorders—a Forward Flight Recorder (FWD FR) and an Aft Flight Recorder (AFT FR)—each of which units provides the functions traditionally provided by the Flight Data Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder. [276] The 787-8 is designed to typically seat 234 passengers in a three-class setup, 240 in two-class domestic configuration, and 296 passengers in a high-density economy arrangement. Seat rows can be arranged in four to seven abreast in first or business—e. g. , 1–⁠2–⁠1, 2–⁠2–⁠2, or 2–⁠3–⁠2. Eight or nine abreast are options in economy—e. g. , 2–⁠4–⁠2 or 3–⁠3–⁠3. Typical seat room ranges from 46 to 61 in (120 to 150 cm) pitch in first, 36 to 39 in (91 to 99 cm) in business, and 32 to 34 in (81 to 86 cm) in economy. [277][278] Cabin interior width is approximately 18 feet (550 cm) at armrest level. [277][279] The Dreamliner's cabin width is 15 inches (38 cm) more than that of the Airbus A330 and A340, [280] 5 inches (13 cm) less than the A350, [281] and 16 in (41 cm) less than the 777. [282] The 787's economy seats can be up to 17. 5 in (44. 4 cm) wide for nine-abreast seating[283] and up to 19 inches (48 cm) wide for eight-abreast seating arrangements. Most airlines are selecting the nine-abreast (3–3–3) configuration. [284][285] The 787's nine-abreast seating for economy provides passengers less space, particularly across the hips and shoulders, than any other jet airliner. [286] Some observers recommended passengers avoid flying 787s with nine-abreast seating, [286][287] although others suggested that the 787 is more comfortable than other airliners. [288] The 787's cabin windows have dimensions of 10. 7 by 18. 4 in (27 by 47 cm), [289] and a high eye level so passengers can maintain a view of the horizon. [290] The composite fuselage permits larger windows without the need for structural reinforcement. [291] Instead of plastic window shades, the windows use electrochromism-based smart glass (supplied by PPG Industries)[292] allowing flight attendants[293] and passengers to adjust five levels of sunlight and visibility to their liking, [294] reducing cabin glare while maintaining a view to the outside world, [290][295] but the most opaque setting still has some transparency. [293][296] While the lavatory window also uses smart glass, it was given a traditional sunshade. [294] The 787's cabin features light-emitting diodes (LEDs)[297] as standard equipment,

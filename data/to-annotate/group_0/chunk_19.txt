because it is more welcoming within the cultural and community. [258] Counselors are
encouraged to be aware of such barriers for the well-being of African American clients.
Without cultural competency training in health care, many African Americans go unheard
and misunderstood. [255] In 2021, African Americans had the third highest suicide
rate trailing American Indians/Alaska Natives and White Americans. However, African
Americans had the second highest increase of its suicide rate from 2011 to 2021, growing
58%. [259] As of 2024, suicide is the second leading cause of death among African-Americans
between the ages of 15 and 24, with Black men being four times more likely to kill
themselves than Black women. [260] Recent studies of African Americans using genetic
testing have found ancestry to vary by region and sex of ancestors. These studies
found that on average, African Americans have 73. 2–82. 1% Sub-Saharan African, 16.
7–24% European, and 0. 8–1. 2% Native American genetic ancestry, with large variation
between individuals. [262][263][264] Commercial testing services have reported similar
variation, with ranges from 0. 6 to 2 percent Native American, 19 to 29 percent European,
and 65 to 80 percent Sub-Saharan African ancestry. [265] According to a genome-wide
study by Bryc et al. (2009), the mixed ancestry of African Americans in varying ratios
came about as the result of sexual contact between West/Central Africans (more frequently
females) and Europeans (more frequently males). This can be understood as being the
result of enslaved African American females being raped by White males. [266] Consequently,
the 365 African Americans in their sample have a genome-wide average of 78. 1% West
African ancestry and 18. 5% European ancestry, with large variation among individuals
(ranging from 99% to 1% West African ancestry). The West African ancestral component
in African Americans is most similar to that in present-day speakers from the non-Bantu
branches of the Niger-Congo family. [262][note 2] Correspondingly, Montinaro et al.
(2014) observed that around 50% of the overall ancestry of African Americans traces
comes from a population similar to the Niger-Congo-speaking Yoruba of southern Nigeria
and southern Benin, reflecting the centrality of this West African region in the Atlantic
slave trade. The next most frequent ancestral component found among African Americans
was derived from Great Britain, in keeping with historical records. It constitutes
a little over 10% of their overall ancestry and is most similar to the Northwest European
ancestral component also carried by Barbadians. [268] Zakharia et al. (2009) found
a similar proportion of Yoruba-like ancestry in their African American samples, with
a minority also drawn from Mandenka and Bantu populations. Additionally, the researchers
observed an average European ancestry of 21. 9%, again with significant variation
between individuals. [261] Bryc et al. (2009) note that populations from other parts
of the continent may also constitute adequate proxies for the ancestors of some African
American individuals; namely, ancestral populations from Guinea Bissau, Senegal and
Sierra Leone in West Africa and Angola in Southern Africa. [262] An individual African

of the Year, Jeff Mountain entered his 19th season at W&J in 2021. Mountain has compiled
a 496-266-2 record during his tenure with the Presidents. The men's basketball team
was founded in 1913. [28] In the 1930s and 1940s, the team played at Washington High
School and regularly beat teams like West Virginia University, Penn State, Navy, Carnegie
Tech, and Villanova. [29] The team received an invitation to the 1943 National Invitation
Tournament, where, as the 8th seed, they defeated the top seed Creighton University
at Madison Square Garden by a score of 43–42. After losing to Toledo in the semi-final
round, W&J defeated Fordham 39–34 to take the third place in the tournament. [30]
Three W&J alumni went on to professional basketball careers, including Hal Tidrick,
Harry Zeller, and Buddy Jeannette. [31] Jeanette was elected to the Basketball Hall
of Fame in 1994. [32] The football team competes in the NCAA Division III and is affiliated
with the Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC). [33] Since its founding in 1890, the
team has played their home games at Cameron Stadium. [33] A number of players were
named to the College Football All-America Team, and two players, Pete Henry and Edgar
Garbisch have been elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. [33] Several other
former players have gone on to play professionally, including "Deacon" Dan Towler,
Russ Stein, and Pete Henry, who was also elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame
and the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team. [33] The team has been coached by some of the greatest
coaches in football history, including John Heisman, Greasy Neale, and Bob Folwell.
[33] The team was founded in 1890, quickly becoming well known for drawing large crowds
and defeating a number of prominent football teams. [34] The faculty and administration
expressed concern over the strength of the team and made efforts to reduce the influence
of professionalism on the players. [35] During the 1910s, some sportswriters were
suggesting that the Presidents were one of the top teams in the nation. [36] The biggest
achievement in the team's history came in 1921, when the Presidents were chosen to
play in 1922 Rose Bowl, playing the heavily favored California Golden Bears to a scoreless
tie. [37] The Red and Black finished the season with a share of the 1921 national
championship, as named by the Boand System. [38] As college football developed in
the 1930s and 1940s, the Presidents fell far behind their larger competitors, who
were able to offer scholarships for their players. [39] Controversy over the poor
play of the football team, and a lack of play against larger teams, contributed to
the resignation of a college president. [40] By the 1950s, the team joined the NCAA
Division III and the Presidents' Athletic Conference. [41] By the 1980s, the team
had learned to thrive in that environment, winning a number of conference championships
and regularly qualifying for the NCAA Division III playoffs. [42][43] W&J finished

in the United States, accusing him of obtaining the Ecuadorian judgment through bribery and fraud. A key witness in Chevron's US case against Donziger, Alberto Guerra, later admitted under oath in an international tribunal that Chevron had paid him substantial sums (reportedly over $1 million and ongoing benefits) to provide false testimony against Donziger, requiring extensive coaching over 50 days. The US case against Donziger was overseen by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who critics note had financial ties to Chevron. When Donziger appealed Kaplan's order to turn over his computer and phone citing attorney-client privilege, Kaplan referred the matter for criminal contempt charges. After the US Attorney's office declined to prosecute, Judge Kaplan appointed a private law firm, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher (which has represented Chevron), to prosecute Donziger in the court's name â€“ an unusual move described as the first corporate criminal prosecution in US history. Donziger was subsequently placed under house arrest for 993 days while awaiting trial on the misdemeanor charge. He was ultimately convicted of contempt of court and served time in prison, receiving a sentence critics claim exceeded the legal maximum for the offense. As a result of these legal battles, Donziger was disbarred, had his bank accounts frozen, and reportedly faces ongoing restrictions preventing him from working, holding accounts, or leaving the US. Chevron also sued Donziger for $60 billion, described as the largest amount sought from an individual in US history. Critics assert that Chevron's actions against Donziger were intended to make an example of him and deter other lawyers from challenging the company over environmental damages worldwide. Concerns have also been raised about Chevron's oil extraction activities in urban settings like Los Angeles. Observers note the presence of active oil wells located directly adjacent to homes and schools, particularly in lower-income areas. In wealthier neighborhoods, such as Beverly Hills, Chevron allegedly camouflages its drilling operations within large, windowless structures designed to look like ordinary office buildings or service facilities, hiding numerous wells from public view. One such disguised oil pump at Beverly Hills High School, dubbed the "Tower of Hope, " reportedly drew attention only after it caught fire. Furthermore, Chevron is accused of improperly abandoning depleted wells in the city, leaving behind toxic sites that pose ongoing health risks (such as nosebleeds or respiratory issues) to nearby residents and can potentially lead to hazardous events like eruptions of toxic sludge. Critics argue that, similar to the situation in Ecuador, regulatory oversight in these areas appears insufficient to prevent these practices or hold the company accountable for remediation. Critics argue that these incidents reflect a broader business model employed by Chevron and other large resource extraction companies. This alleged model involves entering countries, extracting resources as cheaply as possible (often with minimal environmental safeguards), dumping waste products to cut costs, and leaving local communities to deal with the long-term environmental and health consequences. The company is accused of using its significant financial and legal resources (employing thousands of lawyers and spending billions on litigation in the Ecuador case) to overwhelm opponents, delay legal proceedings, influence governments, and avoid accountability for damages caused by its operations globally.

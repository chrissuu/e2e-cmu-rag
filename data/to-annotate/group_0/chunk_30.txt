freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was
between 29 and 34. [120] In the 2020â€“2021 academic year, 24 freshman students were
National Merit Scholars. [121] The university uses capacity constrained majors, [122]
a gate-keeping process that requires most students to apply to an internal college
or faculty. New applications are usually considered once or twice annually, and few
students are admitted each time. [123] The screening process is based on cumulative
academic performance, recommendation letters and extracurricular activities. [124]
UW's research budget surpassed the $1. 0 billion research budget milestone in 2012,
[129] and university endowments reached almost $5. 0 billion by 2021. [130] In 2014,
the University of Washington School of Oceanography and the UW Applied Physics Laboratory
completed the construction of the first high-power underwater cabled observatory in
the United States. Gabrielle Rocap, one of the researchers who discovered arsenic-breathing
microbes in the Pacific, is part of the department's faculty. [131] To promote equal
academic opportunity, especially for people of low income, UW launched Husky Promise
in 2006. Families of income up to 65 percent of state median income or 235 percent
of the federal poverty level are eligible. With this, up to 30 percent of undergraduate
students may be eligible. The cut-off income level that UW set is the highest in the
nation, making top-quality education available to more people. UW President Mark Emmert
said that being "elitist is not in our DNA". [132][133] UW was the host university
of ResearchChannel program (now defunct), the only TV channel in the United States
dedicated solely for the dissemination of research from academic institutions and
research organizations. [134] Participation of ResearchChannel included 36 universities,
15 research organizations, two corporate research centers and many other affiliates.
[135] Alan Michelson, now Head of the Built Environments Library at UW Seattle, manages
the Pacific Coast Architecture Database (PCAD), which Michelson started in 2002 while
he worked as Architecture and Design Librarian at the University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA). The PCAD serves as a searchable public database detailing significant
but importantly, also lesser-known and -lauded designers, buildings and structures,
and partnerships, with links including to bibliographic literature. [136] In 2019,
iDefense reported that Chinese hackers had launched cyberattacks on dozens of academic
institutions in an attempt to gain information on technology being developed for the
United States Navy. [137] Some of the targets included the University of Washington.
[137] The attacks have been underway since at least April 2017. [137] The University
of Washington had 50, 097 total enrollments as of fall 2023, making it the largest
university on the West Coast by student population in spite of its selective admissions
process. [139] It also boasts one of the most diverse student bodies within the US,
with more than 50% of its undergraduate students self-identifying with minority groups.
[140][141][113][142] The University of Washington boasts over 800 active Registered
Student Organizations (RSOs), one of the largest networks of any universities in the

about where the company stands on freedom of speech. [369] Following public outcry,
Twitter restored the accounts the next day without explaining why the accounts had
been suspended. [370] The same day, Twitter, along with Facebook, Google, and Microsoft,
jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review "[the]
majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech" posted on their
services within 24 hours. [371] In August 2016, Twitter stated that it had banned
235, 000 accounts over the past six months, bringing the overall number of suspended
accounts to 360, 000 accounts in the past year, for violating policies banning use
of the platform to promote extremism. [372] On May 10, 2019, Twitter announced that
they suspended 166, 513 accounts for promoting terrorism in the July–December 2018
period, saying there was a steady decrease in terrorist groups trying to use the platform
owing to its "zero-tolerance policy enforcement". According to Vijaya Gadde, Legal,
Policy and Trust and Safety Lead at Twitter, there was a reduction of 19% terror related
tweets from the previous reporting period (January–June 2018). [373][374][375][376][377]
As of July 30, 2020, Twitter will block URLs in tweets that point to external websites
that contain malicious content (such as malware and phishing content) as well as hate
speech, speech encouraging violence, terrorism, child sexual exploitation, breaches
of privacy, and other similar content that is already banned as part of the content
of tweets on the site. Users that frequently point to such sites may have their accounts
suspended. Twitter said this was to bring their policy in line to prevent users from
bypassing their tweet content restrictions by simply linking to the banned content.
[378] After the onset of protests by Donald Trump's supporters across the US in January
2021, Twitter suspended more than 70, 000 accounts, stating that they shared "harmful
QAnon-associated content" at a large scale, and were "dedicated to the propagation
of this conspiracy theory across the service". [379] One of the accounts suspended
was then-former-president Trump's account; in February 2025, Twitter settled a lawsuit
filed by Trump in response to his suspension paying Trump approximately $10 million.
[380] Between January and late July 2017, Twitter had identified and shut down over
7, 000 fake accounts created by Iranian influence operations. [381] In May 2018, in
response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence
elections, Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization
Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates
running for election in the U. S. [382][383] In December 2019, Twitter removed 5,
929 accounts for violating their manipulation policies. The company investigated and
attributed these accounts to a single state-run information operation, which originated
in Saudi Arabia. The accounts were reported to be a part of a larger group of 88,
000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior. However, Twitter did not disclose all of

FC. [47] The Republic concluded their inaugural season by winning the Championship and nearly doubling the league's average attendance record. [48][49][50] The Eagles and Lions exited for the PDL, [51] while Orlando City became the fifth USL club to gain promotion to the MLS. [52][53][54] Upon their exit, the Eagles and Orlando City sold their franchise rights to the Charlotte Independence and Louisville City FC respectively. [55][56] The two clubs began play in the 2015 season of the USL, which dropped "Pro" from its name, alongside Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC, Saint Louis FC, and the Tulsa Roughnecks. [57] A new Austin Aztex also joined, but entered a hiatus after the season due to financial troubles caused by a historic flood that damaged their home ground. [58][59] Inspired by the Galaxy, seven more MLS clubs fielded reserve teams into the USL, amid the demise of the MLS Reserve League. [60][61] The unprecedented growth from 13 to 24 teams necessitated the introduction of the "Eastern" and "Western" conferences, where teams played 22 intraconference and six interconference games, [62] and inspired the USL to apply for D2 status in early 2015. [57] The Rhinos broke all-time USL records for shutouts (17) and fewest goals allowed (15) on their way to their fourth and final USL title. [63][64] Three more MLS reserve teams entered in the 2016 season, [65][66][67] alongside San Antonio FC, [68] MLS expansion bidders FC Cincinnati, [69] and Rio Grande Valley FC Toros – a "hybrid" club with independent ownership, but managed by the MLS's Houston Dynamo FC. [70][71][72] Cincinnati's inaugural season yielded three all-time USL records for single-match attendance, with the highest being 24, 376. [73][74] The New York Red Bulls II became the first MLS reserve team to win a USL title. [75] The Hammerheads left for the PDL, despite a move to Baltimore, Maryland being reportedly planned by the club. [76][77] Seeking to arrest financial losses incurred while playing in the NASL, the Ottawa Fury and Tampa Bay Rowdies defected to the USL ahead of the 2017 season, [78][79] triggering a revocation of the NASL's D2 status, as its membership fell below the twelve required. As an interim solution, U. S. Soccer awarded a provisional D2 status to both the NASL and USL. [80][81] Reno 1868 FC also joined, [82] while the Montreal Impact folded their reserve team for a Fury affiliation. [83] Arizona United SC rebranded as Phoenix Rising FC, following its sale to an ownership group that included Premier League Hall of Famer Didier Drogba, who also signed for the club. [84][85][86] Louisville City won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018 – the latter by defeating the Rising in Drogba's final professional game. [87][88][89] At the end of 2017, the Rhinos entered a hiatus in an attempt to shore up new investors, [90][91] while Orlando City B (OCB) went on hiatus due to a lack of players and staff. [92] For the 2018 season, the USL gained full D2 status, while the NASL was stripped of theirs. [93] A preliminary injunction against the decision was denied, leading to the NASL's collapse, and its clubs scattering. [94][95][96] Two of them, Indy Eleven and North Carolina FC, [97][98] joined the USL alongside Fresno FC, Las Vegas Lights FC, [99][100] and MLS expansion bidders Nashville SC. [101] A fifth NASL club, San Diego 1904 FC, were denied entry as concerns arose over its ownership, home ground, and lack of local investment. [102][103] Atlanta United entered their reserve team, while the Vancouver Whitecaps folded theirs for a Fresno affiliation. [104][105] The Islanders rebranded as Penn FC. [106] Having won their bid to enter the MLS, [107] Cincinnati's final season set all-time USL records for single-match attendance (31, 478), average attendance (25, 717), and total attendance (437, 197). [108][109][110] After a decade playing as a single league, the USL returned to a two-division structure in the 2019 season. It rebranded its D2 league as the USL Championship and introduced a new D3 league, USL League One, [111] to which the Kickers, OCB, Penn, Rhinos, and Toronto FC II moved. [112][113][114] D. C. United's Loudoun United FC became the league's final MLS reserve team, [115] entering alongside Birmingham Legion FC, [116] El Paso Locomotive FC, [117] Hartford Athletic, [118] Memphis 901 FC, [119] and New Mexico United. [120] The Aztex returned from its hiatus after rebranding as Austin Bold FC. [121][122] Real Monarchs became the second and last MLS reserve team to win a USL title, [123][124] while New Mexico's successful debut earned the season's highest average attendance. [125][126] Having won their bid to join, Nashville became the seventh USL club to move to MLS. [127] Fresno went on hiatus after stadium plans fell through, [128] and the Fury folded after Concacaf and U. S. Soccer denied them permission to continue play in an American league. [129] Their franchise rights were sold to Miami FC, a National Independent Soccer Association (NISA) club that first played in the NASL. [130][131] San Diego Loyal SC began play in the 2020 season. [132] Saint Louis FC folded at the end of the 2020 season. At the time, the city was set to receive an MLS franchise, with St. Louis City SC ultimately starting play in 2023. A spokesperson for SLFC told Sports Illustrated in August 2020, "The ownership decided that with the financial impact of COVID-19 and MLS on the horizon, it didn't make sense to continue operations. "[133] Also at the end of the 2020 season, two MLS clubs, the Philadelphia Union and Portland Timbers, withdrew their reserve sides, Philadelphia Union II and Portland Timbers 2, from the United Soccer League system. [134] An expansion team was announced for the New York City borough of Queens to be named Queensboro FC. [135] Chicago and Oakland East Bay were both announced to launch by 2021, [136][137] but were indefinitely put on hold when they had issues in securing stadium plans. [138] The proposed East Bay club's bid had faltered due to stadium issues and its USL franchise rights were purchased by Oakland Roots SC, which had previously played in NISA, who started play in the USLC in the 2021 season. [139][140] On November 6, 2020, Reno 1868 FC announced it was ceasing operations as a result of the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19. [141] On January 10, 2021, North Carolina FC club chairman Stephen Malik announced that the club would make a "strategic move" to USL League One. [142] On February 1, 2021, Monterey Bay FC, which is a continuation of USLC's Fresno FC, joined the USL Championship since Beshoff, the owner of Fresno, was able to retain franchise rights after Fresno ceased operations due to lack of securing construction of a soccer-specific stadium, and landed the franchise in Monterey Bay at Cardinale Stadium on the campus of California State University, Monterey Bay in Seaside, California. On November 13, 2021, it was announced that Detroit City would join the USL Championship for the 2022 USL Championship season, becoming the third NISA team to join the league after Miami FC and Oakland Roots SC. [143] On December 2, 2021, Charlotte Independence decided to drop down to the third tier USL League One for 2022, with

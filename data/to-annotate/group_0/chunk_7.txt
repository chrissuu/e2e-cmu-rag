here. I only wish I could've had some time. I needed time to work things out and to
wait for new medication to kick in, but I couldn't do it in school, and I couldn't
bear the thought of having to leave for a full year, or of leaving and never being
readmitted. Love, Luchang. Students at Yale say that the university's policies force
them to hide their depression and avoid seeking help, for fear of being forced to
leave. [244][248][247] One prominent case was the suicide of Luchang Wang in 2015,
who died by suicide after making a Facebook post saying that she needed time to deal
with her mental health issues, but could not deal with being forced to medically withdraw
for an entire year with an uncertain chance of being readmitted. [250][247][252] Wang
had previously withdrawn from school due to mental health issues, and was afraid of
being forced to withdraw again, as a second readmission attempt would be considerably
more difficult for her. [250][247] A friend of Wang said that she routinely lied to
her university therapist to avoid being kicked out, [250] and another student said
that many at Yale lie to their counselors as "there's no clear standard established
that says exactly what students will get involuntarily hospitalized or withdrawn for".
[247] In response, the university convened a commission to evaluate their readmission
policies after a mental health withdrawal, renaming the process to "reinstatement",
eliminating the $50 reapplication fee, and giving students 5â€“6 more days to make their
decision on a mental health withdrawal. [244][253] For students that do seek help,
waitlists for therapy can be months long, with individual counselling sessions only
30 minutes in length. [244] In 2022, after a Washington Post article about their medical
withdrawal policies, the school increased the number of mental health clinicians on
campus from 51 to 60 as well as promised further changes. [245] In 2023, after a lawsuit
was filed against the school for what the plaintiffs described as discrimination,
the university changed the name of a "medical withdrawal" to a "medical leave of absence"
saying that the "leave of absence" terminology would allow students to remain on Yale's
insurance while away from the school. [254][255] The new policy also allowed for students
on a leave of absence to participate in extracurricular clubs and visit campus, [254][255]
something a student on medical withdrawal was banned from doing. [244] A representative
of Yale also said that the criticism of their policies "misrepresents our efforts
and unwavering commitment to supporting our students, whose well-being and success
are our primary focus" and that "the mental health of our students is a very, very
high priority". [245] After the death of undergraduate student Rachael Shaw Rosenbaum
by suicide, an organization called Elis for Rachael was formed, advocating for mental
health-related reforms. The group has sued Yale, demanding changes. [256] Yale has
had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of

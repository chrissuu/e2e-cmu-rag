Paintings, opened to negative reviews at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery. [212] That month,
despite apprehension from Warhol, his silkscreen series Reigning Queens was shown
at the Leo Castelli Gallery. [213] In the Andy Warhol Diaries, Warhol noted: "They
were supposed to be only for Europe—nobody here cares about royalty and it'll be another
bad review. "[214] In January 1987, Warhol traveled to Milan for the opening of his
last exhibition, Last Supper, at the Palazzo delle Stelline. [215] The next month,
Warhol modeled with jazz musician Miles Davis for Koshin Satoh's fashion show at the
Tunnel in New York City on February 17, 1987. [216][217] Warhol was initially diagnosed
with a gallstone in 1973, but he adamantly rejected surgery because he feared hospitals.
[218] When he was insistent about avoiding surgery, his internist Denton Cox attempted
to obtain an experimental medication from Japan. [219] The artist also sought guidance
from a chiropractor and nutritionist, who suggested that he wear a small crystal.
[219] Dehydrated and unable to eat, Warhol was in excruciating pain by February 1987.
[219] Warhol was admitted to New York Hospital in Manhattan on February 20, and he
underwent gallbladder surgery on February 21. [220] His surgeon Bjorn Thorbjarnarson
found his gallbladder "on the verge of perforating" and in danger of "spilling the
infection into (Warhol's) belly. "[219] Warhol was awake and able to walk about, make
phone calls, and watch television when both of his doctors visited him following the
four-hour operation. [219] His private nurse, Min Cho, saw his growing pallor at 4:
30 the following morning, but she did not call the hospital's cardiac-arrest team
until 5: 45 am, when he was "unresponsive" and turning blue. [221] He was pronounced
dead at 6: 31 a. m. from sudden cardiac arrhythmia. [222][221] Warhol's brothers took
his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-casket wake was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak
Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery.
Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, and a platinum wig. [223]
He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was
held at the Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church on Pittsburgh's North Side on February
26, 1987. Monsignor Peter Tay delivered the eulogy. [224] After the liturgy, the casket,
covered with white roses and asparagus ferns, was driven to St. John the Baptist Byzantine
Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, a south suburb of Pittsburgh, where Warhol was buried
near his parents. [225] The priest said a brief prayer at the graveside and sprinkled
holy water on the casket. Before the casket was lowered, Warhol's close friend and
Interview staffer Paige Powell placed copies of the February and March issues and
a bottle of Beautiful Eau de Parfum by Estée Lauder into his grave. [226][227] A memorial
service for Warhol was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan on April 1, 1987.

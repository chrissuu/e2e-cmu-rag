social mobility, research, and promoting public service. [110] In 2017, the Leiden Ranking, which focuses on science and the impact of scientific publications among the world's 500 major universities, ranked UW 12th globally and 5th in the U. S. [111][112] The university does not require submission of either SAT or ACT scores for admission, and the university position is that those scores are "not considered for admission, even if submitted (test blind)". [115][116] In 2024, newly enrolled students had a median high school GPA of 3. 82. [116] The university's undergraduate admissions process is rated 91/99 by the Princeton Review, [117][118] and is classified "more selective" by the U. S. News & World Report. [119] For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), UW received 48, 840 applications and accepted 26, 121 (53. 5%). Of those accepted, 7, 252 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 27. 8%. [120] UW's freshman retention rate is 93%, with 84% going on to graduate within six years. [120] Of the 19% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1240–1450. [120] Of the 8% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 29 and 34. [120] In the 2020–2021 academic year, 24 freshman students were National Merit Scholars. [121] The university uses capacity constrained majors, [122] a gate-keeping process that requires most students to apply to an internal college or faculty. New applications are usually considered once or twice annually, and few students are admitted each time. [123] The screening process is based on cumulative academic performance, recommendation letters and extracurricular activities. [124] UW's research budget surpassed the $1. 0 billion research budget milestone in 2012, [129] and university endowments reached almost $5. 0 billion by 2021. [130] In 2014, the University of Washington School of Oceanography and the UW Applied Physics Laboratory completed the construction of the first high-power underwater cabled observatory in the United States. Gabrielle Rocap, one of the researchers who discovered arsenic-breathing microbes in the Pacific, is part of the department's faculty. [131] To promote equal academic opportunity, especially for people of low income, UW launched Husky Promise in 2006. Families of income up to 65 percent of state median income or 235 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible. With this, up to 30 percent of undergraduate students may be eligible. The cut-off income level that UW set is the highest in the nation, making top-quality education available to more people. UW President Mark Emmert said that being "elitist is not in our DNA". [132][133] UW was the host university of ResearchChannel program (now defunct), the only TV channel in the United States dedicated solely for the dissemination of research from academic institutions and research organizations. [134] Participation of ResearchChannel included 36 universities, 15 research organizations, two corporate research centers and many other affiliates. [135] Alan Michelson, now Head of the Built Environments Library at UW Seattle, manages the Pacific Coast Architecture Database (PCAD), which Michelson started in 2002 while he worked as Architecture and Design Librarian at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The PCAD serves as a searchable public database detailing significant but importantly, also lesser-known and -lauded designers, buildings and structures, and partnerships, with links including to bibliographic literature. [136] In 2019, iDefense reported that Chinese hackers had launched cyberattacks on dozens of academic institutions in an attempt to gain information on technology being developed for the United States Navy. [137] Some of the targets included the University of Washington. [137] The attacks have been underway since at least April 2017. [137] The University of Washington had 50, 097 total enrollments as of fall 2023, making it the largest university on the West Coast by student population in spite of its selective admissions process. [139] It also boasts one of the most diverse student bodies within the US, with more than 50% of its undergraduate students self-identifying with minority groups. [140][141][113][142] The University of Washington boasts over 800 active Registered Student Organizations (RSOs), one of the largest networks of any universities in the world. RSOs are dedicated to a wide variety of interests both in and beyond campus. Some of these interest areas include academic focus groups, cultural exchanges, environmental activities, Greek life, political/social action, religious discussions, sports, international student gatherings by country, and STEM-specific events. The Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) is one of two student governments at the University of Washington, the other being the Graduate and Professional Student Senate. It is funded and supported by student fees, and provides services that directly and indirectly benefit them. The ASUW employs over 72 current University of Washington students, has over 500 volunteers, and spends $1. 03 million annually to provide services and activities to the student body of 43, 000 on-campus. [143] The Student Senate was established in 1994 as a division of the Associated Students of the University of Washington. Student Senate is one of two official student-governed bodies and provides a broad-based discussion of issues. Currently, the ASUW Student Senate has a legislative body of over 150 senators representing a diverse set of interests on and off-campus. [144] The ASUW was incorporated in the State of Washington in 1906. [145] The ASUW Experimental College, part of the ASUW, was created in 1968 by several University of Washington students seeking to provide the campus and surrounding community with a selection of non-credit classes not offered on the university curriculum. The Experimental College ceased operation in 2017. [146] The student newspaper is The Daily of the University of Washington. It is the second-largest[clarification needed] daily paper in Seattle. In 2010, The Daily launched a half-hour weekly television magazine show, The Daily's Double Shot, on UWTV Channel 27. UW continues to use its proprietary UWTV channel, online and printed publications. [147] The faculty also produce their own publications for students and alumni. The Tyee was the official student yearbook of the University of Washington. [148][149] Throughout the 20th century, UW student activism centered around a variety of national and international concerns, from nuclear energy to the Vietnam War and civil rights. In 1948, at the beginning of the McCarthyism era, students brought their activism to bear on campus by protesting the firing of three UW professors accused of communist affiliations. [150][151] In May 2025, pro-Palestinian protestors caused approximately $1 million in damage to the school's Interdisciplinary Engineering Building. 31 people were arrested. [152] The university operates one of the largest campuses of any higher education institution in the world. Despite this, growing faculty and student count has strained the regional housing supply as well as transportation facilities. Starting in 2012, UW began taking active measures to explore, plan and enact a series of campus policies to manage the annual growth. In addition to new buildings, parking and light rail stations, new building construction and renovations have been scheduled to take place through 2020. [153] The plan includes the construction of three six-story residence halls and two apartment complexes in the west section of campus, near the existing Terry and Lander Halls, in Phase I,

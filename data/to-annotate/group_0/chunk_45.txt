life's challenges by helping them to grow intellectually, spiritually, emotionally,
and socially. The curriculum has been modified over time. The college originally awarded
only the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees to young women of traditional
college age. In 1972, a continuing education department, now called the School of
Continuing Studies, was established to extend opportunities for undergraduate study
to mature women and men. Many classes are conducted on evenings and weekends to accommodate
the schedules of older students. The coeducational school of graduate studies was
established in 1980 to offer master's degrees; in 1997, it added a doctoral program.
Academic changes also included expanding beyond the physical limits of the campus.
As a member of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Consortium for Higher Education (SEPCHE),
Chestnut Hill pursues a collaborative approach to higher education with seven other
local institutions. Through membership in the Association of Colleges of Sisters of
St. Joseph (ACSSJ), Chestnut Hill offers its students opportunities to enrich their
educational experiences by studying at seven other colleges in the United States.
Study-abroad programs also are available. In November 2001, Chestnut Hill College
announced plans to admit men to the traditional-age, full-time undergraduate program
in fall 2003. With the enrollment of male students, the 78-year-old College for Women
became the School of Undergraduate Studies. Enrollment increased dramatically after
the undergraduate college became coeducational, increasing 80% by fall 2005, and total
enrollment numbered well over 2, 000 in the 2010s. The Chestnut Hill campus is listed
on the National Register of Historic Places. For many years the main buildings were
St. Joseph Hall, with a six-story Greco-Roman rotunda and French Gothic exterior,
Fournier Hall, a jewel of Italian Romanesque architecture, and Clement Hall, which
houses classrooms and modest athletic facilities, including a swimming pool. The campus
grounds include a grotto and fountain, the House of Loretto, and an elegant main chapel
that was inspired by Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. Logue Library, Fontbonne Hall, Barbara
D'Iorio Martino Hall and, most recently, a new residence hall called Fitzsimmons Hall
are relatively new additions to accommodate the college's growth. New structures were
designed to preserve the architectural integrity of the campus while addressing specific
educational or student life needs. In recent years, the science facilities and computer
laboratories have been renovated to help create a 21st-century teaching and learning
environment. Martino Hall includes "smart" classrooms and seminar rooms that are part
of the campus-wide interactive network. In 2006, Chestnut Hill announced the acquisition
(from the Albert M. Greenfield Foundation for $11 million) of the Sugarloaf Estate,
a 30-acre (120, 000 m2) non-contiguous property across Germantown Avenue and Wissahickon
Creek from the existing campus. It was previously used as The Albert M. Greenfield
Conference Center of Temple University as well as the headquarters of the Greenfield
Foundation, and from 1952 to 1967, as the residence of the Foundation's namesake,
local realty magnate Albert M. Greenfield. The additional property was used to accommodate

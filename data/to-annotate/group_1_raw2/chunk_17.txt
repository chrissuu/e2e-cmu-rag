in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP
in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs
and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the
Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition
. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA , were so popular
with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Joseph
Guffey , statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant David Lawrence
gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide
victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence
used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic
machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that
a high rate of people on relief was not only "a challenge" but also "an opportunity".
He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage. [ 70 ] Pittsburgh was at the
center of the " Arsenal of Democracy " that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and
machinery for the U. S. during World War II . Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million
tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce
shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great
Migration from the South to the city in order to find work. [ 11 ] David Lawrence
, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's
governor from 1959 to 1963. [ 71 ] Lawrence used his political power to transform
Pittsburgh's political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the
city well and honestly. [ 72 ] In 1946 Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control
Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future
economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's
working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless
fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called
for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened
the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the
smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence
in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll. [ 73 ] Year City Population

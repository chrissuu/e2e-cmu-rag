i. e. you will get one month free. My credit card's expiration date is before my Opus
Pass expires. What should I do? Please call us at 412-281-0912 ext. 3 with your updated
credit card information prior to your card expiring. Is it possible to cancel my Opus
Pass before it expires? If you need to cancel your Opus Pass before it expires, you
can choose to receive a refund for the difference in value between what you've paid
so far for your Pass and the normal single ticket face value price of any tickets
you redeemed. For example, if you had been a Passholder for six months and paid $120
for your Pass so far, and you'd redeemed your Pass for one ticket which had a regular
price of $110, you would be eligible for a $10 refund. If you have redeemed your Pass
for tickets whose normal face values totals more than you've paid so far for your
Pass, then Pittsburgh Opera reserves the right to charge you for the difference. For
example, if you buy a Pass, immediately redeem it for a ticket, and then after the
performance you cancel your Pass, we will charge you the difference between the regular
ticket price and the $20 you paid for your Pass. The Opus Pass is a great value, we
just want to make sure folks don't try to game the system - not that you would ever
do that of course! All future ticket reservations will be forfeited upon cancellation

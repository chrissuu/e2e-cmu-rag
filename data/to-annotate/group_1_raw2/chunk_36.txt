years by members of the Hopewell culture . [ 3 ] By 1700 the Haudenosaunee , the Five
Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over
the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds. Other tribes included the
Lenape , who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement,
and the Shawnee , who had migrated up from the south. [ 4 ] With the arrival of European
explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from
Europe, such as smallpox , measles , influenza , and malaria , to which they had no
immunity. [ 5 ] In 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown , 18 miles (29 km) downriver
from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca
, 74 Mohawk , 35 Onondaga , 20 Cayuga , and 15 Oneida . Other tribes were 165 Lenape
, 162 Shawnee , 100 Wyandot , 40 Tisagechroami , and 15 Mohican . [ 6 ] Shannopin's
Town , a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established
in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly
from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street
to 39th Street. According to George Croghan , the town was situated on the south bank
of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island , in what is
now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh. [ 7 ] : 289 Sawcunk
, on the mouth of the Beaver River , was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence
of Shingas , a chief of theirs. [ 8 ] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established
in 1734 by Peter Chartier . Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny,
with an estimated 300–400 residents. [ 9 ] Early colonization (1747–1763) The first
Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe
the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders
established posts and settlements in the area. [ 10 ] Europeans first began to settle
in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company , a Virginian land speculation
company, won a grant of 200, 000 acres (800 km 2 ) in the upper Ohio Valley. From
a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland , the company began to construct an 80-mile
(130 km) wagon road to the Monongahela River [ 11 ] employing a Lenape Indian chief
named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Michael Cresap to begin widening
the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American
trail [ 12 ] now known as Nemacolin's Trail . The river crossing and flats at Redstone
creek , was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road.

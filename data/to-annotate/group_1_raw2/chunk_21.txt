the 1955 National Invitation Tournament on its second straight trip to the NIT title

Cooper was the first African American drafted by an NBA team. [ 60 ] The Panthers

The program has produced 27 NBA draft picks and 15 All Americans while ranking No.
1 in the nation as recently as 2009. The Petersen Events Center is home to the " Oakland
Zoo ", a student section which is nationally recognized [ 61 ] for its passionate

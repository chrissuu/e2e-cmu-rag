Oppenheimer Anora The Academy Awards, commonly known as the Oscars, are awards for
artistic and technical merit in film. [1][2] They are presented annually by the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) in the United States in recognition of
excellence in cinematic achievements, as assessed by the Academy's voting membership.
[3] The Oscars are widely considered to be the most prestigious awards in the film
industry. [4] The major award categories, known as the Academy Awards of Merit, [5]
are presented during a live-televised Hollywood ceremony in February or March. It
is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony. [1] The 1st Academy Awards
were held in 1929. [6] The second ceremony, in 1930, was the first to be broadcast
by radio. The 1953 ceremony was the first to be televised. [1] It is the oldest of
the four major annual American entertainment awards. Its counterparts—the Emmy Awards
for television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy Awards for music—are modeled
after the Academy Awards. [7] The Oscar statuette depicts a knight, rendered in the
Art Deco style. [8] The first Academy Awards presentation was held on May 16, 1929,
at a private dinner function at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, with an audience of
about 270 people. [9] The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel. [1] The
cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 (equivalent to $92 in 2024).
Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors, and other participants
in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period.
The ceremony ran for 15 minutes. For this first ceremony, winners were announced to
the media three months earlier. [10] For the second ceremony in 1930, and the rest
of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11: 00
pm on the night of the awards. [1] In 1940, the Los Angeles Times announced the winners
before the ceremony began. As a result, in 1941 the Academy started using a sealed
envelope to reveal the names of the winners. [1] The term "Oscar" is a registered
trademark of the AMPAS. The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances
in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. As he had to return to Europe before
the ceremony, the Academy agreed to give him the prize early, making him the first

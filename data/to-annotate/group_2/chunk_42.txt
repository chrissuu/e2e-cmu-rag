then-chancellor Kevin Scarce, and also lied to the Commissioner in his evidence with
respect to an investigation of sexual misconduct with a postgraduate student when
he was employed at the University of Melbourne. [513] The ICAC Commissioner Bruce
Lander acknowledged there were "further issues" in the full 170-page report on the
investigation which he chose not to release due to privacy concerns surrounding the
victims, instead releasing an abridged 12-page version 'Statement about an Investigation:
Misconduct by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide'. [514] In determining
his findings, the Commissioner relied in part on the personal blog[515] of US journalist
Michael Balter, who documented Rathjens prior history of sexual harassment, and was
largely responsible for bringing the matter to the public's attention, and ultimately
ICAC's. [516] Claiming ill-health, Rathjen formally resigned in July 2020 and, despite
the ICAC Commissioner's findings, received a large payout from the university. [517]
The university is served by two stops on the Glenelg tram line, University and City
West, which connects the main campus on the east with the Adelaide Health and Medical
Sciences Building on the west end of North Terrace. [518][128][167] 34°55′09″S 138°36′15″E﻿

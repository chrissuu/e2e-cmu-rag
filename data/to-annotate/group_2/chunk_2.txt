and Tail football", which then became "flag football" after the war ended. [3] The
first known recorded history of flag football can be traced to Fort Meade, Maryland,
USA, which is now generally accepted as the sport's birthplace. The first national
flag football organization, the National Touch Football League (NTFL), was formed
in the 1960s in St. Louis, Missouri. Since 1971, the league has had a national championship
game. [4] Arizona teachers Porter Wilson and Norman Adams invented flag-a-tag belts
and flags[5][6][7] which are the template for the flags used in the game today. The
specific rules of flag football vary widely by league, though all share in common
their replication of the rules of traditional American football with tackling replaced
by flag-pulling. Traditional American football rules are often eliminated or modified
to reflect the more recreational nature of the game, the desire to avoid physical
contact and injury, and the generally smaller number of participating players per
side. In a standard game of flag football, the match is played in two halves. Time
length is determined by the league being played. [8] The clock only stops for injuries,
half-time and timeouts. Most leagues have 10 players per team, 5 on offense and 5
on defence, there is no punting team for flag football. Chiefly, because there is
no dominant sanctioning organization for the sport, the game has mutated into many
variations: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 players on each side; coed or single-gender; with
kicking and punting and with point-after conversions (including some with 1, 2, and
3 point tries) or without; and field sizes that vary from full Canadian Football League
(CFL) size, National Football League (NFL) size (120 yards long by 531⁄3 yards wide),
to fields a third that size. An important distinction is whether linemen are allowed
to catch passes ("Eligible Linemen") or, as in the NFL / CFL, are not allowed to do
so ("Ineligible Linemen"). Flag (and touch) football may also be divided into "contact"
or "non-contact", depending on whether or not blocking is allowed; if allowed, blocking
is usually restricted to the chest. [9] The ability or inability of the quarterback
to advance the ball past the line of scrimmage (LOS) by running is another rule subject
to variation by the league. The sport is also played on surfaces other than a traditional
grass football field, including on sand beaches; beach flag football has previously
featured as a discipline at the Asian Beach Games. [10] The International Federation
of American Footbal (IFAF) organise a biannual IFAF Flag Football World Championship.
In July 2022, the National Football League (NFL) and the IFAF partnered on a bid for
flag football to be included as an optional event during the 2028 Summer Olympics
in Los Angeles. The NFL had sponsored the inclusion of flag football as an invitational
event during that month's 2022 World Games—a multi-sport event featuring sports and
disciplines not currently contested at the Olympics—in Birmingham, Alabama. The men's

endorse the notion than men should be the sole breadwinners of the family, while Mexican
American women did not endorse this notion. [217] Prior to the 1960s countercultural
movement, Mexican men often felt an exaggerated need to be the sole breadwinner of
their families. [218] There are two sides to machismo, the man who has a strong work
ethic and lives up to his responsibilities, or the man who heavily drinks and therefore
displays acts of unpleasant behavior towards his family. [217] The traditional roles
of women in a Hispanic community are of housewife and mother, a woman's role is to
cook, clean, and care for her children and husband; putting herself and her needs
last. [219] The typical structure of a Hispanic family forces women to defer authority
to her husband, allowing him to make the important decisions, that both the woman
and children must abide by. [220] In traditional Hispanic households, women and young
girls are homebodies or muchachas de la casa ("girls of the house"), showing that
they abide "by the cultural norms . .. [of] respectability, chastity, and family honor
[as] valued by the [Hispanic] community". [221] Migration to the United States can
change the identity of Hispanic youth in various ways, including how they carry their
gendered identities. [222] However, when Hispanic women come to the United States,
they tend to adapt to the perceived social norms of this new country and their social
location changes as they become more independent and able to live without the financial
support of their families or partners. [222] The unassimilated community views these
adapting women as being de la calle ("of [or from] the street"), transgressive, and
sexually promiscuous. [222] A women's motive for pursuing an education or career is
to prove she can care and make someone of herself, breaking the traditional gender
role that a Hispanic woman can only serve as a mother or housewife, thus changing
a woman's role in society. [223] Some Hispanic families in the United States "deal
with young women's failure to adhere to these culturally prescribed norms of proper
gendered behavior in a variety of ways, including sending them to live in . .. [the
sending country] with family members, regardless of whether or not . .. [the young
women] are sexually active". [224] Now there has been a rise in the Hispanic community
where both men and women are known to work and split the household chores among themselves;
women are encouraged to gain an education, degree, and pursue a career. [225] According
to polling data released in 2022, 11% of Hispanic American adults identify as gay,
lesbian, bisexual or transgender. This is more than twice the rate of White Americans
or African Americans. Over 20% of Hispanic Millennials and Gen Z claimed an LGBT identity.
[226] The growth of the young Hispanic population is driving an increase of the LGBT
community in the United States. [227] Studies have shown that Hispanic Americans are

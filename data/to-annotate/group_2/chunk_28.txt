laws to kill vulnerable people. The Center for Disability Rights points to the troubling
reality that many disabled people are at the mercy of unscrupulous caregivers, medical
providers, and insurance companies. Legal MAID endangers a community “at grave risk
of coercion and abuse while creating an opportunity for insurance companies to enhance
their bottom line. ” [33] Legalizing MAID “invites coercion, ” according to attorney
Margaret Dore, because abusive or impatient heirs and caregivers can shepherd the
elderly toward suicide by helping them complete the necessary steps, picking up their
medication, and potentially even administering the lethal drug because no witnesses
are required at the time of death. [34] [42] “BIPOC [Black Indigenous and People of
Color] Disabled people are at greater risk from assisted suicide laws because of racial
disparities in health care, ” says Ayishetu Salifu Mamudu, Deaf Systems Advocate at
the Regional Center for Independent Living. “Although privileged white people present
this as a rights issue, the reality is that BIPOC are in the cross hairs of this bad
policy. I urge policy makers to recognize that and understand that in establishing
this rights [sic] for some people, BIPOC individuals – and others – will die before
their time. That is unacceptable. ” [33] Instead of facilitating suicide, palliative
care is an effective, compassionate solution that does not imperil vulnerable groups.
Zach Garafalo, Manager of Government Affairs at the Center for Disability Rights,
points out that “anyone dying in discomfort that is not otherwise relievable, already
may legally receive palliative sedation, wherein the patient is sedated to the point
that the discomfort is relieved while the dying process takes place. We already have
a legal solution to any uncomfortable deaths that does not endanger others the way
an assisted suicide law does. ” Legal hospice organizations already provide this end-of-life
care and comfort. [33] Con 3: MAID is a slippery slope to legal euthanasia, or worse.
Describing legal MAID as a “moral cliff” rather than a slippery slope, John Stonestreet
and Shane Morris, both of the Colson Center for Christian Worldview, highlight the
fact that the “patient may request to die, but the doctor is still the one who determines
whether the patient is competent and eligible. Small wonder that wherever medical
aid in dying has been legalized, doctors and lawmakers have quickly begun asking why
they need [a] patient’s permission before exercising ‘compassion’…. Once death is
a treatment option, patients can no longer trust their doctors, their insurance companies,
or even their families to have their best interests at heart. ‘Terminal illness’ quickly
broadens to include ‘intolerable suffering’ which soon broadens to include ‘mental
suffering. ’” [35] While the laws may be written with good intent, time chips away
at the restrictions that might protect people. For example, in 2022, Oregon eliminated
the requirement that patients requesting MAID be state residents. [36] In 2021, Canada,
which legalized MAID and euthanasia simultaneously, removed the criterion that the

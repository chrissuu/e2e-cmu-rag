made up 0. 7–1. 0 percent of Qatar’s 2022 GDP, with World Cup-related tourism and
broadcasting revenue estimated at US$2. 3–4. 1 billion. [138] High and rising incomes
in Qatar offer significant opportunities in culinary establishments and retail sectors.
Premium and healthy brands are especially well received. Convenience food is also
an increasingly important sector for younger Qataris and visitors. [139] In recent
years, Qatar has been taking steps to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance
on oil and gas revenues. The country has launched several initiatives aimed at promoting
non-oil sectors such as tourism, finance, and technology. For example, Qatar has invested
heavily in building world-class infrastructure, including the Hamad International
Airport and the Qatar Free Zones Authority, to attract foreign investors and businesses
to set up shop in the country. Moreover, Qatar has also been working towards creating
a more business-friendly environment by streamlining regulations and offering incentives
to start-ups and small businesses. The country's ambition in this area can already
be seen in developments like the recently completed M7 building in downtown Doha.
This futuristic five-story construction is described as an epicentre for innovation
and entrepreneurship in design, fashion, and technology. [140] The latest research
by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) which highlighted the top 10 cities
where international travelers spent the most in 2022, showed Doha, Qatar at the number
2 spot with $16. 8 bn. [141] Qatar has received over 2. 56 million visitors from January
until 25 August 2023, exceeding the full year arrival figures from 2022, representing
a 157 per cent increase over the same period last year, according to a report by Zawya
citing figures released yesterday by Qatar Tourism (QT). [142][143] Doha named Arab
tourism capital for 2023. Non-GCC tourists made up 66% of all visitors in October,
an increase of 10% from the previous month 2023. [144] Doha in 2023 hosted International
Horticultural Expo 2023, Spanning 1. 7 million square meters, the event takes place
in Al Bidda Park, one of the biggest parks in Doha which overlooks the Persian Gulf.
[145][146][147] In Doha's traditional architecture, the primary building material
was locally quarried limestone, with walls typically measuring 0. 4 metres (1 ft 4
in) to 0. 6 metres (2 ft 0 in) thick, constructed using two rows of large facing stones
with a core of mud, gravel, and smaller stones. These walls were then covered with
clay-rich mud or gypsum-based render. Plaster, known as juss, was made from crushed
beachrock, shell, baked lime, or gypsum, and applied in three layers for both functional
and decorative purposes. Roofing was characteristically flat, utilizing mangrove beams
(danshal) imported from East Africa, overlaid with split bamboo, woven reed, and palm
mats, then sealed with tamped earth. [148] Distinctive architectural elements included
colonnaded verandas (liwan) with lintels made of mangrove poles bound with jute rope,
and wooden waterspouts for drainage. Valuable materials such as wooden beams, windows,

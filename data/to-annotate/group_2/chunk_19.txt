if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U. S. [70][71][72] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a. [73] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%. [74] The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73. 2 °F (22. 9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9. 5 days a year, [75] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28. 8 °F (−1. 8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2. 6 nights per year. [75] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901. [75][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995. [75] Average annual precipitation is 39. 61 inches (1, 006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22. 65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57. 83 in (1, 469 mm) in 2018. [76] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44. 1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8. 8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51. [77] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy. [78] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%). United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate. [82][83] Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average. [84] It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards. [84] Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism. [85] As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31, 000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850, 000 annually in tree planting and maintenance. [86] Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure. [87] Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959. [88] Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers. [89][90] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers per year, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations. [91] The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019. [92][93][94] The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016. [95][96][97] While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike. [98][99][100] In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water. [101] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead. [101] There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children. [102] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children. [102][103] At the 2010 census, there were 305, 704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8. 6% since 2000; 66. 0% of the population was White, 25. 8% Black or African American, 0. 2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4. 4% Asian, 0. 3% Other, and 2. 3% mixed; in 2020, 2. 3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race. Non-Hispanic whites were 64. 8% of the population in 2010, [107] compared to 78. 7% in 1970. [108] By the 2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302, 971. [106] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64. 7% non-Hispanic white, 23. 0% Black or African American, 5. 8% Asian, and 3. 2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19. 7%), Irish (15. 8%), Italian (11. 8%), Polish (8. 4%), and English (4. 6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15. 4% Italian American and 11. 6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation, [114] and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census. [115] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States. [116] Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country. Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. [117] In 2010, there were 143, 739 households, out of which 21. 9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31. 2% were married couples living together, 16. 5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48. 4% were non-families. 39. 4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13. 7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2. 17 and the average family size was 2. 95. In the city, the population

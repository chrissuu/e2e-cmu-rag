David M. Kelley (born February 10, 1951) is an American engineer, designer, businessman,
and educator. He is co-founder of the design firm IDEO and a professor at Stanford
University. He has received several honors for his contributions to design and design
education. [2] Kelley was born in Barberton, Ohio. [3][4] His brother is Tom Kelley,
who later became general manager of IDEO and author of The Art of Innovation and The
Ten Faces of Innovation. [5] David M. Kelley received a Bachelor of Science with a
major in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 1973. [3] He received
a Master of Science in design from Stanford University in 1977. He was a member of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at CMU. He is married to Katharine C. Branscomb,
a former CEO of IntelliCorp, whom he met through mutual friend Steve Jobs. [3] Kelley
began work as an engineer, first at Boeing and later at NCR. [2] At Boeing, he was
responsible for the design of the Lavatory Occupied sign for the 747 airplane. [6]
This experience led him to return to school. In 1977, he earned his master's degree
from the Joint Program in Design at Stanford University, popularly called the Product
Design program. [7] In 1978, he partnered with another Stanford Product Design graduate,
Dean Hovey, to form Hovey-Kelley Design. Hovey left to pursue other interests and
the firm was renamed "David Kelley Design" (DKD). [8] In 1984, he co-founded Onset
Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm. He also co-founded Edge Innovations,
the special-effects company responsible for the whales in the Free Willy movies, among
many other film credits. [9] In 1991, Kelley merged DKD with three other design firms
(Mike Nuttall's Matrix Product Design in Palo Alto, ID TWO in San Francisco, and Moggridge
Associates in London, the latter two founded by Bill Moggridge) to create IDEO, which
he ran as CEO until 2000. Kelley began teaching in the Stanford Product Design program
in 1978, after earning his master's. He was briefly a PhD student. [10] In 1990, he
became a tenured professor, and was named the Donald W. Whittier Professor in Mechanical
Engineering in 2002. [7] In 2004, Kelley led the creation of the Hasso Plattner Institute
of Design at Stanford University, known as the "d. school. "[11] For his contributions
to the practice and study of design, Kelley has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees

but he, overhearing, thinks she means the Count. Susanna hides in time to see Cherubino
woo the Countess—now disguised in Susanna's dress—until Almaviva chases him away and
sends his wife, who he thinks is Susanna, to an arbor, to which he follows. By now
Figaro understands the joke and, joining the fun, makes exaggerated love to Susanna
in her Countess disguise. The Count returns, seeing, or so he thinks, Figaro with
his wife. Outraged, he calls everyone to witness his judgment, but now the real Countess
appears and reveals the ruse. Grasping the truth at last, the Count begs her pardon.
All are reunited, and so ends this "mad day" at the Almaviva court. ~Adapted from

assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent in three years to 15, 771 occurrences in 2014. [156] In 2014, Philadelphia enacted an ordinance decriminalizing the possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana or eight grams of hashish; the ordinance gave police officers the discretion to treat possession of these amounts as a civil infraction punishable by a $25 ticket, rather than a crime. [297][298] At the time, Philadelphia was at the largest city in the nation to decriminalize the possession of marijuana. [298] From 2013 to 2018, marijuana arrests in the city dropped by more than 85%. [297] The purchase or sale of marijuana remains a criminal offense in Philadelphia. [298] The Philadelphia Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services (EMS). The department's official mission is to protect public safety by quick and professional response to emergencies and the promotion of sound emergency prevention measures. This mandate encompasses all traditional firefighting functions, including fire suppression, with 60 engine companies and 30 ladder companies[299] as well as specialty and support units deployed throughout the city; specialized firefighting units for Philadelphia International Airport and the Port of Philadelphia; investigations conducted by the fire marshal's office to determine the origins of fires and develop preventive strategies; prevention programs to educate the public; and support services including research and planning, management of the fire communications center within the city's 911 system, and operation of the Philadelphia Fire Academy.

[300] The Philadelphia School District is the eighth-largest school district in the nation[301] with 142, 266 students in 218 traditional public schools and 86 charter schools as of 2014[update]. [302] The city's K-12 enrollment in district–run schools dropped from 156, 211 students in 2010 to 130, 104 students in 2015. During the same time period, the enrollment in charter schools increased from 33, 995 students in 2010 to 62, 358 students in 2015. [156] This consistent drop in enrollment led the city to close 24 of its public schools in 2013. [303] During the 2014 school year, the city spent an average of $12, 570 per pupil, below the average among comparable urban school districts. [156] Graduation rates among district-run schools, meanwhile, steadily increased in the ten years from 2005. In 2005, Philadelphia had a district graduation rate of 52%. This number increased to 65% in 2014, still below the national and state averages. Scores on the state's standardized test, the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) trended upward from 2005 to 2011 but subsequently decreased. In 2005, the district-run schools scored an average of 37. 4% on math and 35. 5% on reading. The city's schools reached their peak scores in 2011 with 59. 0% on math and 52. 3% on reading. In 2014, the scores dropped significantly to 45. 2% on math and 42. 0% on reading. [156] Of the city's public high schools, including charter schools, only four performed above the national average on the SAT (1497 out of 2400[304]) in 2014: Masterman, Central, Girard Academic Music Program, and MaST Community Charter School. All other district-run schools were below average. [156] Medical and research facilities of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

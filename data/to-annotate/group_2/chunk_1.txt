of DRAM in use. From its origins in the late 1960s, it was commonplace in computing
up until around 1997, when it was mostly replaced by synchronous DRAM. In the present
day, manufacture of asynchronous RAM is relatively rare. [57] An asynchronous DRAM
chip has power connections, some number of address inputs (typically 12), and a few
(typically one or four) bidirectional data lines. There are three main active-low
control signals: This interface provides direct control of internal timing: when RAS
is driven low, a CAS cycle must not be attempted until the sense amplifiers have sensed
the memory state, and RAS must not be returned high until the storage cells have been
refreshed. When RAS is driven high, it must be held high long enough for precharging
to complete. Although the DRAM is asynchronous, the signals are typically generated
by a clocked memory controller, which limits their timing to multiples of the controller's
clock cycle. For completeness, we mention two other control signals which are not
essential to DRAM operation, but are provided for the convenience of systems using
DRAM: Classic asynchronous DRAM is refreshed by opening each row in turn. The refresh
cycles are distributed across the entire refresh interval in such a way that all rows
are refreshed within the required interval. To refresh one row of the memory array
using RAS only refresh (ROR), the following steps must occur: This can be done by
supplying a row address and pulsing RAS low; it is not necessary to perform any CAS
cycles. An external counter is needed to iterate over the row addresses in turn. [58]
In some designs, the CPU handled RAM refresh. The Zilog Z80 is perhaps the best known
example, as it has an internal row counter R which supplies the address for a special
refresh cycle generated after each instruction fetch. [59] In other systems, especially
home computers, refresh was handled by the video circuitry as a side effect of its
periodic scan of the frame buffer. [60] For convenience, the counter was quickly incorporated
into the DRAM chips themselves. If the CAS line is driven low before RAS (normally
an illegal operation), then the DRAM ignores the address inputs and uses an internal
counter to select the row to open. [58][61] This is known as CAS-before-RAS (CBR)
refresh. This became the standard form of refresh for asynchronous DRAM, and is the
only form generally used with SDRAM. Given support of CAS-before-RAS refresh, it is
possible to deassert RAS while holding CAS low to maintain data output. If RAS is
then asserted again, this performs a CBR refresh cycle while the DRAM outputs remain
valid. Because data output is not interrupted, this is known as hidden refresh. [61]
Hidden refresh is no faster than a normal read followed by a normal refresh, but does
maintain the data output valid during the refresh cycle. Page mode DRAM is a minor
modification to the first-generation DRAM IC interface which improves the performance

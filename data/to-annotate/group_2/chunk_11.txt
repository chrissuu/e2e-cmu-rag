The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State or PSU) is a public state-related land-grant
research university with campuses and facilities throughout Pennsylvania, United States.
Founded in 1855 as Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania, [13] Penn State was named
the state's first land-grant university eight years later, in 1863. Its primary campus,
known as Penn State University Park, is located in State College and College Township.
Penn State enrolls more than 89, 000 students, of which more than 74, 000 are undergraduates
and more than 14, 000 are postgraduates. In addition to its land-grant designation,
the university is a sea-grant, space-grant, and sun-grant university. It is classified
among "R1: Doctoral Universities â€“ Very high research activity" and is a member of
the Association of American Universities (AAU). [14][15] The university has two law
schools: Penn State Law on the school's University Park campus and Penn State Dickinson
Law in Carlisle. The College of Medicine is in Hershey. The university maintains 19
commonwealth campuses and five special mission campuses located across Pennsylvania.
[16] The university competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the NCAA for
most of its athletic teams, known collectively as the Penn State Nittany Lions. Since
its founding, Penn State has won 82 national collegiate team championships, including
54 NCAA titles across all sports, and Penn State students, alumni, faculty, and coaches
have won a total of 74 Olympic medals, including 20 gold medals. Pennsylvania State
University was founded in 1855 when James Irvin, a U. S. Congressman from Bellefonte,
donated 200 acres (0. 8 km2) of land in Centre County[17] to the newly-established
Farmers High School of Pennsylvania, representing the first of 10, 101 acres (41 km2)
the school eventually acquired. The same year, on February 22, the Pennsylvania General
Assembly designated the school a degree-granting institution. [18][17] Initially sponsored
by the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society, the use of "college" or "university"
was avoided in the school's naming since local Pennsylvanians perceived that such
institutions were impractical in their curricula. In 1862, the school's name was changed
to the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania. The following year, in 1863, the Morrill
Land-Grant Acts was passed by the U. S. Congress, and Pennsylvania selected the school
to be the state's sole land-grant college. [17] Two years later, in 1874, the school's
name was changed to the Pennsylvania State College. [17] By 1875, enrollment fell

interaction: an analogy that is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field.
[5][6] Humans interact with computers in many ways, and the interface between the
two is crucial to facilitating this interaction. HCI is also sometimes termed human–machine
interaction (HMI), man-machine interaction (MMI) or computer-human interaction (CHI).
Desktop applications, web browsers, handheld computers, and computer kiosks make use
of the prevalent graphical user interfaces (GUI) of today. [7] Voice user interfaces
(VUIs) are used for speech recognition and synthesizing systems, and the emerging
multi-modal and Graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow humans to engage with embodied
character agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms.
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) defines human–computer interaction as
"a discipline that is concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of
interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena
surrounding them". [7] A key aspect of HCI is user satisfaction, also referred to
as End-User Computing Satisfaction. It goes on to say: "Because human–computer interaction
studies a human and a machine in communication, it draws from supporting knowledge
on both the machine and the human side. On the machine side, techniques in computer
graphics, operating systems, programming languages, and development environments are
relevant. On the human side, communication theory, graphic and industrial design disciplines,
linguistics, social sciences, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and human factors
such as computer user satisfaction are relevant. And, of course, engineering and design
methods are relevant. "[7] HCI ensures that humans can safely and efficiently interact
with complex technologies in fields like aviation and healthcare. [8] Due to the multidisciplinary
nature of HCI, people with different backgrounds contribute to its success. Poorly
designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic
example is the Three Mile Island accident, a nuclear meltdown accident, where investigations
concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least partly responsible
for the disaster. [9][10][11] Similarly, some accidents in aviation have resulted
from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard flight instruments or throttle quadrant
layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine
interaction, pilots had already ingrained the "standard" layout. Thus, the conceptually
good idea had unintended results. [12] A human–computer interface can be described
as the interface of communication between a human user and a computer. [13] The flow
of information between the human and computer is defined as the loop of interaction.
[14] The loop of interaction has several aspects to it, including: Human–computer
interaction involves the ways in which humans make—or do not make—use of computational
artifacts, systems, and infrastructures. Much of the research in this field seeks
to improve the human–computer interaction by improving the usability of computer interfaces.
[15] How usability is to be precisely understood, how it relates to other social and
cultural values, and when it is, and when it may not be a desirable property of computer
interfaces is increasingly debated. [16][17] Much of the research in the field of

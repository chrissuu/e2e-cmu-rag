admitted female students that first year, [68][69] with two more converted the next
school year. [70][71] In 1971, Mary Ann Proctor, a transfer from St. Mary's, became
the first female undergraduate. The following year, Mary Davey Bliley became the first
woman to graduate from the university with a bachelor's degree in marketing. [72][73]
In 1978, a historic district comprising 21 contributing buildings was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places. [74] In the eighteen years Edward Malloy was
president, the school's reputation, faculty, and resources grew rapidly. [75][76][77]
He added more than 500 professors and the academic quality of the student body improved
dramatically, with the average Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) score rising from
1240 to 1460. The number of minority students more than doubled, the endowment grew
from $350 million to more than $3 billion, the annual operating budget rose from $177
million to more than $650 million, and annual research funding improved from $15 million
to more than $70 million. [75] Notre Dame's most recent (2014) capital campaign raised
$2. 014 billion, far exceeding its goal of $767 million. It was the largest in the
history of Catholic higher education, and the largest of any university without a
medical school at the time. [78] John I. Jenkins took over from Malloy in 2005. [79][80]
In his inaugural address, Jenkins described his goals of making the university a leader
in research that recognizes ethics and builds the connection between faith and studies.
During his tenure, Notre Dame has increased its endowment, enlarged its student body,
and undergone many construction projects on campus, including the Compton Family Ice
Arena, a new architecture hall, and additional residence halls. [81] Announced as
an integration of "the academy, student life and athletics, "[82] construction on
the 750, 000 sq ft (70, 000 m2) Campus Crossroads project began around Notre Dame
Stadium in November 2014. Its three buildings house student life services, an indoor
gym, a recreation center, the career center, a 500-seat student ballroom, the departments
of anthropology and psychology, a digital media center and the department of music
and sacred music program. [83] Jenkins announced the 2023â€“2024 academic year would
be his last as president in October 2023. The board of trustees subsequently elected
Robert A. Dowd to succeed him, effective June 1, 2024. [84][85] Notre Dame's campus
is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana. [86]
It lies on 1, 250 acres (510 ha), south of the Indiana Toll Road and includes around
170 buildings and athletic fields located around its two lakes and seven quadrangles.
[87] It is consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful university campuses in
the United States and around the world, and it is noted particularly for the Golden
Dome, the Basilica and its stained glass windows, the quads and the greenery, the
Grotto, the Hesburgh Library with its Word of Life stone mural (nicknamed "Touchdown
Jesus" by students), and its statues and museums. [89][90][91][92][93] Notre Dame

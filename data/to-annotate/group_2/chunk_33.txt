on 18 fixed bus routes within the city. The organization reports over 2 million trips per year (5, 400 trips per day) on its fixed routes. Wichita Transit also operates a demand response paratransit service with 320, 800 passenger trips annually. [259] A 2005 study ranked Wichita near the bottom of the fifty largest American cities in terms of percentage of commuters using public transit. Only 0. 5% used it to get to or from work. [260] Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus service northeast to Topeka and south to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Bus service is provided daily north towards Salina and west towards Pueblo, Colorado by BeeLine Express (subcontractor of Greyhound Lines). [261][262] The Greyhound bus station that was built in 1961 at 312 S Broadway closed in 2016, and services relocated 1 block northeast to the Wichita Transit station at 777 E Waterman. [263] The Wichita Airport Authority manages the city's two main public airports, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport and Colonel James Jabara Airport. [264] Located in the western part of the city, Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport is the city's primary airport as well as the largest airport in Kansas. [68][264] Seven commercial airlines (Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, Frontier, Southwest & United) serve Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport with non-stop flights to several U. S. airline hubs. [265] Jabara Airport is a general aviation facility on the city's northeast side. [266] The city also has several privately owned airports. Cessna Aircraft Field and Beech Factory Airport, operated by manufacturers Cessna and Beechcraft, respectively, lie in east Wichita. [267][268] Two smaller airports, Riverside Airport and Westport Airport, are in west Wichita. [269][270] The first train arrived in Wichita on May 16, 1872 from Newton with 44 passengers. Numerous passenger depots served the city up until 1979, with two depots remaining extant. [271] Two Class I railroads, BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad (UP), operate freight rail lines through Wichita. [272] UP's OKT Line runs generally north-south through the city; north of downtown, the line consists of trackage leased to BNSF. [68][273] An additional UP line enters the city from the northeast and terminates downtown. [68] BNSF's main line through the city enters from the north, passes through downtown, and exits to the southeast, paralleling highway K-15. [68][274] The Wichita Terminal Association, a joint operation between BNSF and UP, provides switching service on three miles (5 km) of track downtown. [275] In addition, two lines of the Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad enter the city, one from the northwest and the other from the southwest, both terminating at their junction in west-central Wichita. [68] Wichita has not had passenger rail service since 1979. [276] The nearest Amtrak station is in Newton 25 miles (40 km) north, offering service on the Southwest Chief line between Los Angeles and Chicago. [272] Amtrak offers bus service from downtown Wichita to its station in Newton as well as to its station in Oklahoma City, the northern terminus of the Heartland Flyer line. [277] A 2014 study by Walk Score ranked Wichita 41st most walkable of fifty largest U. S. cities. [278] After numerous citizen surveys showed Wichitans want better bicycle infrastructure, The Wichita Bicycle Master Plan, a set of guidelines toward the development of a 149-mile Priority Bicycle Network, was endorsed by the Wichita City Council on February 5, 2013, as a guide to future infrastructure planning and development. As a result, Wichita's bikeways covered 115 miles of the city by 2018. One-third of the bikeways were added between 2011, when the plan was still in development, and 2018. [279][280] Wichita is mentioned in the 1968 hit song "Wichita Lineman" by Glen Campbell. It is also mentioned in the songs "I've Been Everywhere", and "Seven Nation Army". Allen Ginsberg wrote about a visit to Wichita in his poem "Wichita Vortex Sutra", for which Philip Glass subsequently wrote a solo piano piece. [281] The stage play Hospitality Suite takes place in Wichita as does its 1999 film adaptation, The Big Kahuna. [282] The city is the setting for the comic strip Dennis the Menace. [283] The films Wichita (1955) and portions of Wyatt Earp (1994), both of which dramatize the life and career of former Wichita lawman Wyatt Earp, are set in Wichita, [284][285] as were early episodes of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1955-1961), [286][287] the first adult-oriented western TV series. [288][289] The short-lived 1959â€“1960 television western Wichita Town was set during the city's early years. [290] Other films wholly or partially set in the city include Good Luck, Miss Wyckoff (1979), [291] Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987), [292] The Ice Harvest (2005), [293] and Knight and Day (2010). In the 2016 remake of The Magnificent Seven, the lead character is identified as a Wichita lawman. [294][295] Wichita's Old Cowtown Museum, a re-creation of early Wichita, has served as a setting for various western- and pioneer-themed films, [296] including two of the Sarah Plain and Tall trilogy. [297][298] A Wichita-area airport served as settings for The Gypsy Moths. [299][300]

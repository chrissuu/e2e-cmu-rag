[196] Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey
into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied
operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland, and to invade
France in 1944. [197] By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost
conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting
severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners. [198] Despite
stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces, the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually
captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile. [199] On 16 April, in Burma,
7, 000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle
of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division. [200] Japanese forces achieved
naval victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea, and Indian Ocean, [201] and bombed
the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success
against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha. [202] These easy victories over the
unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, and overextended. [203]
In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture Port Moresby by amphibious
assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and
Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on
two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle
of the Coral Sea. [204] Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid,
was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated;
as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.
[205] In mid-May, Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in China, with the goal
of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in
the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese
23rd and 32nd Army Groups. [206][207] In early June, Japan put its operations into
action, but the Americans had broken Japanese naval codes in late May and were fully
aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive
victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy. [208] With its capacity for aggressive
action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan attempted to capture
Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua. [209] The Americans
planned a counterattack against Japanese positions in the southern Solomon Islands,
primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing Rabaul, the main Japanese
base in Southeast Asia. [210] Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, the
Battle for Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were
ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the island,
where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Bunaâ€“Gona. [211]

concerts, carnival rides, attractions, and food vendors. [91] Sturgis on the River is a large annual gathering of motorcycles which includes bands and food vendors. [92] Other local expositions include River Roots Live, Beaux Arts Fair and many others. Davenport (along with neighboring Rock Island, Illinois), won the 2007 City Livability Award in the small-city category from the U. S. Conference of Mayors. Tom Cochran, executive director of the Conference, stated that the award "gives the Conference a chance to highlight mayoral leadership in making urban areas safer, cleaner and more livable. "[93] The award acknowledges achievements from the RiverVision plan of Davenport and Rock Island. [94] Davenport and the Quad Cities are home to many sports teams. The Quad Cities River Bandits baseball team play games at Downtown Davenport's Modern Woodmen Park. The TaxSlayer Center in Moline is home the Quad City Steamwheelers indoor football team and the Quad City Storm hockey team. Davenport high schools are in the Mississippi Athletic Conference for sports. Davenport has over fifty parks or recreational trails. [95] Major parks include Credit Island, which is a 450-acre (1. 8 km2) park in southwest Davenport located alongside the Mississippi River. [95] Fejervary Park contains a pool and has had approximately 20, 000 visitors each year since 1996. [95] Junge Park is situated along the Duck Creek Parkway and includes baseball and softball fields, sand volleyball, and basketball courts. [95] LeClaire Park is located right on the banks of the Mississippi River next to Modern Woodmen Park and hosts many summer events including River Roots Live and Ribfest. [96] Bands for the Bix Fest play in the park each July. Vander Veer Botanical Park welcomes approximately 25, 000 visitors to continuous floral shows. [95] The city features two recreational trails for biking or walking. Duck Creek Parkway extends from Emeis Park in west Davenport 8. 26 miles (13. 29 km) east to Bettendorf along Duck Creek. Riverfront Parkway extends 4. 75 miles (7. 64 km) along the Mississippi waterfront from Credit Island to Bettendorf. Both these trails continue into Bettendorf. [95] Plans are being discussed to connect the two trails in Riverdale. [97] Three public golf courses are offered in the city. [98] For river-related activities, The Channel Cat boat offers rides across the river and has two stops in Iowa and three stops in Illinois and connects the bike paths that each state has on its river front. [99] Davenport uses a mayorâ€“council form of local government. As of 2021[update], city government consists of mayor Mike Matson[100] and a ten-person council. One person is elected from each of the eight wards and two at-large aldermen are elected to represent the whole city. [101] Nonpartisan elections are held in odd-numbered years. The mayor is the top elected individual for the city and presides over city council meetings, voting in case of a tie. The mayor appoints city board members. [102] The city council's job is to make laws and set the city budget. [103] The city administrator, currently Corrin Spiegel, is appointed by the mayor with confirmation by two-thirds of the council. Citywide goals through 2012 include having a financially responsible government, having a growing economy, revitalizing neighborhoods, and upgrading city infrastructure and public facilities. [104] The establishment of Davenport as a political and government unit came in 1839, three years after the city was settled. [105] The city was incorporated as a result of a resolution by Iowa Representative Jonathan W. Parker by special charter in the Iowa Territory on January 25, 1839. [105] Parker was a resident of Davenport and one of six trustees elected to govern the city with Rodolphus Bennet being the first mayor. Activity for the first four months was minimal as the council failed to meet. [105] In 1842, the city charter was amended for the first time. Changes include having six alderman replace the five trustees, dividing the city into three wards, and appointing a city clerk position to replace the recorder. [105] The charter was amended again in 1851 to expand the city area, provide greater detail of the duties of the mayor, city council, and other officials. [105] During the last half of the 19th century, government assumed expanding responsibilities for public welfare and public works improvements. The city expanded police protection, even temporarily having volunteer police officers to assist the three paid officers. [105] Fire protection was expanded in 1882, with the city's first 13 paid firefighters. [105] Former mayor Henry Vollmer accomplished several public works achievements, including large street paving and new sub-divisions being plotted. [105] A large city budget surplus brought the creation of the Davenport City Hall. [106] After 1900, each mayor brought new agendas for city improvement. Waldo Becker encouraged new railroads for the city. He also promised a more business-like government, in terms of financial responsibility and to depoliticize the police department. In the mid-1920s the city established the first zoning ordinances, electrical traffic signals and street lighting. The city also expanded with the incorporation of the city of Rockingham and the establishment of the Davenport Municipal Airport. [106] The 2010 fiscal year budget was $199. 2 million, [71] an increase of $35 million from 2009. [71] The city's general fund receives the largest amount of funds from property taxes, followed by service fees such as solid waste collection and swimming pool or golf course admission and 80% of its expenses go to personnel costs. [71] The city has given a few surveys for citizens to rate the quality of life and city services. The largest department in the city is the public works department with a budget of $36. 7 million. [71] The police department is second with a budget of $22. 4 million, while the fire department has a budget of $15 million. [71] The parks department has $6. 1 million, and the Davenport Public Library has a $3. 8 million budget. [71] At the federal level, Davenport is in Iowa's 1st congressional district. It is represented by Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks. The two Senators are Republicans Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst. At the state level, Davenport is represented by the 45th, 46th, and 47th Iowa Senate districts and in the Iowa House of Representatives by the 89th, 90th, 92nd, 93rd, and 94th districts. [107] As of 2012[update], the 41st senate district covers the eastern third of the city and all of Bettendorf, Riverdale, and Panorama Park. It is more conservative than other Davenport districts being represented by a Republican since the 1970s. The district is slightly moving more liberal with an increase of 3, 000 Democrats between 2006 and 2010. [108] The district is represented by Republican Senator Roby Smith. [109] The 42nd district covers the western third of the city along with all of Scott County that is not in Davenport, Bettendorf, Riverdale, or Panorama Park as well as western and southern rural Clinton County and is represented by Republican Senator Shawn Hamerlinck. [110] The 43rd senate district covers the central third of the city and is represented by Democrat Joe Seng.

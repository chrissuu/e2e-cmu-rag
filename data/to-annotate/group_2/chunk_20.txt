not ensure general objectivity since historians have to interpret and synthesize facts
to arrive at an overall narrative describing large trends and developments. [190]
As a result, some historians, such as G. M. Trevelyan and Keith Jenkins, assert that
all history is biased, arguing that historical narratives are never free of subjective
presuppositions and value judgments. [191] Some outlooks associated with realism,
empiricism, and reconstructionism, [192] conceptualise history as the search for truth
or knowledge, which they see as recoverable through rigorous evaluation and careful
interpretation of evidence. [193][t] Other scholars critique this view, emphasising
the subjective and partial nature of historical knowledge. [u] Perspectivists claim
that historical perspectives are inherently subjective, as they require selecting
particular sources and inquiries, and ascertaining what information can be regarded
as historical fact. They argue that statements can only be objective within or relative
to one of several competing historical perspectives. [198] A stronger scepticist or
relativist outlook states that no historical knowledge can be proven objective. [199][v]
This emphasis on subjectivities has been extended by postmodernist theories that suggest
that it is impossible to know the past objectively, adding that meaning is created
through human-made texts, the language of which "constitute our world as we perceive
it". [201][w] Neo-realists have responded to this trend by reemphasising the centrality
of empiricist methodologies to historical analysis. They acknowledge the influence
of subjective evaluations but contend that historical truth is reachable nonetheless.
[203][x] History is part of the school curriculum in most countries. [204] Early history
education aims to make students interested in the past and familiarize them with fundamental
concepts of historical thought. By fostering a basic historical awareness, it seeks
to instil a sense of identity by helping them understand their cultural roots. [205]
It often takes a narrative form by presenting children with simple stories, which
may focus on historic individuals or the origins of local holidays, festivals, and
food. [206] More advanced history education encountered in secondary school covers
a broader spectrum of topics, ranging from ancient to modern history, at both local
and global levels. It further aims to acquaint students with historical research methodologies,
including the abilities to interpret and critically evaluate historical claims. [207]
History teachers employ a variety of teaching methods. They include narrative presentations
of historical developments, questions to engage students and prompt critical thinking,
and discussions on historical topics. Students work with historical sources directly
to learn how to analyse and interpret evidence, both individually and in group activities.
They engage in historical writing to develop the skills of articulating their thoughts
clearly and persuasively. Assessment through oral or written tests aims to ensure
that learning goals are reached. [208] Traditional methodologies in history education
often present numerous facts, like dates of significant events and names of historical
figures, which students are expected to memorize. Some modern approaches, by contrast,
seek to foster a more active engagement and a deeper interdisciplinary understanding

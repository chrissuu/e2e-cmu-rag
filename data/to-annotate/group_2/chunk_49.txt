in a survey in 2021. [387] Some people have multiple ethnic identities, such as both Turk and Kurd. [392][393] In 2006, an estimated 2. 7 million ethnic Turks and Kurds were related from interethnic marriages. [394] According to the World Factbook, non-Kurdish ethnic minorities are 7–12% of the population. [5] In 2006, KONDA estimated that non-Kurdish and non-Zaza ethnic minorities constituted 8. 2% of the population; these were people who gave general descriptions such as Turkish citizen, people with other Turkic backgrounds, Arabs, and others. [386] In 2021, 4% of adult citizens identified as non-ethnic Turk or non-ethnic Kurd in a survey. [387] According to the Constitutional Court, there are only four officially recognized minorities in Turkey: the three non-Muslim minorities recognized in the Treaty of Lausanne (Armenians, Greeks, and Jews[d]) and the Bulgarians. [e][398][399][400] In 2013, the Ankara 13th Circuit Administrative Court ruled that the minority provisions of the Lausanne Treaty should also apply to Assyrians in Turkey and the Syriac language. [401][402][403] Other unrecognized ethnic groups include Albanians, Bosniaks, Circassians, Georgians, Laz, Pomaks, and Roma. [404][405][406] The official language is Turkish, which is the most widely spoken Turkic language in the world. [407][408] It is spoken by 85%[409][410] to 90%[411] of the population as a first language. Kurdish speakers are the largest linguistic minority. [411] A survey estimated 13% of the population speak Kurdish or Zaza as a first language. [409] Other minority languages include Arabic, Caucasian languages, and Gagauz. [411] The linguistic rights of the officially recognized minorities are de jure recognized and protected for Armenian, Bulgarian, Greek, Hebrew, [f][395][398][399][400] and Syriac. [402][403] There are multiple endangered languages in Turkey. Excluding Syrians under temporary protection, there were 1, 570, 543 foreign citizens in Turkey in 2023. [8] Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Turkey and the Kurdish areas of Iran during the Gulf War in 1991. Turkey's migrant crisis in the 2010s and early 2020s resulted in the influx of millions of refugees and immigrants. [412] Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees in the world as of April 2020. [413] The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency manages the refugee crisis in Turkey. Before the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the estimated number of Arabs in Turkey varied from 1 million to more than 2 million. [414] In November 2020, there were 3. 6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey; [415] these included other ethnic groups of Syria, such as Syrian Kurds[416] and Syrian Turkmens. [417] As of August 2023, the number of these refugees was estimated to be 3. 3 million. The number of Syrians had decreased by about 200, 000 people since the beginning of the year. [418] The government has granted citizenship to 238 thousand Syrians by November 2023. [419] As of May 2023, approximately 96, 000 Ukrainian refugees of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine have sought refuge in Turkey. [420] In 2022, nearly 100, 000 Russian citizens migrated to Turkey, becoming the first in the list of foreigners who moved to Turkey, meaning an increase of more than 218% from 2021. [421] Turkey is a secular state with no official state religion; the constitution provides for freedom of religion and conscience. [425][426] According to the CIA World Factbook, Muslims constitute 99. 8% of the population, most of them being Sunni. [5] Based on a survey, KONDA's estimate for Muslims was 99. 4% in 2006. [427] According to Minority Rights Group International, estimates of share of Alevi are between 10% and 40% of the population. [428] KONDA's estimate was 5% in 2006. [427] 4% of adult citizens identified as Alevi in a survey in 2021, while 88% identified as Sunni. [387] The percentage of non-Muslims in modern-day Turkey was 19. 1% in 1914, but fell to 2. 5% in 1927. [429] Currently, non-Muslims constitute 0. 2% of the population according to the World Factbook. [5] In 2006, KONDA's estimate was that 0. 18% of the population adhered to non-Islamic religions. [427] Some of the non-Muslim communities are Armenians, Assyrians, Bulgarian Orthodox, Catholics, Greeks, Jews, and Protestants. [430] Sources estimate that the Christian population in Turkey ranges between 180, 000 and 320, 000. [431][432] Turkey has the largest Jewish community among the Muslim-majority countries. [433] Currently, there are 439 churches and synagogues in Turkey. [434] In 2006, KONDA estimated that 0. 47% of the population had no religion. [427] According to KONDA, the share of adult citizens who identified as nonbelievers increased from 2% in 2011 to 6% in 2021. [387] A 2020 Gezici Araştırma poll found that 28. 5% of the Generation Z identified as irreligious. [435][436] In the past 20 years, Turkey has improved quality of education and has made significant progress in increasing education access. [438] From 2011 to 2021, improvements in education access include significant rise in the rates of upper secondary and tertiary education completion, and quadrupling of pre-school institutions. [439] PISA results suggest improvements in education quality. [439] There is still a gap with OECD countries. Significant challenges include differences in student outcomes from different schools, differences between rural and urban areas, pre-primary education access, and arrival of students who are Syrian refugees. [439] The Ministry of National Education is responsible for pre-tertiary education. [440] Compulsory education is free at public schools and lasts 12 years, divided into three parts. [441][438] There are 208 universities in Turkey. [371] Students are placed to universities based on their YKS results and their preferences, by the Measuring, Selection and Placement Center. [442] All state and private universities are under the control of the Higher Education Board. Since 2016, the president of Turkey directly appoints all rectors of all state and private universities. [443] According to the 2024 Times Higher Education ranking, the top universities were Koç University, Middle East Technical University, Sabancı University, and Istanbul Technical University. [444] According to Academic Ranking of World Universities, the top ones were Istanbul University, University of Health Sciences (Turkey), and Hacettepe University. [445] For foreign students, Turkey has become a regional hub, [446] with a large number of international students[447] and international scholarships. [448][449][450] The Ministry of Health has run a universal public healthcare system since 2003. [452] Known as Universal Health Insurance (Genel Sağlık Sigortası), it is funded by a tax surcharge on employers, currently at 5%. [452] Public-sector funding covers approximately 75. 2% of health expenditures. [452] Despite the universal health care, total expenditure on health as a share of GDP in 2018 was the lowest among OECD countries at 6. 3% of GDP, compared to the OECD average of 9. 3%. [452] There are many private hospitals in the country. [453] The government planned several hospital complexes, known as city hospitals, to be constructed since 2013. [453] Turkey is one of the top 10 destinations for health tourism. [454] Average life expectancy is 78. 6 years (75. 9 for males and 81. 3 for females), compared with the EU average of 81 years. [452] Turkey has high rates of obesity, with 29. 5% of its adult population having a body mass index (BMI) value of 30 or above. [455] Air pollution is a major cause of early death. [456] In the 19th century, Turkish identity was debated

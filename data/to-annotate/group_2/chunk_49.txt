under anonymous control. This was particularly useful during the COVID-19 pandemic
because the BMGF already knew which organizations were working in the field and able
to receive funds. [34] When former President Trump threatened to defund the WHO in
summer 2020 over concerns that it was too "deferential" to the Chinese Communist Party,
because the BMGF constituted at that time the second-ranked contributor to the WHO,
concerns were raised in the charity and academic sector that the BMGF might conceivably
bias the WHO in the pursuit of its ideology. In the most timely accounting period,
the BMGF provided 45% of the WHO's NGO funds, or in other words 12% of the total operating
expenditure of the WHO. [35][36] It was revealed after the fact that the BMGF had
contributed US$1. 553 billion to the GAVI over the five years (from 2016 to 2020).
The BMGF was the number two ranked contributor. [37] At the Global Vaccine Summit
in June 2020, the BMGF pledged $1. 6 billion (or just under 20% of the total) for
the subsequent five years. [38] In May 2022, the Gates Foundation announced the commitment
of $125 million to aid in ending the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and to aid
in preparing for future pandemics. In total since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic
the Gates Foundation has committed more than $2 billion to COVID-19 response efforts.
[39] In 2015, it co-funded a community known as Agriculture, Nutrition and Health
Academy in partnership with the United Kingdom Aid from the UK government. [40] In
July 2021, the foundation agreed on a back-up plan in the event that its co-chairs
could not work together due to their recent divorce. The deal gave Bill and Melinda
a two-year trial, after which Melinda could resign from the organization and receive
personal resources from her ex-husband for her own charity work. [41][42] On May 13,
2024, Melinda Gates resigned as co-chair of the foundation, to be effective June 7,
2024. [43][42] The foundation was renamed to the Gates Foundation in January 2025,
[44] with Bill Gates as the sole chairman. [42] The New York Times wrote in August
2025 that the Gates Foundation had "quietly ceased backing" a network of organizations
associated with Arabella Advisors which is a for-profit consulting company that serves
as the hub of a politically liberal "dark money" network. The foundation specifically
said that it would cease "making grants to nonprofit funds administered by the consulting
firm Arabella Advisors". According to the report, the Gates Foundation had been a
very significant donor to Arabella-allied the New Venture Fund and the Sixteen Thirty
Fund. [45] Over a sixteen-year period, the Gates Foundation had disbursed or pledged
about $450 million to Arabella Advisors-associated organizations. [46] In June 2006,
Warren Buffett pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million Berkshire Hathaway
Class B shares (then valued at $3, 071 each, before a 50â€“1 stock split in 2010) spread

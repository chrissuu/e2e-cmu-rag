younger son’s last resort as a career. While he was vegetating on a small family property
in Cornwall , which he called a “cursed hiding-place” in one of his many letters to
his adored sister and confidante , clever Nan (Ann) Pitt, help came from a politically
powerful millionaire nobleman, Lord Cobham, who lived in splendour in a palatial mansion
and vast park at Stowe, in Buckinghamshire , to which William and his friends paid
visits. Cobham sent William abroad on “The Grand Tour” of Europe (only France and
Switzerland were visited, however) and later bought him a cornetcy—a commission—in
his own regiment of horse (1731). Early political career In 1735 Pitt was offered
one of the “pocket” borough s his brother controlled, in Wiltshire , and entered Parliament
. He belonged to the small group known as “Cobham’s cubs” and the “boy patriots, ”
the connection of family friends and place hunters whom Cobham was mobilizing to oppose
the ministry of Sir Robert Walpole (later the 1st earl of Orford). Walpole had governed
England since 1720, monopolizing patronage, and had—they thought—become too ready
to compromise in foreign affairs for the sake of peace. The “patriots” joined other
discontented Whigs such as John Carteret (later Earl Granville ) and William Pulteney
(later the 1st earl of Bath ) to rally opposition forces behind Frederick Louis ,
prince of Wales , who was vehemently estranged from his father, King George II . There
were no formal political parties in the 18th century, and political power, together
with the financial opportunities it brought, was a gift of patronage from a handful
of landowning family oligarchies and from the monarch himself; nor was there a formal
opposition in Parliament, and opposition to the king’s ministry was regarded as factious
and even traitorous. Pitt’s maiden speech in Parliament was so critical of the ministry
that it provoked Walpole to deprive him of his military commission, to “muzzle this
terrible young cornet of horse. ” In 1737 the Prince of Wales made Pitt one of his
court officials with a salary of £400 a year. He was still a relatively poor dependent
of a powerful Whig clan but already showed an independence of mind and a readiness
to appeal to public opinion outside Parliament that were new in English political
life: when Walpole dismissed him from his cornetcy, he ostentatiously drove about
London in a one-horse chaise to underline his poverty. His talents as an orator had
already become clear. He repeatedly referred to the “voice of England, ” which had
to be sought outside Parliament because Parliament was so packed with placemen and
sinecurists. He claimed to speak for the commercial interests and even for the colonies
overseas, the latter scarcely represented in the Commons . He was using arguments
that carried far beyond the close interests of the Whig families; but he made lasting
and valuable friendship with the rich sugar planter-aldermen of the City of London

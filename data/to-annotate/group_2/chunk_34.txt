The National Basketball League (NBL) was one of the oldest professional basketball leagues created in the United States. Originally established in 1935 during what was considered to be the height of the Great Depression as the Midwest Basketball Conference, it changed its name to the NBL on October 6, 1937, weeks before it was set to begin what was to have been its third season of play under that name, effectively becoming a proper professional league in the process. Before the NBL was created, the best basketball teams were created as barnstorming operations like the former ABL Original Celtics team, the New York Renaissance, the Harlem Globetrotters, and the Philadelphia Sphas (the last of whom also played in the original rivaling American Basketball League as well after previously being of the Eastern Basketball League). [1] After the 1948–49 season, its twelfth and final season of existence under that name, it ended up merging operations with the more newly established Basketball Association of America (BAA) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA) to hold many of the best professional basketball teams for the modern-day era, with the BAA being considered both the official recordholders and the starting point of the NBA over the longer-lasting NBL (despite its longer starting point), with few recognitions from the NBL's days being properly recognized by the NBA in the present day. Five current NBA teams trace their history back to the NBL: the Atlanta Hawks (formerly the Buffalo Bisons/Tri-Cities Blackhawks), the Detroit Pistons (formerly the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons), the Los Angeles Lakers (formerly the Detroit Gems/Minneapolis Lakers), the Philadelphia 76ers (formerly the Syracuse Nationals), and the Sacramento Kings (formerly the Rochester Royals, though their earliest history went as far back as 1923 by the days of the Rochester Seagrams), with five former BAA/NBA teams also tracing their roots to the NBL in the Indianapolis Jets (formerly the Indianapolis Kautskys), the Anderson Packers (formerly the Anderson Duffey Packers), the original Denver Nuggets (not to be confused with the current Denver Nuggets NBA team that exists from the former Denver Rockets ABA team), the Sheboygan Red Skins, and the Waterloo Hawks, as well as one more team that was originally meant to be an NBL expansion team later joining the NBA as an expansion team instead in the Indianapolis Olympians. Another NBL team that's still presently surviving to this day, albeit not as a professional team, are the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots, who previously survived after leaving the NBL during World War II to become a National Industrial Basketball League team before later becoming an Amateur Athletic Union Elite club to this very day. The NBL was initially founded as the Midwest Basketball Conference (MBC) in 1935. The league was created by Frank Kautsky (who owned Kautsky's Grocery store in Indianapolis) and Paul Sheeks (who was the athletic and recreation director for the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio), who both wanted to resurrect a defunct professional basketball league that both teams Kautsky and Sheeks owned and operated (which were the Indianapolis Kautskys and Akron Firestone Non-Skids respectively) had played for during the 1932–33 season called the National Professional Basketball League (which had started out with nine teams competing there (with teams joining the Indianapolis Kautskys and Akron Firestone Non-Skids (supposedly named the Akron Firestones at that time) including the Toledo Crimson Coaches (the only other winning team that season), the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots (supposedly named the Akron Goodyear Webfoots that season), Fort Wayne Chiefs, Muncie Whys, South Bend Guardsmen, Kokomo Kelts, and Lorain Fisher Foods), but went down to five teams near the end of its sole season of play following the dropouts of Lorain, Kokomo, Muncie, and South Bend, with the Goodyear team only having 6 games played in that league[2]), but they admittedly created the new league with no real plan of action outside of being what can be considered an amateur or semi-professional basketball league of sorts (with the players there also working for the sponsorship they had played for under this time) with good competition in mind. One of the ways they made sure the sport was competitive was by eliminating rules that basketball previously had slowed the game down significantly (such as having a jump ball after every foul shot, if not every shot in general), which helped make sure the game's action remained consistent with its flow in its first season (with the following season later removing jump balls after every basket made in general), as well as implementing rules that would (mostly) be used to help become the set predecessors for modern-era basketball to this day as opposed to the roughhouse sport that it was considered to be back in that period of time. [3] Games played in at least their first season were done on the weekends (usually Sunday afternoons) since teams could schedule non-league games on later days of their weeks, partially due to blue laws in the United States and appealing to people in relation to them. During their two seasons under the Midwest Basketball Conference name, they had a total of 16 different teams competing throughout the league (though two of them were slated to be a rebranding of a different team from the first to the second season[4]), with as many as 12 teams, but as few as 8 (later 9) teams competing at any given time during their regular seasons. The teams that competed in the MBC mostly involved business-owned teams (alongside the aforementioned Kautskys and Firestone Non-Skids, businesses like Hed-Aids, U. S. Tire, Inc. , the Young Men's Hebrew Association (labeled as the Y. M. H. A. ), the Dayton Metropolitan Clothing Stores, Cooper Buses (being the only Canadian-based team to enter the MBC coming from Windsor, Ontario, thus making the MBC the first ever international basketball league in existence ahead of the Basketball Association of America), and the Duffy Florals later on had teams in their inaugural season, with Goodyear, Altes Lagers (representing a rebranding from the Hed-Aids to the Atles Lagers for the Detroit franchise), the Miami Valley Brewing Company (representing a rebranding from the Metropolitans to the London Bobbys[5]), the Columbus Athletic Supply (using the same name for their team), General Electric, and HyVis Oil (being referred to as HyVis Oilers sometimes) having teams for the following season afterward, with Seagram initially having the Rochester Seagrams (later Sacramento Kings) be included there before reneging on joining the MBC due to travel concerns[6]) being joined alongside a couple of independently ran teams in the Buffalo Bisons barnstorming team (though they previously played in the original American Basketball League

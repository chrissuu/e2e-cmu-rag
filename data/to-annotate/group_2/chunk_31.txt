Ineligibility for citizenship prevented Asian immigrants from accessing a variety
of rights, such as voting. [106] Bhicaji Balsara became the first known Indian-born
person to gain naturalized US citizenship. [107] Balsara's naturalization was not
the norm but an exception; in a pair of cases, Ozawa v. United States (1922) and United
States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (1923), the Supreme Court upheld the racial qualification
for citizenship and ruled that Asians were not "white persons". Second-generation
Asian Americans, however, could become US citizens due to the birthright citizenship
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; this guarantee was confirmed as applying regardless
of race or ancestry by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898).
[108] From the 1880s to the 1920s, the United States passed laws inaugurating an era
of exclusion of Asian immigrants. While the overall number of Asian immigrants was
relatively small compared to those from other regions, their concentration in the
West contributed to the rise of nativist sentiment, often referred to as the "yellow
peril. " Congress passed restrictive legislation which prohibited nearly all Chinese
immigration to the United States in the 1880s. [109] Japanese immigration was sharply
curtailed by a diplomatic agreement in 1907. The Asiatic Barred Zone Act in 1917 further
barred immigration from nearly all of Asia, the "Asiatic Zone". [110] The Immigration
Act of 1924 provided that no "alien ineligible for citizenship" could be admitted
as an immigrant to the United States, consolidating the prohibition of Asian immigration.
[111] President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, resulting
in the internment of Japanese Americans, among others. Over 100, 000 people of Japanese
descent, mostly on the West Coast, were forcibly removed, in an action later considered
ineffective and racist. [112] Japanese Americans were kept isolated in military camps
just because of their race, including children, old persons and the young generation.
'Issei: The first generation' and 'Children of the camps' are two great documentaries
representing the situation of Japanese Americans during World War II. World War II-era
legislation and judicial rulings[which? ] gradually increased the ability of Asian
Americans to immigrate and become naturalized citizens. Immigration rapidly increased
following the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965
as well as the influx of refugees from conflicts occurring in Southeast Asia such
as the Vietnam War. Asian American immigrants have a significant percentage of individuals
who have already achieved professional status, a first among immigration groups. [113]
The number of Asian immigrants to the United States "grew from 491, 000 in 1960 to
about 12. 8 million in 2014, representing a 2, 597 percent increase. "[114] Asian
Americans were the fastest-growing racial group between 2000 and 2010. [89][115] By
2012, more immigrants came from Asia than from Latin America. [116] In 2015, Pew Research
Center found that from 2010 to 2015 more immigrants came from Asia than from Latin
America, and that since 1965; Asians have made up a quarter of all immigrants to the

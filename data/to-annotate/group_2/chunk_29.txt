VII Park, the second-largest park in the city following the Parque Florestal de Monsanto
(Monsanto Forest Park), extends down the main avenue (Avenida da Liberdade), with

named Parque da Liberdade, it was renamed in honour of Edward VII who visited Lisbon
in 1903. Lisbon is home every year to the Lisbon Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, [113]

of Portuguese azulejo tile art, a use of ceramic tile as an architectural finish for
both building interiors and exteriors dating from the 15th Century. This art form
is celebrated in Lisbon's National Museum of the Azulejo and as a station feature
in the Lisbon metro. In addition, the mosaic Portuguese pavement (Calçada Portuguesa)
was born in Lisbon, in the mid-1800s. The art has since spread to the rest of the
Portuguese Speaking world. The city remains one of the most expansive examples of
the technique, nearly all walkways and even many streets being created and maintained
in this style. In May 2018, the city hosted the 63rd edition of the Eurovision Song
Contest, after the victory of Salvador Sobral with the song "Amar pelos dois" in Kyiv
on 13 May 2017. World Youth Day 2023 was hosted in August of that year in Lisbon,
attracting hundreds of thousands of young Catholics from over 140 countries. [121]

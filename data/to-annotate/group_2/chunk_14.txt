made it an attractive target for litigation, culminating in Intel agreeing to pay
AMD $1. 25 billion and grant them a perpetual patent cross-license in 2009 as well
as several anti-trust judgements in Europe, Korea, and Japan. [200] A case of industrial
espionage arose in 1995 that involved both Intel and AMD. Bill Gaede, an Argentine
formerly employed both at AMD and at Intel's Arizona plant, was arrested for attempting
in 1993 to sell the i486 and P5 Pentium designs to AMD and to certain foreign powers.
[201] Gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at Intel and mailed it to AMD,
which immediately alerted Intel and authorities, resulting in Gaede's arrest. Gaede
was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison in June 1996. [202][203] In 2023,
Dell accounted for about 19% of Intel's total revenues, Lenovo accounted for 11% of
total revenues, and HP Inc. accounted for 10% of total revenues. [206] As of May 2024,
the U. S. Department of Defense is another large customer for Intel. [207][208][209][210]
In September 2024, Intel reportedly qualified for as much as $3. 5 billion in federal
grants to make semiconductors for the Defense Department. [211] According to IDC,
while Intel enjoyed the biggest market share in both the overall worldwide PC microprocessor
market (73. 3%) and the mobile PC microprocessor (80. 4%) in the second quarter of
2011, the numbers decreased by 1. 5% and 1. 9% compared to the first quarter of 2011.
[212][213] Intel's market share decreased significantly in the enthusiast market as
of 2019, [214] and they have faced delays for their 10 nm products. According to former
Intel CEO Bob Swan, the delay was caused by the company's overly aggressive strategy
for moving to its next node. [72] In the 1980s, Intel was among the world's top ten
sellers of semiconductors (10th in 1987[215]). Along with Microsoft Windows, it was
part of the "Wintel" personal computer domination in the 1990s and early 2000s. In
1992, Intel became the biggest semiconductor chip maker by revenue[216] and held the
position until 2018 when Samsung Electronics surpassed it, but Intel returned to its
former position the year after. [217] Other major semiconductor companies include
TSMC, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, ASML, STMicroelectronics, United Microelectronics
Corporation (UMC), Micron, SK Hynix, Kioxia, and SMIC. Intel's competitors in PC chipsets
included AMD, VIA Technologies, Silicon Integrated Systems, and Nvidia. Intel's competitors
in networking include NXP Semiconductors, Infineon, [needs update] Broadcom Limited,
Marvell Technology Group and Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, and competitors in
flash memory included Spansion, Samsung Electronics, Qimonda, Kioxia, STMicroelectronics,
Micron, SK Hynix, and IBM. The only major competitor in the x86 processor market is
AMD, with which Intel has had full cross-licensing agreements since 1976: each partner
can use the other's patented technological innovations without charge after a certain
time. [218] However, the cross-licensing agreement is canceled in the event of an
AMD bankruptcy or takeover. [219] Some smaller competitors, such as VIA Technologies,

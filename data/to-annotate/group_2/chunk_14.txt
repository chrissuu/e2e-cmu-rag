analysed the relationship between GDP and reduction in budget deficits for several European countries in April 2012 and concluded that austerity was slowing growth, similar to Martin Wolf. He also wrote: ". .. this also implies that 1 euro of austerity yields only about 0. 4 euros of reduced deficit, even in the short run. No wonder, then, that the whole austerity enterprise is spiraling into disaster. "[111] Britain's decision to leave the European Union in 2016 has been partly attributed to the after-effects of the Great Recession on the country. [112][113][114][115][116] During the Great Recession and in the immediate aftermath, Bangladesh, Ukraine, Honduras, Guatemala, Palestine, and Hong Kong went from democracies to a mix of democracy and authoritarianism and Madagascar, the Gambia, Ethiopia, Russia, and Fiji went from mixed regimes to authoritarian ones. While each country had democratic backsliding for different reasons, economic calamity has long been known to contribute to instability that can cause authoritarian forces to take hold. [117] Poland was the only member of the European Union to avoid a GDP recession during the Great Recession. As of December 2009, the Polish economy had not entered recession nor even contracted, while its IMF 2010 GDP growth forecast of 1. 9 percent was expected to be upgraded. [120][121][122] Analysts identified several causes for the positive economic development in Poland: Extremely low levels of bank lending and a relatively small mortgage market; the relatively recent dismantling of EU trade barriers and the resulting surge in demand for Polish goods since 2004; Poland being the recipient of direct EU funding since 2004; lack of over-dependence on a single export sector; a tradition of government fiscal responsibility; a relatively large internal market; the free-floating Polish zloty; low labour costs attracting continued foreign direct investment; economic difficulties at the start of the decade, which prompted austerity measures in advance of the world crisis. [citation needed] While India, Uzbekistan, China, and Iran experienced slowing growth, they did not enter recessions. South Korea narrowly avoided technical recession in the first quarter of 2009. [123] The International Energy Agency stated in mid September that South Korea could be the only large[clarify] OECD country to avoid recession for the whole of 2009. [124] Australia avoided a technical recession after experiencing only one quarter of negative growth in the fourth quarter of 2008, with GDP returning to positive in the first quarter of 2009. [125][126] The 2008 financial crisis did not affect developing countries to a great extent. Experts see several reasons: Africa was not affected because it is not fully integrated in the world market. Latin America and Asia seemed better prepared, since they have experienced crises before. In Latin America, for example, banking laws and regulations are very stringent. Bruno Wenn of the German DEG suggests that Western countries could learn from these countries when it comes to regulations of financial markets. [127] The few recessions appearing early in 2006–07 are commonly never associated to be part of the Great Recession, which is illustrated by the fact that only two countries (Iceland and Jamaica) were in recession in Q4 2007. One year before the maximum, in Q1 2008, only six countries were in recession (Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Portugal and New Zealand). The number of countries in recession was 25 in Q2 2008, 39 in Q3 2008 and 53 in Q4 2008. At the steepest part of the Great Recession in Q1 2009, a total of 59 out of 71 countries were simultaneously in recession. The number of countries in recession was 37 in Q2 2009, 13 in Q3 2009 and 11 in Q4 2009. One year after the maximum, in Q1 2010, only seven countries were in recession (Greece, Croatia, Romania, Iceland, Jamaica, Venezuela and Belize). The recession data for the overall G20 zone (representing 85% of all GWP), depict that the Great Recession existed as a global recession throughout Q3 2008 until Q1 2009. Subsequent follow-up recessions in 2010–2013 were confined to Belize, El Salvador, Paraguay, Jamaica, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand and 24 out of 50 European countries (including Greece). As of October 2014, only five out of the 71 countries with available quarterly data (Cyprus, Italy, Croatia, Belize and El Salvador), were still in ongoing recessions. [16][128] The many follow-up recessions hitting the European countries, are commonly referred to as being direct repercussions of the European debt crisis. Iceland fell into an economic depression in 2008 following the collapse of its banking system (see 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis). By mid-2012 Iceland is regarded as one of Europe's recovery success stories largely as a result of a currency devaluation that has effectively reduced wages by 50%--making exports more competitive. [129] The following countries had a recession starting in the fourth quarter of 2007: United States. [16] The following countries had a recession starting in the first quarter of 2008: Latvia, [130] Ireland, [131] New Zealand, [132] and Sweden. [16] The following countries/territories had a recession starting in the second quarter of 2008: Japan, [133] Hong Kong, [134] Singapore, [135] Italy, [136] Turkey, [16] Germany, [137] United Kingdom, [16] the Eurozone, [138] the European Union, [16] and the OECD. [16] The following countries/territories had a recession starting in the third quarter of 2008: Spain, [139] and Taiwan. [140] The following countries/territories had a recession starting in the fourth quarter of 2008: Switzerland. [141] South Korea avoided recession with GDP returning positive at a 0. 1% expansion in the first quarter of 2009. [142] Of the seven largest economies in the world by GDP, only China avoided a recession in 2008. In the year to the third quarter of 2008 China grew by 9%. Until recently Chinese officials considered 8% GDP growth to be required simply to create enough jobs for rural people moving to urban centres. [143] This figure may more accurately be considered to be 5–7% now[when? ] that the main growth in working population is receding. [citation needed] Ukraine went into technical depression in January 2009 with a GDP growth of −20%, when comparing on a monthly basis with the GDP level in January 2008. [144] Overall the Ukrainian real GDP fell 14. 8% when comparing the entire part of 2009 with 2008. [145] When measured quarter-on-quarter by changes of seasonally adjusted real GDP, Ukraine was more precisely in recession/depression throughout the four quarters from Q2-2008 until Q1-2009 (with respective qoq-changes of: -0. 1%, -0. 5%, -9. 3%, -10. 3%), and the two quarters from Q3-2012 until Q4-2012 (with respective qoq-changes of: -1. 5% and -0. 8%). [146] Japan was in recovery in the middle of the decade 2000s but slipped back into recession and deflation in 2008. [147] The recession in Japan intensified in the fourth quarter of 2008 with a GDP growth of −12. 7%, [148] and deepened further in the first quarter of 2009 with a GDP growth of −15. 2%. [149] On February 26, 2009, an Economic Intelligence Briefing was added to the daily intelligence briefings prepared for the President of the United States. This addition reflects the assessment of U. S. intelligence agencies that the 2008 financial crisis presented a serious threat to international stability. [150] Business Week stated in March 2009 that global political instability

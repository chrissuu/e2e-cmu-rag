[citation needed] The Constitutional Court is composed of 15 members, elected for single 12-year terms. They are obliged to retire when they are over the age of 65. [186] Turkish politics have become increasingly associated with democratic backsliding, being described as a competitive authoritarian system. [187][188] Elections in Turkey are held for six functions of government: presidential (national), parliamentary (national), municipality mayors (local), district mayors (local), provincial or municipal council members (local), and muhtars (local). Referendums are also held occasionally. Every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 has the right to vote and stand as a candidate at elections. [citation needed] Universal suffrage for both sexes has been applied throughout Turkey since 1934. [189] In Turkey, turnout rates of both local and general elections are high compared to many other countries, which usually stands higher than 80%. [citation needed] President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is currently serving as the head of state and head of government. [190][191] Özgür Özel is the Main Opposition Leader. The last parliamentary and presidential elections were in 2023. The Constitutional Court can strip the public financing of political parties that it deems anti-secular or having ties to terrorism, or ban their existence altogether. [192][193] The electoral threshold for political parties at national level is seven percent of the votes. [194] Smaller parties can avoid the electoral threshold by forming an alliance with other parties. Independent candidates are not subject to an electoral threshold. On the right side of the Turkish political spectrum, parties like the Democrat Party, Justice Party, Motherland Party, and Justice and Development Party became the most popular political parties in Turkey, winning numerous elections. Turkish right-wing parties are more likely to embrace the principles of political ideologies such as conservatism, nationalism or Islamism. [195] On the left side of the spectrum, parties like the Republican People's Party, Social Democratic Populist Party and Democratic Left Party once enjoyed the largest electoral success. Left-wing parties are more likely to embrace the principles of socialism, Kemalism or secularism. [196] With the founding of the Republic, Turkey adopted a civil law legal system, replacing Sharia-derived Ottoman law. The Civil Code, adopted in 1926, was based on the Swiss Civil Code of 1907 and the Swiss Code of Obligations of 1911. Although it underwent a number of changes in 2002, it retains much of the basis of the original Code. The Criminal Code, originally based on the Italian Criminal Code, was replaced in 2005 by a Code with principles similar to the German Penal Code and German law generally. Administrative law is based on the French equivalent and procedural law generally shows the influence of the Swiss, German and French legal systems. [197] Islamic principles do not play a part in the legal system. [198] Law enforcement in Turkey is carried out by several agencies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. These agencies are the General Directorate of Security, the Gendarmerie General Command and the Coast Guard Command. [199] In the years of government by the Justice and Development Party and Erdoğan, particularly since 2013, the independence and integrity of the Turkish judiciary has increasingly been said to be in doubt by institutions, parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside of Turkey, because of political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors and in their pursuit of public duty. [200][201][202] Turkey has been characterized as an emerging[203] or rising, [204] a middle, [205] a quasi-regional, [206] and a regional power. [207][208] Turkey's constant foreign policy goal is to pursue its national interests. These interests are mainly growing the economy, and maintaining security from internal terrorist and external threats. [209] After the establishment of the Republic, Atatürk and İnönü followed the "peace at home, peace in the world" principle until the Cold War's start. [210] Following threats from the Soviet Union, Turkey sought to ally with the United States and joined NATO in 1952. [211][210] Overall, Turkey aims for good relations with Central Asia, the Caucasus, Russia, the Middle East, and Iran. With the West, Turkey also aims to keep its arrangements. [212] By trading with the east and joining the EU, Turkey pursues economic growth. [212] Turkey joined the European Union Customs Union in 1995, [213] but its EU accession talks are frozen as of 2024. [214] Turkey has sought closer relations with the Central Asian Turkic states after the breakup of the Soviet Union. [215] Closer relations with Azerbaijan, a culturally close country, was achieved. [215] Turkey is a founding member of the International Organization of Turkic Culture and Organization of Turkic States. [216][217] It is also a member of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Council of Europe, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. [218] Following the Arab Spring, Turkey had problems with countries such as United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. [219] Relations with these countries have improved since then. [219][220][221] There are disputes with Greece over maritime boundaries and with Cyprus. [222] In 2018, the Turkish military and the Turkish-backed forces began an operation in Syria aimed at ousting US-backed YPG (which Turkey considers to be an offshoot of the outlawed PKK)[223][224] from the enclave of Afrin. [225][226] Turkey has also conducted airstrikes in Iraqi Kurdistan, which was criticized by Iraq for violating its sovereignty and killing civilians. [227] Diplomatic relations with Israel were damaged after the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, [228] normalized in 2016, [229] and cut again following the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. [230] In 2024, Turkey stopped trading with Israel. [230] The Turkish Armed Forces are responsible for defense against foreign threats. While the Commander-in-Chief is the President, General Staff, Air Force, Naval Force, and Land Force usually report to the Minister of National Defence. [234] The Gendarmerie General Command and the Coast Guard Command are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. [235] Military service is required for 6–12 months for men, [236] which is reduced to one month after paying a fee. [237] Turkey does not recognize conscientious objection and does not offer a civilian alternative to military service. [238] Turkey has the second-largest military force in NATO, after the United States, with an estimated strength of 890, 700 military personnel as of February 2022. [239] Turkey is considered a significant power in unmanned aerial vehicles. [240] As part of the nuclear sharing policy of NATO, Turkey hosts approximately 20 United States B61 nuclear bombs at the Incirlik Air Base. [241][242] In recent years, Turkey's defense industry has developed rapidly. [243] Aselsan, Turkish Aerospace Industries, Roketsan, and ASFAT are among the top 100 defense companies in the world. [244] Turkey has participated in international missions under the United Nations and NATO since the Korean War, including peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Yugoslavia and the Horn of Africa. It supported coalition forces in the First Gulf War, contributed military personnel to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, and remains active in Kosovo Force, Eurocorps and EU Battlegroups. [245][246] As of 2016, Turkey has assisted Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq and the Somali Armed Forces with security and training. [247][248] The Turkish Armed Forces have a relatively substantial military presence abroad, [249] with military bases in Albania, [250] Iraq, [251] Qatar, [252]

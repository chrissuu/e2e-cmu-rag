cost him support in his own party. . .. To a certain point, he sort of reached a lame-duck
status". [37] The list has also generated controversy over inclusions. In 2005, conservative
commentator Ann Coulter was listed, which led Salon to observe: When Time magazine
named Ann Coulter among its 100 "most influential people" last week, alongside such
heavyweights as Ariel Sharon, Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela, and the Dalai Lama, the
choice produced guffaws online. Plugging the issue on Fox News last week, Time executive
editor Priscilla Painton insisted it was Coulter's use of "humor" that made her so
influential, stopping just short of suggesting that Coulter is the conservative Jon
Stewart. But even Fox's Bill O'Reilly wasn't buying it. He pressed Painton: "Do you
think people, Americans, listen to Ann Coulter? Do you think she has influence in
public opinion? "[38] Time defended Coulter as a best-selling author whose controversial
commentary strongly affected political debates in the United States. Coulter did not,
however, make additional appearances on the list. In February 2016, Time included
the male British author Evelyn Waugh on its "100 Most Read Female Writers in College
Classes" list, generating media attention and concerns regarding fact-checking at
the magazine. [39] Time later issued a retraction. In a BBC interview with Justin
Webb, Oxford professor Valentine Cunningham said the mistake was "a piece of profound
ignorance on the part of Time magazine". [40] Since 2014, in partnership with Rolex,
Time has published a class of young pioneers "in politics, business, culture, science
and sports" who are reshaping the world around them. [41] It is, per the magazine's
editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal, "an opportunity to elevate" the trailblazers "who
are building a better future". [42][43] Included in the 2022 list was Lina Abu Akleh,
a human rights advocate who is the niece of Shireen Abu Akleh, a journalist likely
killed by Israeli soldiers. [44] From 2015 to 2019, Time also published a list titled
"The 25 Most Influential People on the Internet", which featured people whose influence
and dominance may have changed Internet culture; who have support, position, and prominence
in various sections of social media; or who use and/or rely on the Internet as a platform
for change. People who have been listed range from political figures, such as Donald
Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to teenage YouTubers, such as JoJo Siwa and Emma
Chamberlain. [45] Others who have been listed include Lil Nas X, whose debut hit broke
the record for most weeks spent atop the Billboard Hot 100 after being created and
distributed on the Internet, [46] and actress and presenter Jameela Jamil, who is
known widely beyond her profession for her online activism. [45] In 2019, Time began
publishing the Time 100 Next list, which "spotlights 100 rising stars who are shaping
the future of business, entertainment, sports, politics, science, health and more".
[3] It is considered an expansion of the current Time 100 list. [47] Although the

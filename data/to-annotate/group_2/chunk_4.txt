men and women and decreased with age. [264] In a 2016 US survey of 1, 584 people,
"66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than
the average human driver". People were worried about safety and hacking risk. Nevertheless,
only 13% of the interviewees saw no advantages in this new kind of cars. [265] In
a 2017 survey of 4, 135 US adults found that many Americans anticipated significant
impacts from various automation technologies including the widespread adoption of
automated vehicles. [266] In 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187
US adults respectively were published. The questionnaire was termed the autonomous
vehicle acceptance model (AVAM), including additional description to help respondents
better understand the implications of various automation levels. Users were less accepting
of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use autonomous
vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring
uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.
[267] In 2022, a survey reported that only a quarter (27%) of the world's population
would feel safe in self-driving cars. [268] In 2024, a study by Saravanos et al. [269]
at New York University reported that 87% of their respondents (from a sample of 358)
believed that conditionally automated cars (at Level 3) would be easy to use. The
regulation of autonomous cars concerns liability, approvals, and international conventions.
In the 2010s, researchers openly worried that delayed regulations could delay deployment.
[270] In 2020, UNECE WP. 29 GRVA was issued to address regulation of Level 3 automated
driving. Vehicles operating below Level 5 still offer many advantages. [271] As of
2023[update] most commercially available ADAS vehicles are SAE Level 2. A couple of
companies reached higher levels, but only in restricted (geofenced) locations. [272]
SAE Level 2 features are available as part of the ADAS systems in many vehicles. In
the US, 50% of new cars provide driver assistance for both steering and speed. [273]
Ford started offering BlueCruise service on certain vehicles in 2022; the system is
named ActiveGlide in Lincoln vehicles. The system provided features such as lane centering,
street sign recognition, and hands-free highway driving on more than 130, 000 miles
of divided highways. The 2022 1. 2 version added features including hands-free lane
changing, in-lane repositioning, and predictive speed assist. [274][275] In April
2023 BlueCruise was approved in the UK for use on certain motorways, starting with
2023 models of Ford's electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. [276] Tesla's Autopilot and its
Full Self-Driving (FSD) ADAS suites are available on all Tesla cars since 2016. FSD
offers highway and street driving (without geofencing), navigation/turn management,
steering, and dynamic cruise control, collision avoidance, lane-keeping/switching,
emergency braking, obstacle avoidance, but still requires the driver to remain ready
to control the vehicle at any moment. Its driver management system combines eye tracking
with monitoring pressure on the steering wheel to ensure that drives are both eyes

people in Boca Costa, in the Southern portions of Guatemala, as well as the Western Highlands living together in close communities. [236] Within these communities and outside of them, around 23 Indigenous languages (or Native American Indigenous languages) are spoken as a first language. Of these 23 languages, they only received official recognition by the Government in 2003 under the Law of National Languages. [235] The Law on National Languages recognizes 23 Indigenous languages including Xinca, enforcing that public and government institutions not only translate but also provide services in said languages. [237] It would provide services in Cakchiquel, Garifuna, Kekchi, Mam, Quiche, and Xinca. [238] The Law of National Languages has been an effort to grant and protect Indigenous peoples' rights not afforded to them previously. Along with the Law of National Languages passed in 2003, in 1996 the Guatemalan Constitutional Court had ratified the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. [239] The ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, is also known as Convention 169. Which is the only International Law regarding Indigenous peoples that Independent countries can adopt. The convention establishes that governments like Guatemala must consult with Indigenous groups before any projects occur on tribal lands. [240] About 5 percent of the population is of full-blooded Indigenous descent, but as much as 80 percent of Hondurans are mestizo or part-Indigenous with European admixture, and about 10 percent are of Indigenous or African descent. [241] The largest concentrations of Indigenous communities in Honduras are in the westernmost areas facing Guatemala and along the coast of the Caribbean Sea, as well as on the border with Nicaragua. [241] The majority of Indigenous people are Lencas, Miskitos to the east, Mayas, Pech, Sumos, and Tolupan. [241] About 5 percent of the Nicaraguan population is Indigenous. The largest Indigenous group in Nicaragua is the Miskito people. Their territory extended from Cabo Camarón, Honduras, to La Cruz de Rio Grande, Nicaragua along the Mosquito Coast. There is a native Miskito language, but large numbers speak Miskito Coast Creole, Spanish, Rama, and other languages. Their use of Creole English came about through frequent contact with the British, who colonized the area. Many Miskitos are Christians. Traditional Miskito society was highly structured, politically and otherwise. It had a king, but he did not have total power. Instead, the power was split between himself, a Miskito Governor, a Miskito General, and by the 1750s, a Miskito Admiral. Historical information on Miskito kings is often obscured by the fact that many of the kings were semi-mythical. Another major Indigenous culture in eastern Nicaragua is the Mayangna (or Sumu) people, counting some 10, 000 people. [242] A smaller Indigenous culture in southeastern Nicaragua is the Rama. Other Indigenous groups in Nicaragua are located in the central, northern, and Pacific areas and they are self-identified as follows: Chorotega, Cacaopera (or Matagalpa), Xiu-Subtiaba, and Nicarao. [243] Indigenous peoples of Panama, or Native Panamanians, are the Native peoples of Panama. As of the 2023 census, Indigenous peoples constitute 17. 2% of Panama's population of 4. 5 million, totaling just over 698, 000 individuals. The Ngäbe and Buglé comprise half of the Indigenous peoples of Panama. [244] Many of the Indigenous Peoples live on comarca indígenas, [245] which are administrative regions for areas with substantial Indigenous populations. Three comarcas (Comarca Emberá-Wounaan, Guna Yala, Ngäbe-Buglé) exist as equivalent to a province, with two smaller comarcas (Guna de Madugandí and Guna de Wargandí) subordinate to a province and considered equivalent to a corregimiento (municipality). In 2005, the Indigenous population living in Argentina (known as pueblos originarios) numbered about 600, 329 (1. 6% of the total population); this figure includes 457, 363 people who self-identified as belonging to an Indigenous ethnic group and 142, 966 who identified themselves as first-generation descendants of an Indigenous people. [246] The ten most populous Indigenous peoples are the Mapuche (113, 680 people), the Kolla (70, 505), the Toba (69, 452), the Guaraní (68, 454), the Wichi (40, 036), the Diaguita–Calchaquí (31, 753), the Mocoví (15, 837), the Huarpe (14, 633), the Comechingón (10, 863) and the Tehuelche (10, 590). Minor but important peoples are the Quechua (6, 739), the Charrúa (4, 511), the Pilagá (4, 465), the Chané (4, 376), and the Chorote (2, 613). The Selkʼnam (Ona) people are now virtually extinct in its pure form. The languages of the Diaguita, Tehuelche, and Selkʼnam nations have become extinct or virtually extinct: the Cacán language (spoken by Diaguitas) in the 18th century and the Selkʼnam language in the 20th century; one Tehuelche language (Southern Tehuelche) is still spoken by a handful of elderly people. In Bolivia, the 2012 National Census reported that 41% of residents over the age of 15 are of Indigenous origin. Some 3. 7% report growing up with an Indigenous mother tongue but do not identify as Indigenous. [247] When both of these categories are totaled, and children under 15, some 66. 4% of Bolivia's population was recorded as Indigenous in the 2001 Census. [248] The 2021 National Census, recognizes 38 cultures, each with its language, as part of a pluri-national state. Some groups, including CONAMAQ (the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu), draw ethnic boundaries within the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking population, resulting in a total of 50 Indigenous peoples native to Bolivia. The largest Indigenous ethnic groups are Quechua, about 2. 5 million people; Aymara, 2 million; Chiquitano, 181, 000; Guaraní, 126, 000; and Mojeño, 69, 000. Some 124, 000 belong to smaller Indigenous groups. [249] The Constitution of Bolivia, enacted in 2009, recognizes 36 cultures, each with its language, as part of a pluri-national state. Some groups, including CONAMAQ (the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu), draw ethnic boundaries within the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking population, resulting in a total of 50 Indigenous peoples native to Bolivia. Large numbers of Bolivian highland peasants retained Indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of "empowered caciques" to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953. [250] While the National Revolutionary Movement government began in 1952 and discouraged people identifying as Indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s. [251] Many lowland Indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and giving official titles to Indigenous territories. The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted "grassroots territorial organizations; " these are recognized by the state and have certain rights to govern local areas. Some radio and television programs are produced in the Quechua and Aymara languages. The constitutional reform in 1997 recognized Bolivia as a multi-lingual, pluri-ethnic society and introduced education reform. In 2005, for the first time in the country's history, an Indigenous Aymara, Evo Morales, was elected as president. Morales began work on his "Indigenous autonomy" policy, which he launched in the eastern

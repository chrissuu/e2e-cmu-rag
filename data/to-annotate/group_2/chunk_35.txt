Institute developed a method to weaponise chlorine. [g][259] The use of chemical weapons
had been sanctioned by the German High Command to force Allied soldiers out of their
entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional
weapons. [259] Chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout
the war, inflicting approximately 1. 3 million casualties, of which about 90, 000
were fatal. [259] The use of chemical weapons in warfare was a direct violation of
the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention
on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use. [260][261] The ethnic cleansing of the
Ottoman Empire's Armenian population, including mass deportations and executions,
during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered genocide. [263] The Ottomans
carried out organised and systematic massacres of the Armenian population at the beginning
of the war and manipulated acts of Armenian resistance by portraying them as rebellions
to justify further extermination. [264] In early 1915, several Armenians volunteered
to join the Russian forces and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue
the Tehcir Law (Law on Deportation), which authorised the deportation of Armenians
from the Empire's eastern provinces to Syria between 1915 and 1918. The Armenians
were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by Ottoman brigands.
[265] While the exact number of deaths is unknown, the International Association of
Genocide Scholars estimates around 1. 5 million. [263][266] The government of Turkey
continues to deny the genocide to the present day, arguing that those who died were
victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War I; these claims
are rejected by most historians. [267] Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked
by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some
scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination. [268][269][270]
At least 250, 000 Assyrian Christians, about half of the population, and 350, 000–750,
000 Anatolian and Pontic Greeks were killed between 1915 and 1922. [271] About 8 million
soldiers surrendered and were held in POW camps during the war. All nations pledged
to follow the Hague Conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival
rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front. [272]
Around 25–31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed)
were to prisoner status; for Austria-Hungary 32%; for Italy 26%; for France 12%; for
Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1. 4 million
(not including Russia, which lost 2. 5–3. 5 million soldiers as prisoners). From the
Central Powers, about 3. 3 million soldiers became prisoners; most of them surrendered
to Russians. [273] Allied personnel was around 42, 928, 000, while Central personnel
was near 25, 248, 000. [216] British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers
but were increasingly conscripted. Surviving veterans returning home often found they

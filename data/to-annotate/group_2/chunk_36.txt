committees, which consist of Acousticafé, AnTostal, Community Engagement, Concerts, First Look Into Programming (FLIP), Live Entertainment, and Signature Events. [271] The Hall Presidents Council (HPC) is responsible for planning, funding, and executing residence hall events. The council is composed of leadership from all of Notre Dame's undergraduate residence halls, in addition to council leaders. [272] The Club Coordination Council (CCC) is responsible for communicating issues facing undergraduate club issues, providing funding for undergraduate clubs, serving as the representative body of undergraduate student clubs, and working with student clubs to ensure that clubs can coordinate their programming of activities. [273] The CCC oversees around 400 student clubs, [274] each of which serves a unique purpose. [275][276] The approval of the council, along with that of the Notre Dame Student Activities Office, is a requirement for official recognition of student clubs. [277][278][279] There are four Class Councils, one representing each undergraduate class level: First-Year, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior Class Councils. They each promote the wellbeing of their respective classes by sponsoring functions that promote unity among class members. Each class is represented by four elected class officers, including a President, Vice-President, Treasurer, and Secretary. In addition to the officers, the Class Councils are made up of members from all across campus that work together to plan events. [280] The Off-Campus Council represents any undergraduate students not residing on the campus of the university. They provide to the needs of those students, given that the issues differ from those residing in the dorms. [281] The Financial Management Board (FMB) is responsible for the creation and maintenance of a budget for the Student Union. FMB conducts an annual hearing to ensure that undergraduate funds are allocated fairly, known as the Annual Allocation Hearing. The FMB representative from each organization prepares a budget and then meets with the Student Union Treasurer to discuss their organization's monetary needs, which are presented at the Annual Allocation Hearing. [282] After the allocations are agreed upon by its members, the budget is proposed to the Senate Committee on the Budget, which either approves or rejects these allocations. [283] The Judicial Council is tasked with overseeing the ethical behavior of Student Union leaders, maintaining the constitutional conduct of the Student Union, administering its elections, and providing support through Peer Advocates to students navigating the Office of Community Standards' hearings and conferences. [284] Website BestColleges. com ranks the university's intramural sports program as number one in the country in 2021. [285] Over 700 teams participate each year in the annual Bookstore Basketball tournament; [286] while the Notre Dame Men's Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament to raise money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh. [287] In the fall, the Notre Dame Women's Boxing Club hosts an annual Baraka Bouts tournament that raises money for the Congregation of the Holy Cross Missions in Uganda. [288] Many of the most popular student events held on campus are organized by the 33 residential halls. Among these, the most notable are the Keenan Revue, the Fisher Hall Regatta, Howard Hall Totter for Water, Keenan Hall Muddy Sunday, the Morrissey Hall Medallion Hunt, the Dillon Hall Pep Rally, the Keough Hall Chariot Race and many others. Each dorm also hosts many formal and informal balls and dances each year. [289] While having a religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, over 93 percent of students identify as Christian, with over 80 percent of those being Catholic. [290] There are 57 chapels on campus, including one in every residence hall. Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus, and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community. [257][291][292] There is also an active council of the Knights of Columbus on campus, which is the oldest and largest college council of the international Catholic men's organization. [293][294] Non-Catholic religious organizations on campus include the Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM), Jewish Club of Notre Dame, the Muslim Student Association, the Orthodox Christian Fellowship, the Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, and many more. [274] The university is the major seat of the Congregation of Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which are in Rome). [295] Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is on the campus across St. Joseph Lake from the Main Building. [296] Old College, the oldest building on campus near the shore of St. Mary's Lake, houses undergraduate seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former retreat center), Holy Cross House, and Columba Hall near the Grotto. [297] Notre Dame students run nine media outlets: three newspapers, a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. The Scholastic magazine, begun as a one-page journal in 1876, [298] is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. [299] The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, [300] staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the university. [301] In 2003, when other students believed that the paper had a liberal bias, they started The Irish Rover, a print and digital newspaper published twice per month that features regular columns from alumni and faculty and coverage of campus matters. As of 2005, The Observer and the Irish Rover were distributed to all students. [299] In Spring 2008, Beyond Politics, an undergraduate journal for political science research, made its debut. [302] In May 2023, a professor at the university, Tamara Kay, sued the Rover for defamation. The case was dismissed, and Kay filed an appeal in February 2024. [303] WSND-FM serves the student body and the larger South Bend community at 88. 9 FM, offering students a chance to become involved in bringing classical music, fine arts and educational programming, and alternative rock to the airwaves. Another radio station, WVFI, began as a partner of WSND-FM; it now airs independently and is streamed on the Internet. [304] The television station (NDtv) grew from one show in 2002 to a full 24-hour channel with original programming by 2006. [305] Notre Dame's sports teams are known as the Fighting Irish. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports—except football and hockey —since the 2013–14 school year. Men's ice hockey is played in the Big Ten conference. [306] Notre Dame men compete in baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. Women's sports are basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The football team competes as a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Independent[307] since its inception in 1887, except for 2020, when it competed as part of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Both fencing teams compete in the Midwest Fencing Conference. [308] Notre Dame's

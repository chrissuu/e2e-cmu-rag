money from his skills. And athletes should as far as possible have the opportunities
other students enjoy. ” [49] Pro 2: College athletes are risking their bodies as well
as their future careers and earning potential to play for colleges and universities
while often receiving a sub-par education. Governor of California Gavin Newsom, stated,
“Collegiate student athletes put everything on the line — their physical health, future
career prospects and years of their lives to compete. Colleges reap billions from
these student athletes’ sacrifices and success but, in the same breath, block them
from earning a single dollar. That’s a bankrupt model. ” [3] Zachary Kerr, Researcher
at the University of North Carolina’s Center for the Study of Retired Athletes, stated,
“I definitely think research indicates strong evidence that injuries during one’s
sports career can potentially be associated with adverse health outcomes later in
life. ” [21] In 2017, 67% of former Division I athletes had sustained a major injury
and 50% had chronic injuries, 2. 5% higher than non-athletes. [21] Azmatullah Hussaini,
President of the New York/New Jersey chapter of the American Muslim Health Professionals,
and Jules Lipoff, Assistant Professor of Dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania
Perelman School of Medicine, offered additional context: especially during the COVID-19
pandemic, “[g]iven that athletes are disproportionately Black in the biggest revenue-generating
sports — football and basketball — this dynamic also evokes America’s horrific history
of unpaid slave labor. It’s hard to ignore the racist undertones when the financial
benefit to these institutions is based on the unpaid work of young Black men. ” [22]
The NCAA requires players to have health insurance but does not pay for that insurance
and can refuse to pay medical expenses for sports injuries, some of which can have
life-long consequences for the players’ bodies and career opportunities. The NCAA
also does not prohibit schools from canceling injured athletes’ scholarships, leaving
athletes without a sport or education. [23] Adding insult to sometimes literal injury,
college athletes are also frequently denied the NCAA’s other form of “compensation”:
a quality education. As Jon Solomon, Editorial Director for the Sports and Society
Program at the Aspen Institute explained, “The most glaring example occurred when
the University of North Carolina was found by outside parties to have organized fake
classes that enabled dozens of athletes to gain and maintain their eligibility… of
the 3, 100 students who took the fake classes over 18 years, 47. 4 percent were athletes…
North Carolina avoided NCAA penalties by essentially arguing that the NCAA should
stay out of irregularities in college courses. ” [24] The NCAA polices athletes’ finances
but does not ensure a quality education. Pro 3: College athletes are often valued
at more than $1 million, but they (and their families) frequently live below the poverty
line. Pro 3 College athletes are often valued at more than $1 million, but they (and

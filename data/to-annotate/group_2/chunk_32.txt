ForbesWoman, a quarterly magazine published by Steve Forbes's daughter, Moira Forbes, with a companion Web site. [18] The company formerly published American Legacy magazine as a joint venture, although that magazine separated from Forbes on May 14, 2007. [39] The company also formerly published American Heritage and Invention & Technology magazines. After failing to find a buyer, Forbes suspended publication of these two magazines as of May 17, 2007. [40] Both magazines were purchased by the American Heritage Publishing Company and resumed publication as of the spring of 2008. [41] Forbes has published the Forbes Travel Guide since 2009. [42] In 2013, Forbes licensed its brand to Ashford University, and assisted with the launch of the Forbes School of Business & Technology. [43] CEO Mike Federle justified the licensing in 2018, stating that "Our licensing business is almost a pure-profit business, because it's an annual annuity. "[44] Forbes would launch limited promotions for the school in limited issues. Forbes has never formally endorsed the school. On January 6, 2014, Forbes magazine announced that, in partnership with app creator Maz, it was launching a social networking app called "Stream". Stream allows Forbes readers to save and share visual content with other readers and discover content from Forbes magazine and Forbes. com within the app. [45] David Churbuck founded Forbes's web site in 1996. The site uncovered Stephen Glass's journalistic fraud in The New Republic in 1998, an article that drew attention to internet journalism. [46] At the peak of media coverage of alleged Toyota sudden unintended acceleration in 2010, it exposed the California "runaway Prius" as a hoax, as well as running five other articles by Michael Fumento challenging the entire media premise of Toyota's cars gone bad. The website (like the magazine) publishes lists focusing on billionaires and their possessions, especially real estate. [47][48][21] Forbes. com is part of Forbes Digital, a division of Forbes Media LLC. Forbes's holdings include a portion of RealClearPolitics. Together these sites reach more than 27 million unique visitors each month. Forbes. com employs the slogan "Home Page for the World's Business Leaders" and claimed, in 2006, to be the world's most widely visited business web site. [49] The 2009 Times report said that, while "one of the top five financial sites by traffic [throwing] off an estimated $70 million to $80 million a year in revenue, [it] never yielded the hoped-for public offering". [18] Forbes. com uses a contributor network in which a wide network of freelancers ("contributors") writes and publishes articles directly on the website. [50] Contributors are paid based on traffic to their respective Forbes. com pages; the site has received contributions from over 2, 500 individuals, and some contributors have earned over US$100, 000, according to the company. [50] The contributor system has been criticized for enabling "pay-to-play journalism" and the repackaging of public relations material as news. [51] Forbes currently allows advertisers to publish blog posts on its website alongside regular editorial content through a program called BrandVoice, which accounts for more than 10 percent of its digital revenue. [52] In July 2018, Forbes deleted an article by a contributor who argued that libraries should be closed, and Amazon should open bookstores in their place. [53] As of 2019, the company published 100 articles each day, produced by 3, 000 outside contributors who were paid little or nothing. [54] This business model, in place since 2010, [55] "changed their reputation from being a respectable business publication to a content farm", according to Damon Kiesow, the Knight Chair in digital editing and producing at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. [54] Similarly, Harvard University's Nieman Lab deemed Forbes "a platform for scams, grift, and bad journalism" as of 2022. [51] In 2017, the website blocked internet users using ad blocking software from accessing articles, demanding that the website be put on the ad blocking software's whitelist before access was granted. [56] Forbes argued that this is done because customers using ad blocking software do not contribute to the site's revenue. Malware attacks have been noted to occur from the Forbes site. [57] Forbes won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Business Blog/Website. [58] In November 2019, Forbes launched a streaming platform Forbes8, highlighting notable entrepreneurs and sharing business tips. [59][60][61] In 2020, the network announced the release of several documentary series including Forbes Rap Mentors, Driven Against the Odds, Indie Nation and Titans on the Rocks. [62]

unitary. This time evolution is deterministic in the sense that – given an initial
quantum state ψ ( 0 ) {\displaystyle \psi (0)} – it makes a definite prediction of
what the quantum state ψ ( t ) {\displaystyle \psi (t)} will be at any later time.
[21] Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are independent of
time, such as eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. [7]: 133–137 Many systems that are treated
dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such "static" wave functions.
For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle
moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus, whereas in quantum mechanics,
it is described by a static wave function surrounding the nucleus. For example, the
electron wave function for an unexcited hydrogen atom is a spherically symmetric function
known as an s orbital (Fig. 1). Analytic solutions of the Schrödinger equation are
known for very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians including the quantum harmonic
oscillator, the particle in a box, the dihydrogen cation, and the hydrogen atom. Even
the helium atom – which contains just two electrons – has defied all attempts at a
fully analytic treatment, admitting no solution in closed form. [22][23][24] However,
there are techniques for finding approximate solutions. One method, called perturbation
theory, uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a
result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a
weak potential energy. [7]: 793 Another approximation method applies to systems for
which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior. These
deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion. [7]: 849 One consequence
of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle. In its most familiar
form, this states that no preparation of a quantum particle can imply simultaneously
precise predictions both for a measurement of its position and for a measurement of
its momentum. [25][26] Both position and momentum are observables, meaning that they
are represented by Hermitian operators. The position operator X ^ {\displaystyle {\hat
{X}}} and momentum operator P ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {P}}} do not commute, but rather
satisfy the canonical commutation relation: [ X ^ , P ^ ] = i ℏ . {\displaystyle [{\hat
{X}}, {\hat {P}}]=i\hbar . } Given a quantum state, the Born rule lets us compute
expectation values for both X {\displaystyle X} and P {\displaystyle P} , and moreover
for powers of them. Defining the uncertainty for an observable by a standard deviation,
we have σ X = ⟨ X 2 ⟩ − ⟨ X ⟩ 2 , {\displaystyle \sigma _{X}={\textstyle {\sqrt {\left\langle
X^{2}\right\rangle -\left\langle X\right\rangle ^{2}}}}, } and likewise for the momentum:
σ P = ⟨ P 2 ⟩ − ⟨ P ⟩ 2 . {\displaystyle \sigma _{P}={\sqrt {\left\langle P^{2}\right\rangle
-\left\langle P\right\rangle ^{2}}}. } The uncertainty principle states that σ X σ
P ≥ ℏ 2 . {\displaystyle \sigma _{X}\sigma _{P}\geq {\frac {\hbar }{2}}. } Either

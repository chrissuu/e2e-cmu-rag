Information retrieval (IR) in computing and information science is the task of identifying
and retrieving information system resources that are relevant to an information need.
The information need can be specified in the form of a search query. In the case of
document retrieval, queries can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing.
Information retrieval is the science[1] of searching for information in a document,
searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes
data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds. Automated information retrieval
systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload. An IR system
is a software system that provides access to books, journals and other documents;
it also stores and manages those documents. Web search engines are the most visible
IR applications. An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query
into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search
strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely
identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the
query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance. An object is an entity that is
represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched
against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of
a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the
query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference
of information retrieval searching compared to database searching. [2] Depending on
the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, [3]
audio, [4] mind maps[5] or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or
stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document
surrogates or metadata. Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object
in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The
top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if
the user wishes to refine the query. [6] there is . .. a machine called the Univac

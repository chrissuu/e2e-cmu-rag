to be completed. In 2021, a massive new central park will link the gardens near the CBD and the new convention center to be built just south of it to the North Canadian River as part of a massive works project known as "Core to Shore"; the new park is part of MAPS3, a collection of civic projects funded by a one-cent temporary (seven-year) sales tax increase. [58] Oklahoma City has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa, Trewartha: Cfak), along with significant continental influences. The city features hot, humid summers and cool winters. Prolonged and severe droughts (sometimes leading to wildfires in the vicinity) and hefty rainfall leading to flash flooding and flooding occur regularly. Consistent winds, usually from the south or south-southeast during the summer, help temper the hotter weather. Consistent northerly winds during the winter can intensify cold periods. Severe ice storms and snowstorms happen sporadically during the winter. The average temperature is 61. 4 °F (16. 3 °C), with the monthly daily average ranging from 39. 2 °F (4. 0 °C) in January to 83. 0 °F (28. 3 °C) in July. Extremes range from −17 °F (−27 °C) on February 12, 1899 to 113 °F (45 °C) on August 11, 1936, and August 3, 2012; [59] The last sub-zero (Fahrenheit) reading was −14 °F (−26 °C) on February 16, 2021. [60][61] Temperatures reach 100 °F (38 °C) on 10. 4 days of the year, 90 °F (32 °C) on nearly 70 days, and fail to rise above freezing on 8. 3 days. [60] The city receives about 35. 9 inches (91. 2 cm) of precipitation annually, of which 8. 6 inches (21. 8 cm) is snow. The report "Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U. S. National Climate Assessment" (NCA) from 2013 by NOAA projects that parts of the Great Plains region can expect up to 30% (high emissions scenario based on CMIP3 and NARCCAP models) increase in extreme precipitation days by mid-century. This definition is based on days receiving more than one inch of rainfall. [62] Oklahoma City has an active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to widespread and severe tornadoes, as well as severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes occur every month of the year, and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially in October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by 13 violent tornadoes, eleven rated F/EF4 and two rated F/EF5. [15] On May 3, 1999, parts of Oklahoma City and surrounding communities were impacted by a tornado. It was the last U. S. tornado to be given a rating of F5 on the Fujita scale before the Enhanced Fujita scale replaced it in 2007. While the tornado was in the vicinity of Bridge Creek to the southwest, wind speeds of 318 mph (510 km/h) were estimated by a mobile Doppler radar, the highest wind speeds ever recorded on Earth. [63] A second top-of-the-scale tornado occurred on May 20, 2013; South Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit by an EF5 tornado. The tornado was 0. 5 to 1. 3 miles (0. 80 to 2. 09 km) wide and killed 23 people. [64] On May 31, less than two weeks after the May 20 event, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area. Within Oklahoma City, the system spawned an EF1 and an EF0 tornado, and in El Reno to the west, an EF3 tornado occurred. This lattermost tornado, which was heading in the direction of Oklahoma City before it dissipated, had a width of 2. 6 miles (4. 2 km), making it the widest tornado ever recorded. Additionally, winds over 295 mph (475 km/h) were measured, one of the two highest wind records for a tornado. [65] With 19. 48 inches (495 mm) of rainfall, May 2015 was Oklahoma City's record-wettest month since record-keeping began in 1890. Across Oklahoma and Texas generally, there was a record flooding in the latter part of the month. [66] In the 2010 census, there were 579, 999 people, 230, 233 households, and 144, 120 families in the city. The population density was 956. 4 inhabitants per square mile (321. 9/km2). There were 256, 930 housing units at an average density of 375. 9 per square mile (145. 1/km2). By the 2020 United States census, its population grew to 681, 054. [75] Of Oklahoma City's 579, 999 people in 2010, 44, 541 resided in Canadian County, 63, 723 lived in Cleveland County, 471, 671 resided in Oklahoma County, and 64 resided in Pottawatomie County. [76] In 2010, there were 230, 233 households, 29. 4% of which had children under 18 living with them, 43. 4% were married couples living together, 13. 9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37. 4% were non-families. One person households account for 30. 5% of all households, and 8. 7% of all households had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2. 47 and the average family size was 3. 11. [77] According to the American Community Survey 1-year estimates in 2022, the median income for a household in the city was $63, 713, and the median income for a family was $80, 833. Married-couple families $99, 839, and nonfamily households $40, 521. [78] The per capita income for the city was $35, 902. [79] 15. 5% of the population and 11. 2% of families were below the poverty line. Of the total population, 20. 1% of those under 18 and 10. 6% of those 65 and older lived below the poverty line. [80] In the 2000 census, Oklahoma City's age composition was 25. 5% under the age of 18, 10. 7% from 18 to 24, 30. 8% from 25 to 44, 21. 5% from 45 to 64, and 11. 5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 95. 6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92. 7 males. Oklahoma City has experienced significant population increases since the late 1990s. It is the first city in the state to record a population greater than 600, 000 residents and the first city in the Great Plains region to record a population greater than 600, 000 residents. It is the largest municipal population of the Great Plains region (Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota). [ambiguous] In the 2020 United States census, there were 268, 035 households in the city, out of which 81, 374 households (30. 4%) were individuals, 113, 161 (42. 2%) were opposite-sex married couples, 17, 699 (6. 6%) were unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 2, 930 (1. 1%) were same-sex married couples or partnerships. [81] According to the 2020 census, the racial composition of Oklahoma City was as follows: [83] White or European American 49. 5%, Hispanic or Latino

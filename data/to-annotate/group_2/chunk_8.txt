one cohesive unit. Reducing setup time can increase developer productivity, especially
in cases where learning to use the IDE is faster than manually integrating and learning
all of the individual tools. Tighter integration of all development tasks has the
potential to improve overall productivity beyond just helping with setup tasks. For
example, code can be continuously parsed while it is being edited, providing instant
feedback when syntax errors are introduced, thus allowing developers to debug code
much faster and more easily with an IDE. Some IDEs are dedicated to a specific programming
language, allowing a feature set that most closely matches the programming paradigms
of the language. However, there are many multiple-language IDEs. While most modern
IDEs are graphical, text-based IDEs such as Turbo Pascal were in popular use before
the availability of windowing systems like Microsoft Windows and the X Window System
(X11). They commonly use function keys or hotkeys to execute frequently used commands
or macros. IDEs initially became possible when developing via a console or terminal.
Early systems could not support one, since programs were submitted to a compiler or
assembler via punched cards, paper tape, etc. Dartmouth BASIC was the first language
to be created with an IDE (and was also the first to be designed for use while sitting
in front of a console or terminal). [citation needed] Its IDE (part of the Dartmouth
Time-Sharing System) was command-based, and therefore did not look much like the menu-driven,
graphical IDEs popular after the advent of the graphical user interface. However it
integrated editing, file management, compilation, debugging and execution in a manner
consistent with a modern IDE. Maestro I is a product from Softlab Munich and was the
world's first integrated development environment[1] for software. Maestro I was installed
for 22, 000 programmers worldwide. Until 1989, 6, 000 installations existed in the
Federal Republic of Germany. Maestro was arguably the world leader in this field during
the 1970s and 1980s. Today one of the last Maestro I can be found in the Museum of
Information Technology at Arlington in Texas. One of the first IDEs with a plug-in
concept was Softbench. In 1995 Computerwoche commented that the use of an IDE was
not well received by developers since it would fence in their creativity. As of August
2023[update], the most commonly searched for IDEs on Google Search were Visual Studio,
Visual Studio Code, and Eclipse. [2] The IDE editor usually provides syntax highlighting,
it can show both the structures, the language keywords and the syntax errors with
visually distinct colors and font effects. [3] Code completion is an important IDE
feature, intended to speed up programming. Modern IDEs even have intelligent code
completion. Code completion is an autocompletion feature in many integrated development
environments (IDEs) that speeds up the process of coding applications by fixing common
mistakes and suggesting lines of code. This usually happens through popups while typing,
querying parameters of functions, and query hints related to syntax errors. Code completion

2020, Deloitte's US consulting arm agreed to pay the State of Rhode Island and the US federal government $50 million as a settlement relating to its design of a troubled computer system for its state benefits programs. [139] The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on 29 September 2022 that Shanghai-based Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Certified Public Accountants LLP (Deloitte-China) had agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges relating to failures in complying with requirements for auditing US companies in China and Chinese companies in the US. [140] Deloitte-China, also known as Deloitte Hua Yong, self-reported the deficiencies found in 12 fiscal year 2018 audits. [141] Auditors asked clients to prepare their own paperwork to show that Deloitte-China had completed audits in at least 21 instances, creating the illusion that it followed relevant requirements when there was no evidence of it doing so. [142] For nine clients with operations in China, Deloitte's US office also outsourced its audit work to Deloitte China. [143] Deloitte Consulting has been heavily involved in building unemployment insurance web portals across various US states, including Ohio, Colorado and Illinois. In May 2020, it was revealed that major security weaknesses existed in the web portals of these states. Proposed class actions were filed against the company. [144] This follows similar short-fallings in Florida's unemployment portal. The CONNECT site, designed by Deloitte, was described as a "colossal failure" as it was created over-budget, delivered late, and did not work. In May 2020, an investigation was ordered by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, finding that Deloitte ran insufficient stress testing. [145][146] In September 2017, The Guardian reported that Deloitte suffered a cyberattack that breached the confidentiality of its clients and 244, 000 staff, allowing the attackers to access "usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information". Reportedly, Deloitte had stored the affected data in Microsoft's Azure cloud hosting service, without two-step verification. The attackers were thought to possibly have had access from as early as October 2016. [12] Brian Krebs reported that the breach affected all of Deloitte's email and administrative user accounts. [147][148] A later report by The Wall Street Journal repeated Deloitte's statement that only a few clients were affected. Deloitte reportedly first noticed suspicious activity in April 2017. Deloitte said that its businesses weren't disrupted and no sensitive information was compromised, and that its investigators were eventually able to read every email obtained by the hackers. [149] In October 2017, The Guardian reported that client accounts compromised in the breach included, but were not limited to, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Homeland Security, the US State Department, the US Department of Energy, mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the US Postal Service. [150] Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued statements saying they were not affected by the attack and denied that any of their data was compromised. [151] Deloitte said that it immediately contacted legal authorities and six clients. Deloitte also increased security measures on the advice of both internal and external experts. [152] As of October 2017, the New York attorney general's office was investigating the hack. [149] Deloitte LLP has served as the official professional services sponsor of the United States Olympic Committee since 2009. [153] The UK member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the 2012 Summer Olympics[11] and the Royal Opera House. [154] The Canadian member firm was also the official professional services supplier for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games[155] and 2010 Winter Paralympic Games. [156] In Asia, the Singapore member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. [157] The Australian member firm of Deloitte is a Founding Partner of Invictus Games Sydney 2018, and a Principal from the firm's consulting practice is CEO of the not-for-profit entity delivering the Games. [158][159] Moreover, Deloitte sponsors many university sports teams and societies, such as the Edinburgh University Hockey Club. [160] It also entered into a 3-year partnership with the Cambridge Union Society in November 2013. [161] Deloitte has also delved into motorsport sponsorship, with the team currently acting as the title sponsor for the No. 37 TOM'S Toyota Supra team as TGR Team Deloitte TOM'S in the 2023 Super GT series. [162][163] In May 2017, Deloitte entered into a partnership with McLaren Applied Technologies (MAT) to combine Deloitte's experience in delivering large consulting projects and MAT's experience of engineering, sensors, simulation and analytical analysis. [164] Prior to this, MAT had entered into a similar partnership with competitor KPMG in a ten-year deal in 2014 but it was terminated by KPMG in 2017. [165][166] The partnership was later extended to MAT sister company McLaren Racing in June 2020 where Deloitte will work with McLaren to enhance the performance of the team and its cars. [167] In May 2023, Deloitte and McLaren Racing signed a multi-year partnership extension. [168] In May 2022, Deloitte signed a three-year sponsorship deal worth more than USD300, 000 with the Football Association of Singapore to be the first title sponsor of the Singapore Womenâ€™s Premier League as the Deloitte Women's Premier League.

  "119": "The uncertainty principle is a fundamental limit to knowledge in quantum mechanics, expressed in terms of the standard deviation of position and momentum. It states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. The originator of the uncertainty principle is generally acknowledged to be Werner Heisenberg, who first wrote the principle down in 1927. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The first fully rigorous proof was given by John von Neumann, [ 4 ] although it was also later given in 1930 by F. J. M. Cottingham. [ 5 ] The uncertainty principle is one of the pillars of the quantum revolution in physics, and has been called \"the single most important rule in all of science\". [ 6 ] It is also one of the most misunderstood and misinterpreted scientific principles. The uncertainty principle is not a statement about the fact that measurement devices are necessarily inaccurate, but about the fundamental properties of nature. It is a consequence of the wave nature of matter. A wave can have any position, and a wave can have any momentum, but it cannot have a precisely defined position and a precisely defined momentum. The uncertainty principle can be derived from the commutation",

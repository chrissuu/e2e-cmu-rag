Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [ 18 ]
by the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , who wrote
"My heart is in the work", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie's
vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class
Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design
of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York , founded by industrialist
Charles Pratt in 1887. [ 19 ] In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie
Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time,
CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the
School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and the
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women . The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research
was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon (who went on
to become U. S. Treasury Secretary ) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father,
Thomas Mellon , patriarch of the Mellon family . The Institute began as a research
organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as
a department within the University of Pittsburgh . In 1927, the Mellon Institute was

the Prohibition era , 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit
alcohol consumption. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition,
including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the
Whiskey Rebellion , fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption. [ 53 ]
The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol
trade. During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal
agents engaged in 15, 000 raids, arrested over 18, 000 people and closed down over
3, 000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries. [ 53 ] [ 54
] Even the term " Speakeasy ", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said
to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania . [ 53 ] [
55 ] The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South
Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s. [ 56 ] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened,
becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery. [ 56 ] The Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history. [
57 ] During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense
of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained
about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities
did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution,
seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive
Era and was cleared up in the 1930sâ€“1940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag
until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley. [ 58 ] In November 1927, 28 people
were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank. [ 59 ] To escape
the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods,
a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed "Millionaire's Row" because
of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered
the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe
killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in
damages, and put more than 60, 000 steelworkers out of work. [ 60 ] Oakland became
the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities,
multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's
University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational
building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning . [ 61 ] It towered over Forbes Field
, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970. [ 39 ] Downtown Pittsburgh

of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving

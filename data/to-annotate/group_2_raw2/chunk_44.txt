an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to
the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field
and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President
George Washington sent in militias from several states. [ 20 ] The town continued
to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a
sloop, Western Experiment. [ 26 ] During the next decades, the yards produced other
large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped
goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden
structure on Market Square. [ 11 ] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began. [ 27 ]
Iron City (1800–1859) Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of
early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh
was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country;
the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths
forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population
of 1, 565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat
and shoe shops. [ 11 ] The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In
1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also
flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain,
the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating
American manufacture. [ 11 ] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast
increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions.
By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K
in glass products. [ 11 ] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as
a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture,
and a constant cloud of coal dust . [ 32 ] Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh.
In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling
, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west
commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation
infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge,
opened, the first step in developing the "City of bridges" over its two rivers. [

connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia . In 1834, the Pennsylvania
Main Line Canal was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that
included rivers, roads, and canals. [ 27 ] Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835,
McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already,

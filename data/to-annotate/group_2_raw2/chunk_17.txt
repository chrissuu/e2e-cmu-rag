nor Fowl in Garfield , Bitter Ends Garden & Luncheonette in Bloomfield , and Rolling
Pepperoni in Lawrenceville . [ 184 ] Pittsburgh is home to the annual pickle -themed
festival Picklesburgh . [ 185 ] The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called Pittsburghese
, was influenced by Scots-Irish , German, and Eastern European immigrants and African
Americans. [ 186 ] Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as " Yinzers
" (from the local word "yinz" [var. yunz ], a blended form of "you ones", similar
to "y'all" and "you all" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: "slippy" (slippery),
"redd up" (clean up), "jagger bush" (thorn bush), and "gum bands" (rubber bands).
The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb "to be". In Pittsburghese one would
say "the car needs washed" instead of "needs to be washed", "needs washing", or "needs
a wash. " The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects
of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato
qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European
languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe
Pittsburgh as "the Galapagos Islands of American dialect". [ 187 ] The lexicon itself
contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include

Park, where over 100 species of birds have been recorded. [ 189 ] Residents living

may have occasional floods, [ 190 ] such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane
Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004. [ 191 ] River flooding is relatively rare due to
federal flood control efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs. [
190 ] [ 192 ] [ 193 ] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected
from occasional flooding. The cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the
region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion. [ 190 ] Pittsburgh has the
greatest number of bars per capita in the nation. [ 17 ] Pittsburgh hosted the first
professional football game and the first World Series . College sports also have large
followings with the University of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball
fans with Robert Morris and Duquesne. Pittsburgh has a long history with its major
professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League , the Penguins
of the National Hockey League , and the Pirates of Major League Baseball —which all

Policy The Department of Engineering and Public Policy, informally known as "EPP",
is a pioneering, interdisciplinary academic department within the Carnegie Mellon
University College of Engineering. EPP combines technical analysis with social science
and policy analysis , in order to address problems in which knowledge of technical
details is critical to decision making . The primary purpose of the EPP program is
to educate students to work at the interface of the social and engineering sciences,
through use of an interdisciplinary curriculum based equally on social analysis and
engineering analysis . EPP offers a double-major undergraduate degree, multiple masters
degree programs, and a doctoral studies program. Undergraduate students receive a
Bachelor of Science degree from one of the traditional engineering departments plus
EPP. EPP works in a variety of research areas on problems that involve the interaction
of technology with society. These include: Energy and environment (including climate
); Risk analysis and communication ; Information and communication technology policy;
Management of technical innovation and R&D policy. Across these four focal areas,
the department addresses issues in technology and organizations, and in technology
and economic development , focusing in particular on India and China . EPP also develops
new software tools for the support of policy analysis and research, and studies issues
in engineered systems and security . Fenton, Edwin (2000). Carnegie Mellon 1900-2000:

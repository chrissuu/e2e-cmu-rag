Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development , through the work
of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson , who founded Neighborhood Housing Services
in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America
. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's
existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop. In 1985, the J & L
Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized
High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major
technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon. [ 27 ] In the
1980s, the "Renaissance II" urban revitalization created numerous new structures,
such as PPG Place . In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and
South Side J&L mills were cleared. [ 27 ] In 1992, the new terminal at Pittsburgh
International Airport opened. [ 27 ] In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced
by Heinz Field and PNC Park , despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010,
PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena
in the National Hockey League. [ 93 ] Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national
TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.
[ 94 ] Present-day Pittsburgh, with a diversified economy , a low cost of living,
and a rich infrastructure for medicine and education and culture , has been ranked
as one of the World's Most Livable Cities . [ 95 ] Tourism has recently boomed in
Pittsburgh with nearly 3, 000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently
higher occupancy than in comparable cities. Medicine has replaced steel as a leading
industry. [ 96 ] Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook,
and Intel have joined the 1, 600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh.
As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC),
there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies. The region has also become a leader
in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center.
In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian
immigrants, including from the Indian sub-continent. It has been generally considered
as the most recovered city from the rust belt. [ 97 ] Year City Population City Rank

2013 being named the 3rd "most secure" big city by Farmers Insurance. [ 218 ] Among
crime rates of the 60 largest U. S. cities , 43 had more instances of property crime
while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were
reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against

In Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national
average. [ 222 ] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates
homicide rates. [ 222 ] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement
in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim. [ 223 ]
This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.
[ 223 ] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh
City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million. [ 224 ] About
6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund
goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of
Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures
supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh. [ 225 ] Some people do not believe these
efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard,
rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They
rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories "police budget cost per
person, " "fines / forefeitures, " "Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),
" "Force Used per Arrest, " "Racial Disparities in Deadly Force, " "Excessive Force
Complaints Upheld, " "Discrimination Complaints Upheld, " "Criminal Misconduct Complaints
Upheld, " "Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses, " and "Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.

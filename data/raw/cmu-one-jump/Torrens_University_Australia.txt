Torrens University is an Australian international private, for-profit university and vocational registered training organisation, with campuses in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Blue Mountains, and Auckland, New Zealand. 

Torrens University Australia, along with Think Education and Media Design School, together form Torrens Global Education, which is part of Strategic Education, Inc.

An application from Laureate Education Asia to found a private university was approved by the Government of South Australia in October 2011.[7]  Upon commission, Torrens University became the 33rd university in Australia and the first new university for 20 years.[8]

The go-ahead for the new university was given by the South Australian Cabinet following Premier Mike Rann's negotiations in Australia and in Cancun, Mexico, with Laureate chairman Douglas Becker and Chancellor Michael Mann. Honorary Laureate Chancellor and former US President Bill Clinton publicly endorsed the Australian project.[9]

The founding President and Vice-chancellor was Fred McDougall, former deputy vice-chancellor and vice-president of the University of Adelaide.[10]

Torrens University Australia was accredited by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency in 2012. It was originally expected to open in 2013 but commenced teaching in 2014. In September 2019, Torrens University was reaccredited by TEQSA for 5 years until September 2024.  

In 2020 Strategic Education, Inc. became the new owner of Torrens University Australia. This new alliance created a global network of over 100,000 learners around the world.[11]

As of 2021[update], Torrens University has campuses in and around five cities in Australia and one in New Zealand.[12]

Adelaide was the first location in the country, opening its first campus in the heritage-listed Torrens Building on Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga, in the CBD, in 2013.[13][14]

On 3 August 2015, the university opened a new campus just along the road in the old Menz Biscuits factory on Wakefield Street,[15] and as of 2019[update] no longer lists Torrens Building as another campus.[12] There was another campus in Adelaide on Pulteney Street. This campus was the Blue Mountains International Hotel Management School hub in the centre of Adelaide's CBD, exclusively focused on students studying a Master of International Hotel Management. This campus closed in 2025 and all Adelaide students are now studying at the Wakefield St campus.[16]

The Fortitude Valley campus is adjacent to the Story Bridge and home to a range of courses and degrees in Design and Creative Technology, Health & Education, and Business & Hospitality, along with the Torrens University Language Centre.[12]

Melbourne plays host to a campus located on Melbourne's Flinders Street. The Practice Wellbeing Centre, once based in Fitzroy,,[17] moved in to the Flinders St campus in 2025.[18]

There are two campuses in the Sydney region. These campuses include the Surry Hills and the Blue Mountains campus on the outskirts of metropolitan Sydney.[12][19] The Blue Mountains campus is located in the suburb of Leura,[20] adjacent to Katoomba. The campus is home to Torrens University's Practical Learning Centre,[19] simulated hotel environment where students learn hotel management as part of their practical development. The Ultimo campus has merged with Surry Hills Campus, bringing the home for Design & Creative Technology students to Surry Hills. The Surry Hills Campus continues to be home to students from all other faculties, as well as the Torrens University Language Centre, located just minutes away from Sydney's Central Train Station.[21]

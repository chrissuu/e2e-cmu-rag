The University of Canberra (UC) is a public research university with its main campus located in Bruce, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. The campus is 2.5 km (1.6 mi) from Belconnen Town Centre, and 8.7 km (5.4 mi) from Canberra's Civic Centre. UC offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses through five faculties: Arts and Design; Business, Government and Law; Education; Health; and Science and Technology.

The University of Canberra was first established in 1967 as the Canberra College of Advanced Education. It then became the University of Canberra under sponsorship of Monash University in 1990. 

The foundation stone was unveiled by Prime Minister John Gorton on 28 October 1968. The stone is displayed near Building 1 on the Bruce campus. The inscription reads:

This Stone was unveiled by the right honourable J.G. Gorton, M.P., Prime Minister of Australia, on 28 October 1968, to mark the establishment of the Canberra College of Advanced Education.

An annual celebration, called Stone Day, was first held in 1971. It has since evolved into a popular music festival. Stone Day traditionally took place after classes finished at the end of Semester 2, but before exams. The day before was known as Stone Eve. Stone Day involved a music festival with local bands. 

Over the years, the Stone Day program grew larger, expanding to a whole week in 1976, and became Stoneweek. In the 1980s and 1990s, Stoneweek was a popular Canberra entertainment event and one of Australia's most popular music festivals.[12] In 2000, the festival became Stonefest.

Beginning in 2012, Stonefest was not held for a number of years at the University of Canberra. In 2014, UC created a mini-music Stonefest festival with a DJ and numerous activities, however it was not received well. In 2019, Stonefest returned, with both local and international acts, but did not run in 2020–2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, returning in 2022.

The university's main campus is located in the suburb of Bruce and covers 296 acres (1.2 km2) of buildings, ovals, gardens, lawns, car parks, roads, walkways, and sculptures. The campus is notable for its native gardens and the presence of kangaroos. There are over 29 buildings dedicated to teaching, research, and administration for the disciplines, faculties and business units. These buildings are concentrated around the main concourse. Each building is numbered and many do not hold any title or namesake.[13] At the northern end of the campus is the University of Canberra Hospital which focuses on rehabilitation.[14]

The Refectory is located in Building 1, operated by UCX (the student union).[15] It provides a food court, general shop, pool tables, and lounges, and is also a concert venue. Upstairs there are study rooms which can be booked by students and staff.

The Hub is located under the main concourse, providing a café, hairdressing salon, tattoo parlour, 87.8 UCFM student radio station studio, and social enterprise hub. A bar, convenience store, and several eateries are also available near the student residences.

A sport and fitness centre is located in Building 29 with gym facilities and is home to Brumbies Rugby administration. There are basketball and squash courts nearby in Building 4, and various sporting ovals.[16]

The university has satellite campuses in the following locations[1]:

The governing body of the University of Canberra is its University Council.[17] The current chancellor is Lisa Paul, AO PSM, a former senior Australian public servant and policymaker who was a long-serving Secretary of the Department of Education and Training.[18]

Professor Stephen Parker is the interim vice-chancellor (VC),[19] having previously served as VC 2007–2016. Parker took over from Professor Lucy Johnston who was the interim VC following the sudden departure of Professor Paddy Nixon who served as VC from 6 April 2020 to 15 December 2023.[20][21][22][23] The incoming VC, from February 2025, is Bill Shorten.[24] Prior to Professor Nixon, Professor Deep Saini was VC from 1 September 2016 to 21 December 2019.[25]

Like most Australian universities, University of Canberra derives the majority of its revenue from the Australian Government through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, student fees, research grants and contracts, commercial activities, and donations. The ACT Government provides around one percent of the university's operating budget.[26]

The University's budget in 2022 was A$312.84 million (2022).[27] In 2024, the University of Canberra is expecting a $36 million deficit which triggered emergency spending constraints.[28][29] The deficit is partly attributed to a decline in international student enrolments.[28] The financial situation lead to the announcement in October 2024 of urgent and significant cost-saving measures, including an estimated 200 job cuts by the middle of 2025.[30]

The university has several research centres relating to its areas of research strength. These are:

The University of Canberra Library is located in Building 8. The building has four floors.[33]

The Australian Government's QILT[b] conducts national surveys documenting the student life cycle from enrolment through to employment.[52] These surveys place more emphasis on criteria such as student experience, graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction[52] than perceived reputation, research output and citation counts.[53]

In the 2023 Employer Satisfaction Survey, graduates of the university had an overall employer satisfaction rate of 78.3%.[54]

In the 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey, graduates of the university had a full-time employment rate of 85.3% for undergraduates and 92.9% for postgraduates.[55] The initial full-time salary was A$71,000 for undergraduates and A$84,600 for postgraduates.[55]

In the 2023 Student Experience Survey, undergraduates at the university rated the quality of their entire educational experience at 72.7% meanwhile postgraduates rated their overall education experience at 74.5%.[56]

UC partners with two local ACT schools: UC Senior Secondary College Lake Ginninderra and University of Canberra High School Kaleen. The University of Canberra College provides pathways into university for domestic and international students.[57] UC also shares a memorandum of understanding with the Canberra Institute of Technology which facilitates student educational pathways between the institutions and sharing of some specialist facilities.

Over 100,000 students have graduated from the university since 1970.[58]

After a rapid period of growth which saw a 78% increase in student enrolments between 2007 and 2014,[59][60] UC has sustained an annual enrolment of between 11,000 and 12,000 equivalent full-time students.[58] The median Australian Tertiary Admission Rank of UC students was approximately 71 in 2012.[61]

An independent radio station, 87.8 UCFM is run by students from the main UC campus.

The University has several sporting partnerships including sponsoring the University of Canberra Capitals, a professional women's basketball team, the ACT Brumbies, a professional rugby union team,
and the University of Canberra Firebirds, an amateur American football club.

On Saturday 17 June 2023, UC announced a one million dollar sponsorship of, and partnership with, Stromlo Forest Park that will expand its research and teaching activities across a range of sports, tourism, and business opportunities.[62]

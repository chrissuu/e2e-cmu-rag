The University of Michigan (UMich, U-M, or Michigan) is a public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1817, it is the oldest institution of higher education in the state. The University of Michigan is one of the earliest American research universities and is a founding member of the Association of American Universities.

The university has the largest student population in Michigan, enrolling more than 52,000 students, including more than 30,000 undergraduates and 18,000 postgraduates. UMich is classified as an "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity" by the Carnegie Classification.[12] It consists of 19 schools and colleges, offering more than 280 degree programs.[13][14] The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. In 2021, it ranked third among American universities in research expenditures according to the National Science Foundation.

The campus, comparable in scale to a midsize city, spans 3,177 acres (12.86 km2). It encompasses Michigan Stadium, which is the largest stadium in the United States, as well as the Western Hemisphere, and ranks third globally. The University of Michigan's athletic teams, including 13 men's teams and 14 women's teams competing in intercollegiate sports, are collectively known as the Wolverines. They compete in NCAA Division I (FBS) as a member of the Big Ten Conference. Between 1900 and 2022, athletes from the university earned a total of 185 medals at the Olympic Games, including 86 gold.[15]

The University of Michigan traces its origins to August 26, 1817,[16][17] when it was established in the Territory of Michigan as the Catholepistemiad or University of Michigania through a legislative act signed by acting governor and secretary William Woodbridge, presiding judge Augustus B. Woodward of the Territorial Supreme Court, and judge John Griffin.[18] In 1821, by a new enactment, the university itself was created as a "body politic and corporate",[19] maintaining its corporate status through various modifications to its charter.[20] The term "Catholepistemiad," a neologism derived from a blend of Greek and Latin roots, can be loosely translated as "School of Universal Knowledge".[21] This corporation was modeled after the Imperial University of France, an entity established by Napoleon I a decade prior,[22][23] and included an array of schools and libraries under a single administration,[24] with the authority to establish additional schools across the territory.[23] It wasn't until Michigan became a state in 1837 that the corporation focused solely on higher education.[22]

Promptly after the Territory of Michigan's formation in 1805, prominent citizens acknowledged the need for a college.[25] In 1806, Gabriel Richard, who presided over several schools in the Town of Detroit, first petitioned for land to found a college.[26][27] Although Governor William Hull and Woodward promulgated an act in 1809 to establish public school districts, this preliminary endeavor yielded negligible results.[28] Woodward, aspiring to categorize knowledge (which he termed "encathol epistemia"), discussed this with Thomas Jefferson in 1814.[29] In 1817, Woodward drafted a territorial act for the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, which included thirteen professorships, or didaxiim.[30] The act was enacted on August 26, 1817, with Richard appointed vice president and John Monteith as president. Woodward sought funding from the Zion Masonic Lodge, which contributed $250, leading to a total of $5,000 raised for the university.[31][32] The cornerstone for the first schoolhouse, situated near the intersection of Bates Street and Congress Street in Detroit, was laid on September 24, 1817, and by the following year, a Lancasterian school, taught by Lemuel Shattuck, and a classical academy were operational.[33] Additional schools were established in Monroe and Mackinaw by the end of September 1817.[20] In 1821, a new act placed the corporation under the control of a board of trustees.[34] Monteith, no longer president, joined the board, and Richard served on the board until his death in 1832.[35] The trustees continued to manage the schools and classical academy, but established no new schools.[36] By 1827, all schools had closed, and the Detroit schoolhouse was leased to private teachers.[36]

In 1837, following Michigan's admission to the Union, its constitution enabled the appointive regents to oversee university operations directly alongside professors, without the need for a president.[22] The regents met in Ann Arbor and accepted the town's proposal for the university to relocate,[37][38] based on a 40 acres (16 ha) grant from the Treaty of Fort Meigs[39][40] on Henry Rumsey's farmland.[41] Alexander Jackson Davis devised the original campus plan in Gothic Revival style,[42] and the regents unanimously approved his proposal;[43] however, the plan was abandoned due to financial constraints resulting from the Panic of 1837.[44][45] In 1841, Mason Hall, the first campus building, was completed, followed by the construction of South College, an identical building to the south, in 1849, leaving a gap for a future grand centerpiece.[43]

Asa Gray was appointed the first professor following the university's move to Ann Arbor in 1837,[47][48][49][50][51] alongside early faculty members Douglass Houghton and Andrew Ten Brook.[51][52] The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore taught by two professors, Joseph Whiting and George Palmer Williams.[53][54] In the first commencement of 1845, eleven graduates, including Judson Dwight Collins, were awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree.[55] In subsequent years, the regents established branches across the state as preparatory schools for the university,[56] starting with Pontiac and followed by Kalamazoo, Detroit, Niles, Tecumseh, White Pigeon, and Romeo.[56] However, they struggled to enroll students and some merged with local colleges.[56] Kalamazoo College was the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan from 1840 to 1850.[56] Furthermore, the university struggled with issues due to its regents' dependence on the legislature from 1837 to 1850.[57][58] Despite several attempts to gain independence, progress was slow until the late 1840s, when regents gained leverage, supported by Michigan citizens.[57] This led to a revision of the organic act on April 8, 1851, which freed the university from legislative control, changed the regent position from appointed to elected, and established a president selected by the regents.[57]

Henry Philip Tappan became the university's first president in 1852, with the ambition to shape the institution as a model for future universities. During his decade of service, he overhauled the curriculum,[59] expanded the library and museum collections,[59] established the law school,[22] and supervised the construction of the Detroit Observatory.[59] He secularized faculty appointments by prioritizing merit in selections,[59] breaking away from the retrograde tradition of regents distributing positions among Protestant denominations.[59] In 1855, Michigan became the second university in the country to issue Bachelor of Science degrees.[60] The following year, the country's first chemical laboratory was built on campus, specifically designed for chemistry education, providing additional space for classes and laboratories.[61] Tappan's tenure also saw the creation of the Michigan Glee Club, the oldest student organization at the university, and the publication of the first student newspaper, The Peninsular Phoenix and Gazetteer, in 1857.[62] Despite these accomplishments, Tappan's 11-year presidency was marked by considerable tension.[59] His impartial stance on religion faced backlash during a time of heightened religious fervor.[59] Due to changes in the Board of Regents and discontent with his administration, he was forced to resign in 1863.[59]

In 1863, Erastus Otis Haven took office as president, having been a professor at the time and needing to prove his right for the presidency.[63] The campus was divided by conflicting views among students, faculty, and regents regarding Tappan's restoration, the homeopathy crisis, and the Civil War.[63] Haven's administration faced routine administrative difficulties and struggled to garner support for increased state aid, despite achieving modest gains.[63] The university, which had received a fixed $15,000 since 1869, still required additional funding.[63] Frustrated, Haven resigned in 1869 to become president of Northwestern, a Methodist institution, a move that sectarians viewed as a setback for secular colleges.[63] The presidency remained vacant from 1869 to 1871, with Professor Henry Simmons Frieze serving as acting president.[64] During this period, the university raised funds for University Hall, overhauled admissions with a diploma system, and introduced coeducation.[64] Women were first admitted in 1870,[65] although Alice Robinson Boise Wood was the first woman to attend classes in 1866.[66] In 1870, Gabriel Franklin Hargo graduated from the law school as the second African American to graduate from a law school in the United States.[67] In 1871, Sarah Killgore became the first woman to graduate from law school and be admitted to the bar of any state in the United States.[68] Frieze, a champion of music education, also established the University Musical Society.[64] By the late 1860s, the university had become one of the largest in the nation, alongside Harvard in Cambridge.[69] However, it faced ongoing issues with student discipline, including class rushes, instances of hazing, and rowdiness in chapel.[70][64] Frieze attributed these problems to a lack of centralized faculty control.[64]

James Burrill Angell became president in 1871 and would remain in the post for nearly four decades.[71] His tenure would be remembered as the most successful in the university's history.[71] Tappan's reforms in the 1850s set the university on a path to becoming an elite institution, but it was Angell who completed that transformation.[71] Shortly after Angell's arrival, University Hall was completed at vast expense; it would remain the university's major academic building right up until the 1950s.[71] During his presidency, Angell restored campus discipline,[70][71] raised entrance and graduation requirements,[71] and persuaded the legislature to increase state aid.[71] Angell's tenure saw the addition of many extracurricular activities, including the intercollegiate football team.[71] Though a reformer, Angell was not authoritarian; he encouraged open debate and aimed for near-unanimous agreement before implementing changes, rather than pushing through with only a narrow majority.[71] This approach enabled him to address knotty issues on campus, including the long-standing homeopathy problem.[71] Angell transformed the curriculum to focus on electives, expanding course offerings.[70] That led to a faculty of great minds in many fields, from John Dewey in philosophy to Frederick George Novy in bacteriology.[72] In 1875, the university founded the College of Dental Surgery, followed by the establishment of the College of Pharmacy by Albert B. Prescott in 1876. That year, the university awarded its first Doctor of Philosophy degrees: to Victor C. Vaughan in chemistry and William E. Smith in zoology.[73][25] They were among the first doctoral degrees to be conferred in the nation.[73] The university remained the only institution in the state to grant PhD degrees until the late 1940s.[74]

"Stand up for America; devote your life to its cause; love your homes, and prove as worthy of our cherished free institutions as they are worthy of your allegiance and service. Let not the high standard of National Honor, raised by the fathers, be lowered by their sons. Let learning, liberty and law be exalted and enthroned."

With his presidency, Angell focused the university on preparing a new generation of statesmen for public service.[71] Angell himself was frequently called upon by the White House for diplomatic missions.[71] In 1880, President Rutherford Hayes appointed him as Minister to China, where he successfully negotiated an immigration treaty that facilitated foreign student enrollment.[71] Later, in 1887, 1896, and 1897, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to fisheries and waterways commissions.[71] That same year, President William McKinley named him Envoy Extraordinary to Turkey.[71] By the late 19th century, the university had gained an international reputation, in large part due to Angell's diplomatic efforts.[71] During this period, over eighty subjects of the Emperor of Japan were sent to Ann Arbor to study law as part of the opening of that empire to external influence.[76] The university also played a key role in developing the Philippine education, legal, and public health systems during American colonization, largely due to the contributions of Michigan alumni like Dean Conant Worcester and George A. Malcolm.[77] Angell retired in 1909, and seven years later, he died in the President's House, which had been his home for forty-five years.[71] His successor, Harry Burns Hutchins, who was once his student, would lead the university through World War I and the Great Influenza epidemic.[71]

In 1910, Harry Burns Hutchins assumed the presidency, becoming the first alumnus to hold that position.[78] He had spent seven years in Ithaca, New York, where he was called by Andrew Dickson White and Charles Kendall Adams to establish the Cornell Law School.[78] Hutchins then became the dean of the law school at his alma mater, where he introduced the case method of instruction.[78] Hutchins was acting president when Angell was absent.[78] During his presidency, Hutchins established the Graduate School,[78] doubled enrollment,[78] and increased the faculty.[78] He secured more state aid and alumni support to fund the university's capital needs,[78] including the gothic Law Quadrangle,[79] Martha Cook Building,[80] Hill Auditorium, and Michigan Union, which became campus landmarks. Hutchins enhanced the university health service,[78] but wartime distractions plagued his presidency. The influenza epidemic, which caused student deaths from poor care, deeply troubled him.[78] Well-liked by the regents who encouraged him to remain president, nonetheless, Hutchins retired in 1920.[78]

The 1920s at the university were marked by the brief tenures of two presidents, Marion LeRoy Burton and Clarence Cook Little.[81] In 1920, when Burton assumed office, a conference on higher education took place at the university, resulting in the establishment of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges.[82] Under his leadership, construction boomed on campus,[82] and enrollments increased,[82] propelled by the prosperous economy of the Roaring Twenties. He initiated the annual honors convocation,[82] introduced the deans' conference,[82] and increased university income.[82] The proposal for establishing a nonsectarian divinity school on campus came after strong advocacy from Charles Foster Kent and received unanimous backing from nearby churches.[83] The school was short-lived and was quietly shelved in 1927.[83] Burton fell ill in 1924 and died in 1925.[82] In this emergency, President Emeritus Hutchins was called by the regents to assist, with Alfred Henry Lloyd serving as acting president until Little's arrival.[82] Clarence Cook Little was elected president in 1925,[84] advocating for individualized education[84] and reforming curricula, particularly for women.[84] Little proposed a curriculum division after two years to address knowledge gaps, leading to the University College proposal, which was ultimately abandoned after his resignation in 1929.[84]

Following Little's resignation, Alexander Grant Ruthven, an alumnus, was elected president by unanimous vote.[85] He would lead the university through the Great Depression and World War II.[85] Under Ruthven's leadership, the university administration became more decentralized with the creation of the university council, various divisions, and a system of committees.[85] For years, the university was a backwater in theoretical physics. Nonetheless, this changed under department head Harrison McAllister Randall, who brought theorists Samuel Goudsmit, George Uhlenbeck, and Otto Laporte onto the faculty.[86] Goudsmit mentored famous students at the university, including Robert Bacher and Wu Ta-You, the Father of Chinese Physics, who in turn taught Zhu Guangya and two Nobel laureates, Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee. From 1928 to 1941, the Summer Symposium in Theoretical Physics featured renowned physicists like Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac, and Erwin Schrödinger, with at least fifteen attendees being Nobel laureates or future laureates.[87] Wolfgang Pauli held a visiting professorship at the university in 1931.[88] Stephen Timoshenko created the first U.S. bachelor's and doctoral programs in engineering mechanics when he was a faculty professor at the university. In 1948, shortly after World War II, the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project was established to honor the hundreds of lives lost from the university during the war.[89][22] Funded by numerous contributors, including the Ford Motor Company, the Phoenix Project operated the Ford Nuclear Reactor, which established the nation's first academic program in nuclear science and engineering.[90]

For most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Michigan stood as the sole university within the state, and its alumni often dominated state politics. However, by the mid-20th century, the landscape began to shift as new universities emerged, many of which were former technical schools, thereby threatening that status quo.[91] When Harlan Hatcher took office as president in 1951, he was entrusted with securing the university's preeminence among the nation and world's burgeoning research institutions. This marked the beginning of a phase of post-war development, during which Hatcher oversaw the construction of North Campus, the founding of Flint Senior College, and the establishment of the Dearborn Center, both of which have since evolved into full-fledged branch campuses.[92][93] Nonetheless, the tenures of Hatcher and his successor, Robben Wright Fleming, were marked by a sharp rise in campus activism, linked to the Civil Rights Movement and the anti-Vietnam War movement.[92] In 1963, a controversial set of admissions practices collectively known as 'affirmative action' was introduced.[94] It was a radical measure originated by Hobart Taylor Jr., aimed at boosting Black student enrollment at elite universities.[94] Meanwhile, in 1964, a group of faculty hosted the nation's first "teach-in" against U.S. foreign policy in Southeast Asia, attended by thousands of students.[95][96] Subsequent sit-ins by campus groups prompted administrative crackdowns, leading to more unrest across the campus.[92] Meanwhile, Hatcher controversially dismissed three professors for their refusal to cooperate with Joseph McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee during his tenure.[97] Hatcher's successor, Robben Wright Fleming guided the university through a turbulent era of activism.[92] In 1969, a year into Fleming's tenure, a Marxist militant organization known as the Weather Underground was founded on campus.[98] This group, led by members of the Jesse James Gang, an offshoot of the Students for a Democratic Society, employed militant tactics, including taking hostages.[92] A year later, a strike organized by the Black Action Movement, another radical group, resulted in the university agreeing to several demands for minority support.[99] In 1971, the Spectrum Center was founded as the nation's oldest collegiate LGBT student center.[100] Meanwhile, support among students for marijuana legalization was gaining traction on campus, as evidenced by the annual Hash Bash rally that began in 1972.[101] Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, campus unrest began to diminish the university's academic standing, which had been ranked among the top five in the nation.[91] That standing started to decline during Fleming's tenure. Campus unrest persisted during Harold Tafler Shapiro's presidency, which began in 1980, fueled by controversies surrounding the university's national defense initiatives and foreign investments.

President James Duderstadt would succeed Shapiro and remain president until 1996.[102] He supported campus growth and fundraising initiatives. Duderstadt's successor, Lee Bollinger, conducted several major construction projects like the School of Social Work building[103] and the Tisch Hall, named in honor of alumnus Preston Robert Tisch.[104] In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court heard two cases regarding the university's affirmative action admissions: Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger. In 2002, the university elected its first female president, Mary Sue Coleman, by unanimous vote.[105][106] Throughout her presidency, Michigan's endowment saw continued growth, accompanied by a major fundraising drive known as "The Michigan Difference".[107] The Coleman's administration faced labor disputes with the university's labor unions, notably with the Lecturers' Employees Organization and the Graduate Employees Organization.[108] In the early 2000s, the university faced declining state funding, prompting suggestions for privatization.[109][110] Despite being a state institution de jure, it adopted private funding models.[111] A 2008 legislative panel further recommended converting it to a private institution due to its minimal ties to the state.[112] Mark Schlissel succeeded Coleman in 2014. Before his firing in 2022, Schlissel expanded financial aid offerings,[113] enhanced international engagement,[114] and raised student diversity.[115] He also led initiatives in biosciences[116] and the arts.[117] Schlissel's successor, Santa Ono, would serve a short and lackluster tenure amid the national pro-Palestinian protests[118][119][120][121][122][123][124][125][126] before his immediate resignation.[127] The presidency has remained vacant since then, with Domenico Grasso serving as the interim president.[128]

The founding of the University of Michigan in the 19th century was influenced by the transatlantic Republic of Letters, an intellectual community that spanned Europe and the Americas.[59] Key figures, such as Henry Philip Tappan, were instrumental in aligning the university with the ideals championed by the intellectual community, including liberty, reason, and scientific inquiry.[59] Alumni and faculty from Michigan, like Andrew Dixon White, carried these ideals forward as they shaped other institutions.[129][130] Notably, Cornell alumni David Starr Jordan and John Casper Branner later introduced these concepts to Stanford University in the late 19th century.[129] Early university leaders like James Burrill Angell contributed to establishing other universities by sharing their insights.[71] Alongside Charles William Eliot of Harvard, Andrew D. White of Cornell, and Noah Porter of Yale, Angell was heavily involved in the early period of Johns Hopkins University as an advisor to the trustees and recommended Daniel Coit Gilman as the first president of the wealthy new foundation.[131] Clark Kerr, the first chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, referred to Michigan as the "mother of state universities."[91]

The University of Michigan's campus in Ann Arbor is divided into four main areas: the Central Campus area, the North Campus area, the North Medical Campus area, and Ross Athletic Campus area. The campus areas include more than 500 major buildings,[138] with a combined area of more than 37.48 million square feet (860 acres; 3.482 km2).[139] The Central and Athletic Campus areas are contiguous, while the North Campus area is separated from them, primarily by the Huron River.[140] The North Medical Campus area was developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery.[141]

All four campus areas are connected by bus services, the majority of which connect the North and Central campus areas. There is a shuttle service connecting the University Hospital, which lies between North and Central campus areas, with other medical facilities throughout northeastern Ann Arbor.[142]

There is leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System. In addition to the University of Michigan Golf Course on Ross Athletic Campus, the university operates a second golf course on Geddes Road called Radrick Farms Golf Course.[143] The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor. The Inglis House is an off-campus facility, which the university has owned since the 1950s. The Inglis House is a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2) mansion used to hold various social events, including meetings of the Board of Regents, and to host visiting dignitaries.[144] Another major off-campus facility is the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, which is located on the eastern outskirts of the City of Ann Arbor.[145]

The original Central Campus spanned 40 acres (16 ha), bordered by North University Avenue, South University Avenue, East University Avenue, and State Street. The master plan was developed by Alexander Jackson Davis. The first structures built included four Greek Revival faculty residences in 1840,[146][147][148][149] as well as Mason Hall (1841–1950)[150] and South College (1849–1950),[151] which functioned as both academic spaces and dormitories. Only one of the original faculty residences remains today; it has been renovated in the Italianate style to serve as the President's House,[149] making it the oldest building on campus.[40] The Chemical Laboratory,[152] built by Albert Jordan in 1856 and operational until 1980, was notable for housing the nation's first instructional chemistry lab. After the completion of the Old Medical Building (1850–1914)[153] and the Law Building (1863–1950),[154] an open space known as The Diag began to take shape. Among the notable structures on the original Central Campus were University Hall (1872–1950),[155] designed by alumnus E. S. Jennison,[156] and the Old Library (1881–1918),[157] designed by Henry Van Brunt, who was also the architect behind Memorial Hall (1870) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The Central Campus today, however, bears little resemblance to its 19th-century appearance, as most of its original structures were demolished and rebuilt in the early 20th century.[158][159] The rebuilt structures are primarily the work of Albert Kahn, who served as the university's supervising architect during that period.[160] In 1909, Regent William L. Clements became chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee, leading to Albert Kahn's growing influence in the university's architectural development. Clements, impressed by Kahn's work on his industrial projects and residence in Bay City, awarded him multiple university commissions and appointed him as the university's supervising architect. The West Engineering Hall (1910), Natural Science Building (1915), and General Library (1920) were all designed by Kahn. During a period of limited construction funding, these structures exhibited a simple design with minimal ornamentation. However, Kahn's Hill Auditorium (1913), adequately funded by Regent Arthur Hill, features extensive Sullivanesque ornamentation and excellent acoustic design, which was rare for that period.[156]

Beginning in 1920, the university received greater funding for construction projects, thanks to president Burton's fiscal persuasiveness with the legislature, propelled by a prosperous economy. This allowed campus buildings to be constructed in a grand manner. Kahn's Italian Renaissance Clements Library (1923), Classical Greek Angell Hall (1924), and Art Deco Burton Memorial Tower (1936) all feature unusual and costly materials and are considered some of his most elegant university buildings. The last of Kahn's university commissions was the Ruthven Museums Building (1928), designed in the Renaissance style.[156]

Other architects who contributed to the Central Campus include Spier & Rohns, who designed Tappan Hall (1894) and the West Medical Building (1904); Smith, Hinchman and Grylls, the architects of the Chemistry Building (1910) and East Engineering Building; and Perkins, Fellows and Hamilton, who designed University High School (1924). The Michigan Union (1919) and Michigan League (1929), completed by alumni Irving Kane Pond and Allen Bartlit Pond, house the university's various student organizations. Alumni Memorial Hall, funded by contributions from alumni in memory of the university's Civil War dead, was completed by Donaldson and Meier. It was designated as the University Museum of Art in 1946.[156]

The area just south of The Diag is predominantly Gothic in character, contrasting with the classical designs prevalent in many of Kahn's university buildings. The Martha Cook Building (1915), completed by York and Sawyer, Samuel Parsons, and George A. Fuller in 1915, draws inspiration from England's Knole House and Aston Hall. It was one of the university’s early women’s residences. York and Sawyer also designed the Law Quadrangle, which features a flagstone courtyard by landscape architect Jacob Van Heiningan. The Lawyers' Club, part of the quadrangle, includes a clubhouse, dining hall, and dormitory, modeled after English clubs with an Elizabethan-style lounge and a dining hall inspired by the chapels of Eaton. The Law Library's main reading room showcases craftsmanship from the Rockefeller Church of New York. Following its completion, nearby buildings like the School of Education Building, by Malcomson and Higginbotham, and Emil Lorch's Architecture and Design Building adopted Gothic elements reflecting the style of the Law Quadrangle and Martha Cook Residence.[156]

The Central Campus is the location of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. Most of the graduate and professional schools, including the Law School, Ross School of Business, Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and the School of Dentistry, are on Central Campus. Two main libraries, Hatcher Graduate Library and Shapiro Undergraduate Library, as well as the university's many museums, are also on Central Campus.[161]

The North Campus area built independently from the city on a large plot of farmland—approximately 800 acres (3.2 km2)—that the university bought in 1952.[162] Architect Eero Saarinen devised the early master plan for the North Campus area and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building.[163] The North Campus Diag features a bell tower called Lurie Tower, which contains a grand carillon.[164] The university's largest residence hall, Bursley Hall, is in the North Campus area.[159]

The North Campus houses the College of Engineering, the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, the Stamps School of Art & Design, the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, and an annex of the School of Information.[165] The campus area is served by Duderstadt Center, which houses the Art, Architecture and Engineering Library. Duderstadt Center also contains multiple computer labs, video editing studios, electronic music studios, an audio studio, a video studio, multimedia workspaces, and a 3D virtual reality room.[166] Other libraries located on North Campus include the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and the Bentley Historical Library.

Ross Athletic Campus is the site for the university's athletic programs, including major sports facilities such as Michigan Stadium, Crisler Center, and Yost Ice Arena. The campus area is also the site of the Buhr library storage facility, Revelli Hall, home of the Michigan Marching Band, the Institute for Continuing Legal Education,[167] and the Student Theatre Arts Complex, which provides shop and rehearsal space for student theatre groups.[168] The university's departments of public safety and transportation services offices are located on Ross Athletic Campus.[167]

The University of Michigan Golf Course is located south of Michigan Stadium. It was designed in the late 1920s by Alister MacKenzie, the designer of Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, home of the Masters Tournament.[169] The course opened to the public in 1931 and has one of "the best holes ever designed by Augusta National architect Alister MacKenzie" according to the magazine Sports Illustrated in 2006.[170]

The University of Michigan is governed by the Board of Regents, established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837. It consists of eight members, elected at large in biennial state elections for overlapping eight-year terms.[171][172][173] Before the Office of President was established in 1850, the University of Michigan was directly managed by the appointed regents, with a rotating group of professors responsible for carrying out day-to-day administrative duties.[174] The Constitution of the State of Michigan of 1850 restructured the university's administration. It established the Office of the President and transitioned the Board of Regents to an elected body. The state constitution granted the Board of Regents the power to appoint a non-voting presiding president to lead their meetings,[175] effectively elevating the board to the level of a constitutional corporation independent of the state administration and making the University of Michigan the first public institution of higher education in the country so organized. As of 2021–22, the Board of Regents is chaired by Jordan B. Acker (B.A. '06).

The Board of Regents delegates its power to the university president who serves as the chief executive officer responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the university, that is, the main campus in Ann Arbor. The president retains authority over the branch campuses in Dearborn and Flint but is not directly involved in their day-to-day management. Instead, two separate chancellors are appointed by the president to serve as chief executive officers overseeing each branch campus. All presidents are appointed by the Board of Regents to serve five-year terms, at the board's discretion, and there are no term limits for university presidents. The board has the authority to either terminate the president's tenure or extend it for an additional term.

The presidency of the University of Michigan is currently vacant, with Domenico Grasso (PhD ‘87) serving as the interim president.[176] Following the immediate resignation of Santa Ono,[177][178][179][180] the university's former president, the board of regents named Grasso as the university’s interim president on May 8, 2025.[176] He will lead the university during the search for the next president.[176] Laurie McCauley has been serving as the 17th and current provost of the university since May 2022, and she was recommended by former president Santa Ono to serve a full term through June 30, 2027.[181]

The President's House, located at 815 South University Avenue on the Ann Arbor campus, is the official residence and office of the University President. Constructed in 1840, the three-story Italianate President's House is the oldest surviving building on the Ann Arbor campus and a University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District contributing property.[182]

The Central Student Government, housed in the Michigan Union, is the university's student government. As a 501(c)(3) independent organization, it represents students from all colleges and schools, manages student funds on campus, and has representatives from each academic unit. The Central Student Government is separate from the University of Michigan administration.[183]

Over the years, the Central Student Government has led voter registration drives,[184] revived Homecoming events,[185] changed a football seating policy,[186] and created a Student Advisory Council for Ann Arbor city affairs.[187] A longstanding goal of the Central Student Government has been to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents.[188] In 2000 and 2002, students Nick Waun, Scott Trudeau, Matt Petering, and Susan Fawcett ran for the Board of Regents on the statewide ballot as third-party nominees, though none were successful.[189] A 1998 poll by the State of Michigan concluded that a majority of voters would approve adding a student regent position if put to a vote.[188] However, amending the composition of the Board of Regents would require a constitutional amendment in Michigan.[190]

In addition to the Central Student Government, each college and school at the University of Michigan has its own independent student governance body. Undergraduate students in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts are represented by the LS&A Student Government.[191] Engineering Student Government manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government, and law students are represented by the Law School Student Senate as is each other college with its own respective government. In addition, the students who live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association, which contains the third most constituents after Central Student Government and LS&A Student Government.[192]

In the fiscal year 2022–23, the State of Michigan spent $333 million on the university, which represents 3.03% of its total operating revenues of $11 billion.[193] The university is the second-largest recipient of state appropriations for higher education in Michigan for 2022-23, trailing Michigan State University ($372 million).[194] The Office of Budget and Planning reports that Michigan Medicine's auxiliary activities are the largest funding source, contributing $6.05 billion to the Auxiliary Funds, which accounts for 55.1% of the total operating budget. Student tuition and fees contributed $1.95 billion to the General Fund, accounting for 11% of the total budget.[193] Research grants and contracts from the U.S. federal government contributed $1.15 billion to the Expendable Restricted Funds, accounting for 10.4% of the total budget.[193]

The university's current (FY 2022–23) operating budget has four major sources of funding:[193]

The university's financial endowment, known as the "University Endowment Fund", comprises over 12,400 individual funds.[195] Each fund must be spent according to the donor's specifications.[195] Approximately 28% of the total endowment is allocated to support academic programs, while 22% is designated for student scholarships and fellowships.[195] Approximately 19% of the endowment was allocated to Michigan Medicine and can only be used to support research, patient care, or other purposes specified by donors.[195]

As of 2023[update], the university's endowment, valued at $17.9 billion, ranks as the tenth largest among all universities in the country.[196][197] The university ranks 86th in endowment per student.[196] The law school's endowment, totaling over $500 million, has a significantly higher per-student value compared to that of its parent university.[198] It ranks as the eighth wealthiest law school in the nation in 2022.[198]

There are thirteen undergraduate schools and colleges.[199] By enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the College of Engineering, and the Ross School of Business.[200] At the graduate level, the Rackham School of Graduate Studies serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university.[201] There are 18 graduate schools and colleges. Professional degrees are conferred by the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, the School of Nursing, the School of Dentistry, the Law School, the Medical School, and the College of Pharmacy.[200] Michigan Medicine, the university's health system, comprises the university's three hospitals, dozens of outpatient clinics, and many centers for medical care, research, and education.

U.S. News & World Report rates Michigan "Most Selective",[208] and The Princeton Review rates its admissions selectivity of 96 out of 99.[209] Admissions are characterized as "more selective, lower transfer-in" according to the Carnegie Classification.[210][211] Michigan received over 83,000 applications for a place in the 2021–22 freshman class, making it one of the most applied-to universities in the United States.[211][212] Of those students accepted to Michigan's Class of 2027, 7,050 chose to attend.

Admission is based on academic prowess, extracurricular activities, and personal qualities. The university's admission process is need-blind for domestic applicants.[213] It does not consider legacy preferences.[214] Admissions officials consider a student's standardized test scores, application essay and letters of recommendation to be important academic factors, with emphasis on an applicant's academic record and GPA, while ranking an applicant's high school class rank as 'not considered'.[205][206] In terms of non-academic materials as of 2022, Michigan ranks character/personal qualities and whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant as 'important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking extracurricular activities, talent/ability, geographical residence, state residency, volunteer work, work experience and level of applicant's interest as 'considered'.[205] Some applicants to Music, Theatre and Dance and some applicants to the College of Engineering may be interviewed.[205] A portfolio is required and considered for admission for Art, Architecture and the Ross School of Business.[205] Submission of standardized test scores is recommended but not compulsory.[215] Of the 52% of enrolled freshmen in 2023 who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1350–1530. Of the 18% of the incoming freshman class who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 31 and 34.

Since the fall of 2021, the university has had the largest number of students in the state, surpassing Michigan State University's former enrollment leadership.[216] Given the state's shrinking pool of college-age students, there is public concern that the university's expansion could harm smaller schools by drawing away good students.[217][218] Some of the state's regional public universities and smaller private colleges have already seen significant declines in enrollment, while others face difficulties in maintaining enrollment figures without lowering admission standards.[217]

The university experienced an unexpected surge in student enrollment for the 2023 academic year, having admitted more students than it could support.[219] This over-yield situation has placed considerable strain on student housing affordability, heightened faculty members' workloads, and stretched resources thin.[219] The university is now embracing a steady-state admissions management strategy aimed at maintaining a stable class size.[219]

The Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, the graduate school of the University of Michigan, received a total of 21,554 applications for admission into its doctoral programs for the 2024 admission year, encompassing the Summer and Fall terms.[220]  The school extended offers of admission to 2,586 applicants, representing 12.00% of the applicant pool.[220] Subsequently, 1,102 of the offers were accepted, resulting in a yield rate of 42.61% for the academic year.[220] Applicants may submit multiple applications to different doctoral programs and receive multiple offers, but can only matriculate into one program at a time. Doctoral programs that are not administered by Rackham are not included in the statistics.

The selectivity of admissions to doctoral programs varies considerably among different disciplines, with certain highly competitive fields exhibiting acceptance rates in the single digits. For instance, in 2023, the field of Business Administration admitted only 5.2% of its 519 applicants. Similarly, the field of Sociology had a selectivity rate of 5.01%, selecting from a pool of 439 applicants. The field of Psychology was even more competitive, with a selectivity rate of 4.1% out of 805 applicants. Other traditionally highly competitive fields include Philosophy, Public Policy & Economics, Political Science, and Robotics.[220]

In August 1841, the university first published its admission requirements for incoming freshmen. These criteria placed a strong emphasis on proficiency in ancient languages, particularly Latin and Greek.[228] Prospective students faced an examination process that assessed their knowledge across various subjects, including arithmetic, algebra, English grammar, geography, Latin literature (Virgil and Cicero's Select Orations), Greek literature (Jacob's or Felton's Greek Reader), Latin grammar (Andrews and Stoddard's), and Greek grammar (Sophocles's).[citation needed]

A decade later, the university made a significant change to its admission policy. In 1851, it introduced a more flexible approach by waiving the ancient language requirement for students not pursuing the traditional collegiate course and allowing admission without examination in classical languages for these students.[229] This adjustment can be viewed as a prelude to scientific education, signaling a gradual shift from the classical curriculum to a more diverse and modern academic offering.[citation needed]

In the early days of the university, the admission requirements varied across different departments, and most admissions were based on referrals. However, in 1863, a standardized entrance examination was introduced, establishing a single set of qualifications for admission to all academic and professional departments.[230] The university administration at the time praised the implementation of this entrance examination, recognizing its contribution to enhancing the admission process.[229]

In 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's affirmative action admissions policy reached the U.S. Supreme Court (Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger). U.S. President George W. Bush publicly opposed the policy before the court issued a ruling.[231] The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding, but it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional. In the first case, the court upheld the Law School admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.[232] The debate continued because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed Proposal 2, banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law, race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions.[233] U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the law soon after that referendum. This allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the initiative results. In April 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action that Proposal 2 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.[233]

Among all first-time freshmen students who enrolled at the university in fall 2017, 82.0% graduated within four years (by August 31, 2021); 10.2% graduated in more than four years but in five years or less  (after August 31, 2021, and by August 31, 2022); 1.1% graduated in more than five years but in six years or less (after August 31, 2022, and by August 31, 2023).[204] The percentage of undergraduate students from the fall 2022 cohort returning in fall 2023 was 98.0% for full-time freshman students.[204]

The university offers 133 undergraduate majors & degrees across the College of Engineering (18), College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (77), College of Pharmacy (1), Ford School of Public Policy (1), LSA Residential College (3), Marsal Family School of Education (3), Ross School of Business (1), School of Dentistry (1), School of Information (2), School of Kinesiology (3), School of Music, Theatre & Dance (16), School of Nursing (1), School of Public Health (2), Stamps School of Art & Design (2), and Taubman College of Architecture & Urban Planning (2). The most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021 graduates, were computer and information sciences (874), business administration and management (610), economics (542), behavioral neuroscience (319), mechanical engineering (316), experimental psychology (312).[234]

The Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies offers more than 180 graduate degree programs in collaboration with fourteen other schools and colleges. Nineteen graduate and professional degree programs, including the juris doctor, master of business administration, doctor of dental surgery, master of engineering, doctor of engineering, doctor of medicine, and doctor of pharmacy, are offered exclusively by the schools and colleges; Rackham does not oversee their administration. The university conferred 4,951 graduate degrees, and 709 first professional degrees in 2011–2012.[235][236]

The university is listed among the leading suppliers of undergraduate and graduate alumni to Silicon Valley tech firms.[237] In 2015, the university ranked 6th on the list of top feeder schools for Google, which employed over 500 graduates at the time. The university ranked 10th on the list of top feeder schools for Meta.[238] Google and Meta remain the university's first and second top employers in 2024.[239]

In 2022, Michigan Ross ranked 11th among all business schools in the United States according to Poets & Quants, with its MBA graduates earning an average starting base salary of $165,000 and an average sign-on bonus of $30,000.[240]

The U.S. Department of Education reports that as of June 2024, federally aided students who attended University of Michigan-Ann Arbor had a median annual income of $83,648 (based on 2020-2021 earnings adjusted to 2022 dollars) five years after graduation.[241] This figure exceeds both the midpoint for 4-year schools of $53,617 and the U.S. real median personal income of $40,460 for the year 2021 adjusted to 2022 dollars.[241][242] Federally aided bachelor's graduates from the university's largest program, computer and information science, which had over 950 students in the 2020-21 cohort, had a median annual income of $153,297 five years after graduation.[241]

According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, law tops the list of most valuable first professional degrees offered by the university when ranked by earnings potential in 2022, with its federally aided students earning a median salary of $197,273 five years after graduation.[241] Dentistry ($158,677), pharmacy ($142,224), and medicine ($134,187) follow behind in that order.[241]

The fields of business administration ($140,827), economics ($108,627), mathematics ($107,395), and statistics ($105,494) are among the bachelor's degree programs with the highest earning potential offered by the university.[241] In 2022, the university's federally aided students in these programs were earning median salaries exceeding the $100,000 threshold five years after graduation.[241] Additionally, various engineering disciplines such as computer engineering ($123,120), aerospace, aeronautical, and astronautical engineering ($113,025), industrial engineering ($109,239), electrical, electronics and communications engineering ($109,107), mechanical engineering ($101,514), chemical engineering ($100,000) are among the top-earning majors.[241] Computer sciences ($153,297) and information science ($125,257) also fall into this high-earning category.[241]

The University of Michigan library system comprises nineteen individual libraries with twenty-four separate collections—roughly 13.3 million volumes as of 2012.[243] The university was the original home of the JSTOR database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics, and has initiated a book digitization program in collaboration with Google.[244] The University of Michigan Press is also a part of the library system.

Several academic journals are published at the university:

The university places an emphasis on research and on attracting influential academics to join its faculty.[254] It is a large, four-year, residential research university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.[210][255][256] The four-year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments and emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate programs. The university has "very high" research activity and the comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees in medicine, law, and dentistry.[210] The university has been included on the list of Public Ivies.[b][263]

Subject-specific rankings

The University of Michigan is one of the twelve founding members of the Association of American Universities, a consortium of the leading research universities in North America. The university manages the fourth-largest research budget of any university in the United States, with total R&D expenditures of $1.925 billion in 2023.[278][279] The federal government was the main source of funding, with grants from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, NASA, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), collectively accounting for over half of the research volume.[280]

The first measurement of the magnetic moment and spin of free electrons and positrons was conducted by H. Richard Crane, an experimental physicist at the university.[281] The university operated the Ford Nuclear Reactor from 1933 to 1955, during which it conducted extensive research related to nuclear energy. It currently hosts several major research centers focusing on optics, reconfigurable manufacturing systems, and wireless integrated microsystems.

A pioneer in computing technology, the university designed and built the Michigan Terminal System, an early time-sharing computer operating system,[282][283][284] and was involved in the development of the NSFnet national backbone, which is regarded as the foundation upon which the global Internet was built.[285][286][287] In 2024, the university began collaborating with Los Alamos National Laboratory on high-performance computing and AI research.[288][289]

The first inactivated flu vaccine was developed by Thomas Francis Jr. and Jonas Salk at Michigan.[290][291][292] This was the first of many advancements at the university related to vaccination, including the development of a live attenuated influenza vaccine by Hunein Maassab.[293] The university also introduced histotripsy, a non-invasive technique that uses focused ultrasound to treat diseased tissue, and has made significant contributions to medical technology with innovations such as the EKG and gastroscope.[294][295][296]

In the social sciences, the Klein–Goldberger model, an enhanced macroeconomic model, was developed by Lawrence Klein and Arthur Goldberger at the university.[297] George Katona created consumer confidence measures in the late 1940s. J. David Singer initiated the Correlates of War project in 1963 to compile scientific knowledge about war.[298][299] The American National Election Studies, established with a National Science Foundation grant in 1977, has been based at the university and partnered with Stanford University since 2005.[citation needed] The Institute for Social Research, established in 1949, is the nation's longest-standing laboratory for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences.[300]

The university has been featured in multiple bibliometric rankings that assess its impact on academic publications through citation analysis. The University Ranking by Academic Performance for 2023–24 has positioned the university at 16th globally.[316] Additionally, in 2024, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked it 13th worldwide.[317] The university has a significant presence in the Nature Index, ranking 6th nationally and 23rd globally among research institutions, with a share of 365.97 and a count of 1199 in 2022.[305] The university boasted 28 researchers who were recognized by Clarivate as being highly cited in 2023.[301] In 2019, the university had 120 faculty members who were national academy members, placing it 10th among its peers in this metric.[275]

Undergraduate students participate in various research projects through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) as well as the UROP/Creative-Programs.[318][319][320]

The university is a member of the international research association Universities Research Association and the state-wise University Research Corridor.[321][322] Beginning in 2005, the university operated the UM-SJTU Joint Institute with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, but in 2025, it withdrew from the partnership due to national security concerns.[323]

As of fall 2023, the Ann Arbor campus had 52,065 students enrolled: 33,730 undergraduate students and 18,335 graduate students. The total number of employees reached 53,831, which included 21,475 individuals working with Michigan Medicine, 6,114 supplemental staff, 7,820 faculty members, and 18,422 regular staff.[13][325] The largest college at the university was the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts with 21,973 students (42.2% of the total student body), followed by the College of Engineering (11,113; 21.3%) and Ross School of Business (4,433; 8.1%). All other colleges each hosted less than 5% of the total student population.[326]

Intramural sports are popular, and there are recreation facilities for each of the three campuses.[343]

The Michigan Union and Michigan League are student activity centers located on Central Campus; Pierpont Commons is on North Campus. The Michigan Union houses a majority of student groups, including the student government. The William Monroe Trotter House, located east of Central Campus, is a multicultural student center operated by the university's Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs.[344] The University Activities Center (UAC) is a student-run programming organization and is composed of 14 committees.[345] Each group involves students in the planning and execution of a variety of events both on and off campus.

The Michigan Marching Band, composed of more than 350 students from almost all of U-M's schools,[346] is the university's marching band. Over 125 years old (with a first performance in 1897),[347] the band performs at every home football game and travels to at least one away game a year. The student-run and led University of Michigan Pops Orchestra is another musical ensemble that attracts students from all academic backgrounds. It performs regularly in the Michigan Theater. The University of Michigan Men's Glee Club, founded in 1859 and the second oldest such group in the country, is a men's chorus with over 100 members.[348] Its eight-member subset a cappella group, the University of Michigan Friars, which was founded in 1955, is the oldest currently running a cappella group on campus.[349] The University of Michigan is also home to over twenty other a cappella groups, including Amazin' Blue, The Michigan G-Men, and Compulsive Lyres, all of which have competed at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) finals in New York City. Compulsive Lyres are the first and only group from Michigan to claim an ICCA title, having won in 2002.[350] The Michigan G-Men are one of only six groups in the country to compete at ICCA finals four times, one of only two TTBB ensembles to do so, and placed third at the competition in 2015.[351] Amazin' Blue placed fourth at ICCA finals in 2017.

The University of Michigan also has over 380 cultural and ethnic student organizations on campus.[352] These range the Arab Student Association to Persian Student Association[353] to African Students Association[354] to even the Egyptian Student Association.[355]

Fraternities and sororities play a role in the university's social life; approximately seven percent of undergraduate men and 16% of undergraduate women are active in the Greek system.[356] Four different Greek councils—the Interfraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Panhellenic Association—represent most Greek organizations. Each council has a different recruitment process.[357]

National honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, and Tau Beta Pi have chapters at U-M.[358] Degrees "with Highest Distinction" are recommended to students who rank in the top 3% of their class, "with High Distinction" to the next 7%, and "with Distinction" to the next 15%. Students earning a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 who have demonstrated high academic achievement and capacity for independent work may be recommended for a degree "with Highest Honors", "with High Honors", or "with Honors".[358] Those students who earn all A's for two or more consecutive terms in a calendar year are recognized as James B. Angell Scholars and are invited to attend the annual Honors Convocation, an event which recognizes undergraduate students with distinguished academic achievements.[358]

The University of Michigan hosts three secret societies: Michigauma, Adara, and the Vulcans. Michigauma and Adara were once under the umbrella group "The Tower Society", the name referring to their historical locations in the Michigan Union tower. Michigauma was all-male while Adara was all-female, although both later became co-ed.

The student newspaper is The Michigan Daily, which was founded in 1890 and is editorially and financially independent from the university. The Daily publishes daily online content and a weekly print edition. The yearbook is the Michiganensian, founded in 1896. Other student publications at the university include the conservative Michigan Review and the Gargoyle Humor Magazine.

WCBN-FM (88.3 FM) is the student-run college radio station which plays in freeform format. WOLV-TV is the student-run television station that is primarily shown on the university's cable television system. WJJX was previously the school's student-run radio station. A carrier current station, it was launched in 1953.[361]

Violent crime is rare on campus, though there have been a few notorious cases, including Theodore Kaczynski's attempted murder of professor James V. McConnell and research assistant Nicklaus Suino in 1985. In 2022, David DePape, the man convicted of attacking Paul Pelosi, who is the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, targeted Gayle Rubin, an associate professor of anthropology and women’s studies at the university.[362] DePape testified during his trial that he hoped to use Nancy and Paul Pelosi in an effort to get to Gayle Rubin.[362]

In 2014, the University of Michigan was named one of 55 higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights "for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints." President Barack Obama's White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault was organized for such investigations.[363] Seven years later, in 2021, the university attracted national attention when a report commissioned by the university was released that detailed an investigation into sexual assault allegations against doctor Robert Anderson who reportedly abused at least 950 university students, many of whom were athletes, from 1966 to 2003.[364] Several football players from that time say football coach Bo Schembechler ignored and enabled the abuse and told players to "toughen up" after being molested.[365] Schembechler reportedly punched his then 10-year-old son Matthew after he reported abuse by Anderson.[366] Following the exposure of a similar history of abuse at Ohio State University, male survivors of both Anderson at Michigan and Strauss at Ohio State spoke out to combat sexual abuse.[367] The University of Michigan settled with the survivors for $490 million.[368]

The university's athletics history dates back to the late 19th century, with the baseball team founded in 1866, the football team established in 1879, and the men's tennis team originating in 1893. The university has 27 varsity intercollegiate sports, including 13 men's teams and 14 women's teams.[369]

The university's intercollegiate sports teams, known as the "Wolverines," participate in the Big Ten Conference in most sports, with the exception of the women's water polo team, which competes in the Collegiate Water Polo Association. The teams compete at the NCAA Division I level in all sports, including Division I FBS in football. The teams share the nickname "Wolverines" with several other collegiate athletic teams in the country, such as the Utah Valley Wolverines, the Grove City Wolverines, and the Morris Brown Wolverines.

In 1896, the university became a founding member of the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives, which later evolved into the Western Conference (1896–1899) and eventually became known as the Big Ten Conference (since 1950). However, by April 1907, just a decade later, the university was voted out of the conference for refusing to adhere to league rules. Following a nine-year absence, the university rejoined the conference in 1917.

In 1926, Harvard made an agreement to play football against Michigan, dropping Princeton from its schedule due to past rough matches. Princeton perceived this move as a threat to the 'Big Three' relationship, fearing it would lose its status as a rival to Harvard and be relegated to a secondary class. By the 1930s, the 'Big Three' was restored and expanded into the Ivy League in 1939.[370]

In 2023, during the NCAA's investigation into sign-stealing allegations against the football team's staff members, the university's board of regents considered the possibility of leaving the Big Ten conference due to dissatisfaction with the conference's handling of the investigation.[371][372]

The Ray Fisher Stadium, constructed in 1923, serves as the home venue for the baseball team. The Alumni Field at Carol Hutchins Stadium, formerly known as the Varsity Diamond, is the home field for the university's softball team. The Yost Ice Arena, opened in 1923, is the home arena for the men's ice hockey team. The Crisler Center, opened in 1967 and previously known as the University Events Building and Crisler Arena, serves as the home venue for the men's and women's basketball teams as well as the women's gymnastics team. The Phyllis Ocker Field, constructed in 1995 and built partially on the site of Regents Field, is the home venue for the university's field hockey teams.

Michigan Stadium is the largest stadium in the United States,[373][374][375] as well as the Western Hemisphere,[376][377] and ranks third globally.[378][379][380] The extra seat in the stadium's capacity is said to be "reserved" for former head coach Fritz Crisler.[381] Prior to the construction of Michigan Stadium in 1927, the football team played their home games at Regents Field. In 1902, Dexter M. Ferry donated land adjacent to Regents Field, and the entire complex was renamed Ferry Field. Ferry Field served as the home stadium for the football team until the opening of Michigan Stadium. Today, Ferry Field serves as a tailgating space for Michigan Stadium during football games.

The Michigan fight song, "The Victors", was written by student Louis Elbel in 1898. The song was declared by John Philip Sousa to be "the greatest college fight song ever written."[382] The song refers to the teams as being "the Champions of the West". At the time, the Big Ten Conference was known as the Western Conference.

Although mainly used at sporting events, the Michigan fight song is often heard at other events as well. U.S. President Gerald Ford had it played by the United States Marine Band as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977, in preference over the more traditional "Hail to the Chief",[383] and the Michigan Marching Band performed a slow-tempo variation of the fight song at his funeral.[384] The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's alma mater song is "The Yellow and Blue". A common rally cry is "Let's Go Blue!" which has a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major.[385]

Before "The Victors" was officially the university's fight song, the song "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight" was considered to be the school song.[386] After Michigan temporarily withdrew from the Western Conference in 1907, a new Michigan fight song, "Varsity", was written in 1911 because the line "champions of the West" was no longer appropriate.[387]

The Michigan football program ranks first in NCAA history in total wins (1,004 through the end of the 2023 season) and tied for 1st among FBS schools in winning percentage (.734).[388][389] The team won the first Rose Bowl game in 1902. the university had 40 consecutive winning seasons from 1968 to 2007, including consecutive bowl game appearances from 1975 to 2007.[390] The Wolverines have won a record 45 Big Ten championships. The program claims 12 national championships,[391][392] most recently winning the 2024 National Championship Game,[393] and has produced three Heisman Trophy winners: Tom Harmon, Desmond Howard, and Charles Woodson.[394]

The men's ice hockey team, which plays at Yost Ice Arena, has won nine national championships.[395]

The men's basketball team, which plays at the Crisler Center, has appeared in five Final Fours and won the national championship in 1989. The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992–1993 and 1995–1999 seasons in which illicit payments to players took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.[396] The men's basketball team has most recently won back-to-back Big Ten Tournament Championships.

More than 250 Michigan athletes or coaches have participated in Olympic events,[397] and as of 2021 its students and alumni have won 155 Olympic medals.[398] Through the 2012 Summer Olympics, 275 Michigan students and coaches had participated in the Olympics, winning medals in each Summer Olympic Games except 1896, and winning gold medals in all but four Olympiads. the university's students/student-coaches (e.g., notably, Michael Phelps) have won a total of 185 Olympic medals: 85 golds, 48 silvers, and 52 bronzes.[399]

In 10 of the past 14 years concluding in 2009, the university has finished in the top five of the NACDA Director's Cup, a ranking compiled by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics to tabulate the success of universities in competitive sports. The university has finished in the top 10 of the Directors' Cup standings in 21 of the award's 29 seasons between 1993–2021 and has placed in the top six in nine of the last 10 seasons.[400]

The university is also home to several public and research museums including but not limited to the University Museum of Art, University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, Detroit Observatory, Sindecuse Museum of Dentistry, and the LSA Museum of Anthropological Archaeology.

Kelsey Museum of Archeology has a collection of Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern artifacts.[401] Between 1972 and 1974, the museum was involved in the excavation of the archaeological site of Dibsi Faraj in northern Syria.[402] The Kelsey Museum re-opened November 1, 2009, after a renovation and expansion.[403]

The collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Art include nearly 19,000 objects that span cultures, eras, and media and include European, American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African art, as well as changing exhibits. The Museum of Art re-opened in 2009 after a three-year renovation and expansion.[404] UMMA presents special exhibitions and diverse educational programs featuring the visual, performing, film and literary arts that contextualize the gallery experience.[405]

The University of Michigan Museum of Natural History began in the mid-19th century and expanded greatly with the donation of 60,000 specimens by Joseph Beal Steere in the 1870s. The building also houses three research museums: the Museum of Anthropology, Museum of Paleontology. Today, the collections are primarily housed and displayed in the Ruthven Museums Building which was completed in 1928.[406]

The university was assisted in its formation in the 1810s by a Masonic lodge (Zion Lodge No. 1 F&AM), which provided much-needed financial support for its establishment.[407] Of the total amount subscribed to start the university, two-thirds came from the Masonic lodge and its members.[407] Since then, private donors have become an important source of funding for the university. Among the individuals who have made significant donations commemorated at the university are William Wilson Cook, Dexter Mason Ferry, the Ford family, the Nichols family, the Marsal Family, the Tisch Family, William Erastus Upjohn, John Stoughton Newberry, Clara Harrison Stranahan, William K. Brehm, William Morse Davidson, A. Alfred Taubman, Penny W. Stamps, and Ronald Weiser. The Zell Family Foundation, led by Sam and Helen Zell, has donated a total of $152 million to the university over the years.[408][409] Stephen M. Ross made a $200 million donation to the business school and athletic campus in 2013.[410] Ross made a separate $100 million contribution to the university in 2004.[411] Charles Munger pledged $110 million in 2013 for a graduate residence and fellowships.[412] In 2024, the Hong Kong-based Li Ka Shing Foundation endowed a professorship at the university to support research in biomedical engineering.[413]

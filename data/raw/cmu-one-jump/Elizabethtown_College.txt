Elizabethtown College (informally Etown) is a private college in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.[4]

Elizabethtown College was founded in 1899 by members of the Church of the Brethren in response to an initiative by Jacob G. Francis. Francis advocated for Elizabethtown because of the proximity to the railways. First classes for the new college were held on November 13, 1900, in the Heisey Building in downtown Elizabethtown. During its first two decades, the college operated as an academy, offering a limited curriculum centering on four-year teaching degrees and high school type classes.[citation needed]

In 1921, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction accredited the college, and authorized its first baccalaureate degrees in arts and sciences. Later, in 1928, the college was approved by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for pre-law education. In 1948, Elizabethtown College became accredited by the Middle States Association.[5]

The college's presidents were referred to as principals prior to 1902.

The college maintains 19 academic departments, offering 53 majors and 90+ minors and concentrations.[citation needed]

Over 50 years, the college's adult program evolved into what is known today as the School of Graduate and Professional Studies (SGPS). The school offers graduate degree programs, including Master of Business Administration, Curriculum and Instruction, and Master of Music Education.[6][better source needed]

Established in 1999, the Elizabethtown College Honors Program is a member of the National Collegiate Honors Council. The Honors Program was founded with an endowment gift from The Hershey Company.[citation needed]

The Office of Student Activities (OSA) serves as a co-curricular educator and facilitator in creating a social environment, such as through its T.G.I.S. and Student Involvement Fairs.[7]

Elizabethtown offers student-run media that include a newspaper—The Etownian;[8] a literary magazine—Fine Print;[9] a television station—ECTV-40; a radio station—WWEC 88.3 FM; and a yearbook—the Conestogan.[citation needed] Elizabethtown is affiliated with the Brethren Colleges Abroad (BCA) program, which allows students to study abroad.

Elizabethtown College is a member of NCAA Division III in the Landmark Conference. Although Elizabethtown College was founded in 1899, it was not until 1928 that the first officially sanctioned intercollegiate athletic contest was held.[10] In April 2013, the college accepted the invitation to join the Landmark Conference, effective July 1, 2014.[citation needed]

Murdoch University is a public university in Perth, Western Australia, and additional campuses in Singapore and Dubai. It began operations as the state's second university on 25 July 1973, and accepted its first undergraduate students in 1975. Its name is taken from Walter Murdoch, the Founding Professor of English and former Chancellor of the University of Western Australia. The main campus is located in Murdoch, a suburb of Perth.

The university is a verdant university and a member of the Innovative Research Universities. In 2018, Murdoch University was recognised as producing the most employable graduates of all Australian universities after three years of graduating from their courses.[14][15] In 2019, the university ranked third in overall student satisfaction amongst all public universities in Western Australia.[16]

In 1962, the Government of Western Australia earmarked an area of land in Bull Creek to be the site of a future, second, state university. Integral to the planning of the creation of Western Australia's second university was the planning for the School of Veterinary Science, which was to be the first professional faculty of the new university.[17]  It was decided that the new university would be named after Murdoch, a prominent local author, philosopher, and an Emeritus Professor at the University of Western Australia. When asked if he minded a new university in Western Australia being named in his honour, he was quoted as saying, "No, but it had better be a good one."[17]

Murdoch University was formally constituted on 25 July 1973. It was opened with an inauguration ceremony on 17 September 1974. This date was chosen as it was Murdoch's 100th birthday. The Governor-General of Australia, John Kerr, attended the ceremony as the guest of honour. Lectures began in 1975, with 510 students initially enrolled for undergraduate programs.[17]  At the time, the young university was notable for its admissions policy of taking into consideration eligibility factors other than the school leaving exam results of students. Other universities later came to adopt this more holistic perspective of student eligibility for entrance into university education.[17]

In late 2018, the university faced scandal subsequent to an enrolment surge of international students, many said to be "lacking English language and computing skills". In 2019, a Four Corners investigation by the ABC found further deterioration of standards with allegations of foreign students being recruited as "cash cows".[18]

In May 2021, the university unveiled a new brand, replacing the traditional banksia logo with a simplified "MU" logo intended to be "modern and future-focused",[19] as well as signifying the university's commitment to being a "progressive", "free thinking" university.[20]

Murdoch University has three Australian campuses: South Street Campus and Rockingham Campus in Perth, and Mandurah Campus.

The main campus is on South Street, Perth, in the suburb of Murdoch, near the Kwinana Freeway (32°03′58″S 115°50′06″E﻿ / ﻿32.066°S 115.835°E﻿ / -32.066; 115.835﻿ (Murdoch University, South Street campus)). South Street Campus is Australia's geographically largest campus at 2.27 square kilometres (0.88 sq mi),[21] large enough to accommodate the veterinary school and its animal stocks—the only such school in Western Australia.[22] Most of the southern part of the university consists of paddocks of livestock, farms and renewable energy facilities.[citation needed]

The master plan for the campus included an open quadrangle of grass and trees, known as Bush Court, in the northern part of Murdoch campus, which rises to the highest altitude on campus.  The library and first academic buildings flanking this court were designed by R. J. Ferguson, who also designed several buildings on the University of Western Australia campus. According to the foundation ethos of Murdoch University, there were to be no imposing buildings like the University of Western Australia's grand, Mediterranean-style Winthrop Hall, with its imposing clock tower. Rather, the architecture adopts a low-slung form redolent of a homestead, with covered walkways suggesting a hybrid veranda or cloister around the bush court. In the smaller courtyards exotic gardens, including a Chinese garden of rocks and stones, contrast with the bush court.[23] The planting and landscaping were the work of Marion Blackwell.[24]

Features of the campus include the Joglo Rahayu (Peace Pavilion), a semi-enclosed pavilion near the Education and Humanities building. A monument to the ongoing association between Murdoch University and Indonesian academic institutions in Java, it acts as storage for the Western Australian Gamelan Orchestra.[25]

The university recently established three "myMurdoch Advice" locations across campus, to assist with academic support, general advice about study, wellbeing and specialist advice for international students.[26] A newly renovated Student Hub is located off Bush Court, including a variety of food chains and seating.[27] The university also has a tavern and a restaurant named Sir Walter's.[28] A range of food trucks are also available via the Pop-Up Ref on the east side of the campus.[28]

The Rockingham Campus is located 38 kilometres (24 mi) south of central Perth in the suburb of Rockingham (32°16′41″S 115°45′04″E﻿ / ﻿32.278°S 115.751°E﻿ / -32.278; 115.751﻿ (Murdoch University, Rockingham campus)). Opened in 1996, it is co-located with Rockingham Challenger Institute of Technology campus, and features an arts and commerce building. The campus ceased offering undergraduate classes at the end of 2014 due to not enough students attending the campus.[27][29]

Rockingham Regional Campus Community Library, located at the Rockingham Campus, is a joint venture between the university, the City of Rockingham and Challenger Institute of Technology. Members of all of these groups have free access to library membership.

Membership entitles all patrons to access to Challenger Institute of Technology, university and public library resources at Rockingham.[30]

The Mandurah Campus is located 64 kilometres (40 mi) south of central Perth in the suburb of Greenfields, near the regional centre of Mandurah (32°30′58″S 115°45′22″E﻿ / ﻿32.516°S 115.756°E﻿ / -32.516; 115.756﻿ (Murdoch University, Mandurah campus)). Opened in 2004, it is home to the School of Health Professions' Bachelor of Nursing (formally Nursing and Midwifery). In Semester 2, 2015, this degree also became available for study at the South Street Campus. Murdoch University shares the campus with Challenger Institute and John Tonkin College (formerly Mandurah Senior College).[citation needed]

Murdoch University Dubai is a branch campus, established in 2008 in Dubai International Academic City to cater for the expanding Dubai media and financial sectors, and support Dubai's ambitions in providing an ongoing reserve of regional graduates connected to the demands of the region's booming industries.[citation needed]

The campus in Dubai offers degree programs in Commerce, Information Technology and Media and postgraduate programs in Business, Human Resource Management and Education. The Degree programs are fully compatible with those offered in Perth and carry full Australian accreditation as well as being certified by the Knowledge and Human Development Authority, Government of Dubai.[citation needed]

The Murdoch University International Study Centre (MUISC) in Singapore was officially opened in June 2008 by Australian High Commissioner Mr Miles Kupa.

The university's work with conservation management has including the protection of dugongs through drone-tracking devices,[43] and the use of space technology to track movement patterns of vulnerable whale sharks.[44] Murdoch researchers also work to protect the endangered native black cockatoos.[45]

Murdoch was the subject of an ABC Four Corners report on selling of placements and the associated student visas to seemingly unqualified people including those who had been previously rejected for Australian visas.[46] Subsequently, the Department of Home Affairs increased Murdoch's risk rating.[47]

The Asia Research Centre, founded in 1991, produced multi-disciplinary research in politics, political economy, modes of governance, social change, and policy making.

It also regularly engages in collaboration with researchers from other universities around the world.[48]

In 2022, Murdoch University launched the Indo-Pacific Research Centre[49] as the successor of the Asia Research Centre. The new centre facilitates innovative and policy-relevant research on security, conflict, development, and the environment in the Indo-Pacific region.[50] As of 2024, Prof Jacqueline Lo is the director of the Indo-Pacific Research Centre.[51]

picoCTF is a cybersecurity capture the flag competition hosted by CyLab. Established in 2013, the event is run annually over a period of two weeks and is geared towards high schoolers, billing itself as the largest high school cybersecurity event in the United States; the inaugural edition had 6,000 participants and 39,000 people competed in 2019.[11] The challenges, which are modeled around real-life cybersecurity problems, are themed around a different storyline each year.[12] The program aims to get high schoolers interested in computer security, offering cash prizes.[13]

Waffle Shop: A Reality Show was a performance art project and restaurant in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  The restaurant was operated by Carnegie Mellon University students.[1][2]  The Waffle Shop was part of a trend in Pittsburgh to support performance art within the urban core.[3]  In addition to serving food, students operate a talk show live-streamed online, featuring restaurant patrons as guests.[4][5]

It opened in 2008 by Carnegie Mellon University art professor Jon Rubin as a 2-semester student art project.[6]  The project/restaurant was so successful during that initial run that it was continued for several more years.[7]

Some special talk shop themes have included ringtones as "art."[8][9]

The related sign atop the building was also used for public art purposes,[10] and later became known as The Last Billboard. The billboard stayed in place and continued to be changed periodically until it was removed in April of 2018.[11]

Local food critics reviewed it relatively favorably, noting the unique talk show situation.[12][13]

It closed in 2012.

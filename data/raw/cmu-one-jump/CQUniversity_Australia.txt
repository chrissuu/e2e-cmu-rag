Central Queensland University (branded as CQUniversity) is an Australian public university based in central Queensland. CQUniversity is the only Australian university with a campus presence in every mainland state.[10] Its main campus is at Norman Gardens in Rockhampton, however, it also has campuses in Adelaide (Wayville), Brisbane, Bundaberg (Branyan), Cairns, Emerald, Gladstone (South Gladstone and Callemondah), Mackay (central business district and Ooralea), Melbourne, Noosa, Perth, Rockhampton City, Sydney and Townsville. CQUniversity also partners with university centres in several regional areas across Australia.[11]

The university was established in 1967 in Parkhurst as the Queensland Institute of Technology (Capricornia) and achieved full university status as the University of Central Queensland in 1992 before being renamed Central Queensland University in 1994.

In 1941, the Queensland Labor Premier, William Forgan Smith, introduced section 17 of the National Education Co-ordination and University of Queensland Amendment Act, which provided for the creation of university colleges outside Brisbane.[12] In 1944 and 1945, a series of Rockhampton delegations lobbied the Queensland government for a university college, but after the University of Queensland established a network of provincial study centres in the late 1940s the issue became dormant.[13]

Rockhampton's university campaign resumed in the 1950s as Central Queensland became an emerging heavy industry base, with developing coal mines and Gladstone emerging as a light metals centre.[14] In the Queensland parliament in November 1956, the local member for Rockhampton (H R Gardner) stated "more adequate facilities for technical education" were required for the region and, appealing to the philosophy of a "fair go", he urged that Rockhampton people be given "the same opportunities as those in Brisbane".[15] In 1958, P J Goldston, an engineer (later, Commissioner for Railways,) mooted the possibility of a Central Queensland university with Rockhampton engineers.

After further community discussion, the Central Queensland University Development Association (UDA) was constituted. The Rockhampton Mayor, Alderman Rex Pilbeam, called the first public meeting of UDA on 3 March 1959.[16]

The UDA presented university proposals to government and, in 1961, the Queensland government reserved 161 hectares (400 acres) of government land at Parkhurst (North Rockhampton) on the Bruce Highway near the Yeppoon turnoff as a tertiary education site.[17] Establishment finally was resolved in March 1965, when the Commonwealth government's Martin Report (on expansion of tertiary education) was tabled in parliament by Prime Minister Menzies―who announced the foundation of a new style of tertiary institution at both Rockhampton and Toowoomba.[18] The new institutes were to be affiliated with the main Queensland Institute of Technology campus in Brisbane and lacked the autonomy of universities, being controlled by the Queensland Department of Education.[19]

The Queensland Institute of Technology (Capricornia) first opened in February 1967 without a permanent campus or significant development of buildings. The initial intake was 71 full-time and part-time students.[20] While building progressed at Parkhurst, the first classes were held on the top floor of the Technical College in Bolsover Street, which lacked laboratories, library facilities or stock.[20]

By 1969, most staff and students transferred to the Parkhurst campus, still a bushland site in progress. In the summer months, the campus was often ringed by spectacular bush fires or deluged with torrential rain: cars slid in the mud or were bogged and the QITC's foundation Principal, Dr Allan Skertchly, ferried people in his 4WD across floodwaters.[21] Some students slept temporarily on mattresses in the canteen while waiting for the first residential college to open.[22]

After the passage of the amended Education Act in 1971, QITC became an autonomous, multi-functional college under the control of its own council and took the name of Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education (CIAE).[23]

Along with creating a traditional university campus experience in a natural setting, the CIAE also developed engineering and science projects.[24] The CIAE became the first college in Australia to introduce a Bachelor of Science externally in 1974.[25]

By 1979, external enrolments at the CIAE had increased to 825 and by 1985 distance education had become a major campus operation, exceeding internal enrolments and offering 12 courses involving some 100 subjects and processing 23,980 study packages annually.[26]

Between 1978 and 1989, the CIAE established branch campuses in Central Queensland at Gladstone, Mackay, Bundaberg and Emerald.[27]

The Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education became the University College of Central Queensland in 1990 under the sponsorship of the University of Queensland.[28]

The University College of Central Queensland became the University of Central Queensland in 1992 when it gained full university status.[28]


In 1994, the name Central Queensland University was adopted. In 2008 it was rebranded with the current title of CQUniversity Australia. [29][30]
In 2001, the university appointed Queensland's first female Vice-Chancellor, Professor Glenice Hancock, who retired in 2004.[31]

From 2009 onward, CQUniversity launched a new strategic plan to grow student numbers and expand course offerings, especially within the health disciplines. New course offerings included physiotherapy,[32] podiatry,[33] occupational therapy,[34] speech pathology,[35] oral health[36] sonography,[37] and medical imaging.[38] CQUniversity also delivers courses in discipline areas including apprenticeships, trades and training, business, accounting and law, creative, performing and visual arts, education and humanities, engineering and built environment, health, information technology and digital media, psychology, social work and community services, science and environment, and work and study preparation.[citation needed]

In 2014, CQUniversity merged with CQ TAFE to establish Queensland's first dual sector university.[39] CQUniversity is now the public provider of TAFE in the central Queensland region and also delivers vocational courses at other locations across Australia and online. Following the merger CQUniversity now delivers more than 300 courses from short courses through to PhDs.[10]

CQUniversity is the only Australian university to be accredited as a Changemaker Campus[40] by global social innovation group Ashoka U.

In March 2018 the university announced it was in talks to establish a medical school at its Rockhampton and Bundaberg campuses.[41] Discussions are with the Hospital and Health Services of Central Queensland and Wide Bay, the main physical organisation of Queensland Health in the two regions.[42]

CQUniversity has the following campuses:[43]

CQUniversity partners with a range of Regional University Centres at multiple sites across Australia providing infrastructure and academic support for students studying via distance with nominated partner universities.[citation needed]

Two campuses operate in the Rockhampton region: Rockhampton, City (formerly CQ TAFE) and Rockhampton, North.

After the Australian government approved the enrolment of full-fee paying students in Australian institutions in 1986, the CIAE (and subsequently the university) began trans national education ventures with many countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai and Fiji.  Through a public-private partnership with CMS (which CQU fully acquired in 2011) the university opened its first international campus in Sydney in 1994, followed by international campuses in Melbourne in 1997, Brisbane in 1998 and the Gold Coast in 2001.[64][65]

CQUniversity is governed by the CQUniversity Council, comprising the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and various elected and appointed representatives.[66][67] It was established under the Central Queensland University Act (1998).[68][69] Operationally, CQUniversity is managed by the Vice-Chancellor and five Deputy Vice-Chancellors who oversee portfolios including: International and Services, Research, Tertiary Education, Student Experience and Governance, Engagement and Campuses, Strategic Development and Finance and Planning. The Vice-Chancellor is appointed by the University Council and reports to the Council through the Chancellor.[citation needed]

In 2012, CQUniversity lifted its rankings in the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) audit from 28 (in 2010) to 21.[89] The university picked up three five-star ratings in 2012, up from its 2010 result of just two three-star ratings.[90] CQUniversity performed at or well above world standard in four areas of research according to ERA 2012, with nursing research continuing to perform at 'world standard', and research in applied mathematics, agriculture and land management, and other medical and health sciences deemed to be ranked at the highest levels of performance 'well above world standard'.[91]

CQUniversity has numerous research centres, institutes and groups including:

The university is also a partner in the Queensland Centre for Social Science Innovation (QCSSI) together with the Queensland State Government, University of Queensland (UQ), Griffith University (GU), Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and James Cook University (JCU). The QCSSI is based at the St Lucia campus of UQ.[93]

The university began collecting art in the 1970s and has since developed a collection of almost 600 art works, including international and Australian paintings, ceramics, prints and photographs. While there is not a gallery or museum space at the university, art works are displayed across the campus network and lent to other organisations, such as regional galleries and other universities, for display in temporary exhibitions.[citation needed]

For international students starting in 2025, tuition fees range from A$15,600 to A$53,220 per academic year for award programs lasting at least one year.[94] Domestic students[a] may be offered a federally-subsidised Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) which substantially decreases the student contribution amount billed to the student.[96] The maximum student contribution amount limits that can be applied to CSP students are dependent on the field of study.[97]

Since 2021, Commonwealth Supported Places have also been limited to 7 years of equivalent full-time study load (EFTSL), calculated in the form of Student Learning Entitlement (SLE).[98] Students may accrue additional SLE under some circumstances (e.g. starting a separate one-year honours program) or every 10 years.[98] Domestic students are also able to access the HECS-HELP student loans scheme offered by the federal government.[99] These are indexed to the Consumer or Wage Price Index, whichever is lower, and repayments are voluntary unless the recipient passes an income threshold.[99]

The university also offers several scholarships, which come in the form of bursaries or tuition fee remission.[100]

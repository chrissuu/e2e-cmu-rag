The Saint Francis Red Flash are the 22 sports teams representing Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania in intercollegiate athletics. The Red Flash competes in the NCAA Division I and are primary members of the Northeast Conference, with women's water polo competing in the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA).

On March 25, 2025, Saint Francis announced that its athletic programs would move to Division III at the conclusion of the 2025–26 academic year, and join the Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC). The school cited increasing complexities in governance in Division I athletics, including the transfer portal and name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, as well as student welfare, as being among the factors in the decision.[2][3]

Student-athletes already on athletic scholarships as of 2025 will continue to receive aid through the end of the 2027–28 academic year, provided they continue participating in Saint Francis athletics.[4] This would only impact student-athletes that have a redshirt year before 2028, since all others would have used their eligibility by then.

Student-athletes in the 2025 recruiting class will be eligible for athletic scholarships. However, these scholarships will expire at the conclusion of the 2026–27 academic year, i.e. the first Division III transitional year. After the transition to Division III begins in 2026, Saint Francis will play schedules in its sponsored sports primarily comprising Division III opponents. Saint Francis will not become eligible for NCAA Division III championships until the 2029–30 academic year.[5] Since the PAC does not sponsor women's water polo and field hockey, Saint Francis is pursuing affiliate membership in one or more other conferences for those sports.[4] The CWPA has a Division III women's water polo conference into which Saint Francis could transfer.

Susquehanna University is a private liberal arts college in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States.[4][5] Its name is derived from the original Susquehannock settlers of the region. Founded in 1858 as a missionary institute, it became a four-year liberal arts college in 1895. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In addition to an arts and sciences focus, Susquehanna has a business school, master's degrees in education and joint-degree programs in engineering and for a Master of Business Administration.

The academic programs are within the four schools of the Arts, Humanities, Natural and Social Sciences, and the AACSB International-accredited Sigmund Weis School of Business. Susquehanna University enrolls more than 2,200 undergraduate students from 33 states and 23 countries,[6] and maintains a student-to-faculty ratio of 13 to 1.

The institution was founded by Benjamin Kurtz, its first president. Having already assisted in the founding of Gettysburg Seminary, Kurtz wanted to create another institution to serve American Lutheranism.

Kurtz's mission was to "educate men for the gospel ministry ... who cannot take a full course of training adapted to their age and circumstances." The American Lutherans of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, provided 50 students, pledged $22,000, and offered the provisional use of its church facilities.[7] However, they stipulated that the institute be expanded to a junior college and that a sister college for women also be formed.[8]

On September 1, 1858, the Missionary Institute of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and Susquehanna Female College were established and legally recognized 23 days later. It had two departments: the theology department and the classical department. In 1873, the sister college disbanded and the institute became co-educational.

The institute officially became known as Susquehanna University in 1895.[9]

The 20th century brought many changes. The institution had recently begun offering bachelor degrees and changed its name to reflect that.[10] In 1903, the board approved Susquehanna’s colors, orange and maroon.[11]

By the 1920s, student enrollment skyrocketed, accommodations were refurbished and the campus expanded, and academic departments and offerings were enhanced.[12]

Susquehanna University is devoted primarily to undergraduate education. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.[13] Susquehanna has a student-to-faculty ratio of 13:1 with 90% of full-time faculty holding a doctorate or highest equivalent degree.[14]

The institution offers more than 100 majors, minors and programs[15] and allows students to design their own major, complete a double degree, or start undeclared.[16] Susquehanna offers pre-professional programs in pre-law, pre-veterinary medicine and teaching, and coordinates degrees with several other universities.[17][18][19] In 2016, an average of 96% of graduates were enrolled in graduate school or employed within six months of graduation.[20]

Susquehanna University consists of four schools: School of the Arts, School of Humanities, School of Natural and Social Sciences, and the Sigmund Weis School of Business.

The GO Program, as part of a school policy adopted in 2009, requires all Susquehanna students go off-campus for cross-cultural learning. Students have a choice between GO Short programs of 2–3 weeks or semester-long GO Long programs.[30] In 2013, the GO Program was awarded the Andrew Heiskell Award for Innovation in International Education[31]

The Susquehanna University campus spans 297 acres (120 ha) in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. There are more than 50 buildings on campus, primarily in the style of Georgian architecture. The campus has four buildings that are Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified (LEED) by the U.S. Green Building Council: two residence halls, the Natural Sciences Center, and the Admission House. [32]

Students are guaranteed housing all four years, and nearly all students live on campus.[33][34]

Selinsgrove Hall is a 3+1⁄2-story brick structure constructed in 1858 in the Italianate style. The roof features a wooden cupola and the structure was previously featured on the institution's logo. Seibert Hall is a 2+1⁄2-story brick structure constructed in 1902 in a restrained Colonial Revival style.[35] Both Selinsgrove Hall and Seibert Hall, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[36]


In 2017, the institution dedicated a $7 million space to welcome prospective students and families. According to the Susquehanna's website, Admission House was funded through contributions from the board of trustees.[37] Unlike most other buildings on campus, the Admission House has a white facade instead of a naturally red-brick exterior. The 15,500-square-foot (1,440 m2) building was designed by architect Peter Bohlin of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson as a modern take on a barn. [37]
The Natural Sciences Center is a $32-million academic building that houses Susquehanna’s biology, chemistry, earth and environmental science, neuroscience, ecology, health care studies, and pre-professional  programs.[38] It received Silver LEED certification.[38] The 81,000-square-foot (7,500 m2) building was dedicated in 2010.[39]

In 2018, Susquehanna University completed a 14-acre (5.7 ha) solar array with WGL Energy to supply 30 percent of the institution's electricity. At the time, it was the largest college- or university-sponsored solar array in Pennsylvania, and one of the largest solar projects in the Commonwealth. The 12,000-panel array is estimated to produce over 5,300 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity per year.[40]

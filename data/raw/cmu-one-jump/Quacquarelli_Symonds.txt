The QS World University Rankings is a portfolio of university rankings. Its first edition was published in collaboration with Times Higher Education (THE) magazine as Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings, inaugurated in 2004 to provide an independent source of comparative data about university performance. In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings.

The rankings use university reputation according to surveys of academics and employers, together with proxies such as proportion of international students an numbers of citations per publication to rank universities. The rankings have been criticized for its over-reliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to form a feedback loop.[8]

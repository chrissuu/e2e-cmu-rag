WRCT (88.3 FM) is a non-commercial freeform radio station based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[2] The volunteer-run station has a studio in the basement of Carnegie Mellon's University Center.[3] WRCT broadcasts throughout the city with an ERP of 1.75 kW, from atop Warner Hall. WRCT Radio, Inc. holds the station's license.[2]

WRCT or Radio Carnegie Tech started as an experimental radio station at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1949 by engineering students.[4][3] The students used electrical wiring to broadcast a weak AM signal to a few academic buildings for several hours each day.[4][3] In 1950, WRCT became an official student organization and covered half the buildings on campus.[4]

WRCT started as a carrier current AM radio station on 900 kHz, but moved to 88.3 FM on March 1, 1974, with a power of 10 watts.[3] This extended its signal across campus and to nearby areas.[3] In the late 1980s, the power increased to 100 watts.

In 1994, WRCT received permission to increase power to 1,750 watts[2] in the north, south, and west and 680 watts in the east, allowing it to be heard up to fifteen miles away. The station also streams audio on the Internet through the station's website.[3]

Volunteers from the Carnegie Mellon campus and the community run the station, serving as disc jockeys, producers, engineers, and support staff.[3]

WRCT's mission is to present its listening audience with freeform, original programming not found on the other radio stations in Pittsburgh.[3]

The on-air DJs select the station's varied musical programming. WRCT's record library includes almost 70,000 records and CDs.[3] Musical genres commonly in rotation include alternative country, blues, electronic, experimental, hip hop, heavy metal, indie rock, jazz, musical theater, and world music.[4] Programmers also play locally produced music, including creative beats, conscious lyrics, and new artists.[5]

WRCT's public affairs programming emphasizes news and issues from the Pittsburgh community. The station's original programming includes:

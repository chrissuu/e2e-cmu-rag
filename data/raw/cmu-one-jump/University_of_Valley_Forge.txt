The University of Valley Forge (UVF) is a private university near Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, and 8.8 miles (14.2 km) from Valley Forge National Historical Park. It is affiliated with the Assemblies of God USA.[3]

The college, in Chester County, is partially in Charlestown Township,[4] while the other part is in Schuylkill Township.[5] It has a Phoenixville postal address.[6]

The University of Valley Forge began as a summer Bible School on the campgrounds of Maranatha Park in Green Lane, Pennsylvania, in 1932. It existed for the training of pastors, evangelists, missionaries, Christian education workers, and lay workers.[3] The summer Bible School grew into a permanent Bible School and, in 1939, was chartered as Eastern Bible Institute. Mergers with the Beulah Heights Bible Institute, Metropolitan Bible Institute, New England Bible Institute, and Pine Crest Bible School resulted in increased enrollment and a name change to Northeast Bible Institute in 1962. The school received its accreditation from the state in 1975 and subsequently became the Northeast Bible College.

The institute moved in 1976 to the campus of the former Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville. One year later, the school changed its name to reflect its new location, becoming the Valley Forge Christian College.[7]

In the summer of 2002, the college was granted accreditation with Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Valley Forge Christian College then officially changed its name to the University of Valley Forge on September 16, 2014.[8]

Today the school has an enrollment of 583 students (including 508 undergraduate students)[9] and offers 40+ undergraduate programs[10] and ten graduate programs.[11]

The University of Valley Forge is authorized by the Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to grant the degrees of Master of Arts, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Religious Education, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Social Work, Associate of Arts, and Associate of Science.

UVF teams, known as the Patriots, compete at the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The university joined the Colonial States Athletic Conference in the 2020-2021 academic year. UVF then became a member of the United East Conference after the pre-existing UEC and CSAC merged in 2023.[12] Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, and volleyball. Intramural golf and cross country are also offered as club sports.

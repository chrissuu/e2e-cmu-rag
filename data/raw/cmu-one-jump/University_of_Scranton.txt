The University of Scranton is a private Jesuit university in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1888 by William O'Hara, the first Bishop of Scranton, as St. Thomas College.[2] In 1938, the college was elevated to university status and took the name The University of Scranton.[3] The institution was operated by the Diocese of Scranton from its founding until 1897. While the Diocese of Scranton retained ownership of the university, it was administered by the Lasallian Christian Brothers from 1888 to 1942.[4] In 1942, the Society of Jesus took ownership and control of the university.[5] During the 1960s, the university became an independent institution under a lay board of trustees.

The university is composed of three colleges that each contain both undergraduate and graduate programs.[6] It offers 65 bachelor's degrees, 29 master's degrees, and 4 doctoral programs.[7]

The university enrolls approximately 6,000 graduate and undergraduate students. Most of its students are from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.[6] In 2016, about 58% of its undergraduate students were women and 42% men.[8] In its graduate programs, about 62% are women students and 38% men. The university has about 300 full-time faculty members, approximately 200 of which are tenured.[6]

In 1888 the first bishop of Scranton, William O'Hara, began construction of St. Thomas College, the predecessor of the University of Scranton. In September 1892 the college admitted its first students, 62 young men. Staffing passed from diocesan priests and seminarians, to Xaverian Brothers, and after 1897 to Lasallian Christian Brothers. In 1897 the school was broken into three divisions: the college department, a two-year commercial program, and St. Thomas High School which remained open until 1939. Jesuit priest Daniel J. MacGoldrick came from Georgetown University to serve as president from 1895 until his death in 1900. The college awarded degrees through other colleges until 1924, when it received a State charter to grant bachelor's degrees in arts and science, and the master of science. In 1938, the Christian Brothers renamed the college "University of Scranton" and began admitting women to the evening division.[9][10][11]

The Drama Club began productions in 1893. The Aquinas began as a literary monthly in 1915, furnishing also a yearbook edition, evolving into a student newspaper in 1931, and by the 21st century adding a web edition. The current Windhover yearbook was first published in 1948 and named for the bird's loyalty to its master. The Glee Club dates to 1925. In 1931 the college band began playing at sports events and presenting a spring concert.[9] Three members of the university faculty began producing Best Sellers: The Semi-Monthly Book Review in 1941; it remained in print until 1987.[12]

In 1942 governance of the University of Scranton passed over to the Society of Jesuits. In 1944 Scranton Preparatory School was founded, with its first quarters in a former private hospital building; it moved to its present location in 1963 and became independent of the university in 1978.[9][13][14]

With the influx of veterans after World War II, three barracks were constructed on the former Scranton Estate and served as classroom space over the following 15 years.[11][10] After 1946 the athletic teams ceased to be the Tomcats and were called the Royals after the purple color of their uniforms. The Graduate School opened in 1950, soon adding programs in Education, Business Administration, Chemistry, History, and English; all admitted women from the start. In 1951 an Army ROTC unit was established and made obligatory for non-veterans through freshman and sophomore years.[15][9]

An expansion plan, beginning at $5,000,000, produced fifteen new buildings between 1956 and 1966, with Loyola Hall of Science in 1956 and the first residence halls for students in 1958: Casey, Fitch, Martin, and McCourt. Three years later Denis Edward, Hafey, Lynett, and Hannan residence halls were added.[16] With the death of Worthington Scranton in 1958, the university acquired the remainder of his properties.[17] Alumni Memorial Library was completed in 1960[18] and Gunster Memorial Student Center in 1961, including the 400-seat Eagen Auditorium. In 1962 the five-storey classroom building St. Thomas Hall was built, which included St. Ignatius Loyola Chapel. At this time the original Wyoming Avenue properties were completely vacated.[19][20] New construction extended to Driscoll and Nevils residence halls in 1965, raising on-campus housing to 650 male students.[16] In 1967 the first varsity athletic center was completed and named after former president John J. Long who had led the building campaign over more than a decade.[21][22][9]

Esprit, the university's review of arts and letters, first appeared in 1958 and Flannery O'Connor, friend of a Jesuit, visited the campus to help get it launched.[9]

After campus protests against the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, participation in the ROTC became voluntary in 1969.[23] The same year other regulations were changed: the requirement that students wear coat and tie to class was dropped,[24] students of age were allowed to drink in the dormitories,[25] and only underclassmen with failing grades were subject to a curfew.[26] After 1970 females could visit male dormitories until 10:00 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 a.m. on weekends.[27] The common core curriculum added options after 1970.[28]

In 1966 a university senate was established, whereby faculty and administrators, and later student representatives, could make recommendations to the board of trustees.[29] Until 1969 the Jesuit community exercised ownership of the university. In 1969 lay members were first admitted to a newly independent Board of Trustees.[30][31] While women had been admitted to evening school and summer classes since 1938, it was only in 1972 that they were first admitted to the College of Arts and Science. Fitch Hall, the first women's residence, opened that fall.[9]

Linden Street was closed to form the university commons in 1980 and sculptures were added to beautify the campus: Jacob and the Angel (1982), Ignatius of Loyola and fountain (1988), and Christ the Teacher (1998). The World Premiere Composition Series began performing new works by composers in 1984 and has continued this annual showcase.[32] During the 16-year presidency of Jesuit priest Joseph A. Panuska, two capital campaigns enabled the construction of major new buildings, including the Byron Recreational Complex (1986), Hyland classroom building (1988), Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Memorial Library (1992), and McDade Center for the Performing Arts (1993).  Upon Panuska's departure, the Board of Trustees renamed in his honor the College of Health, Education, and Human Resources which he had founded in 1987.[9]

In 2000 the Kania School of Management moved to the new, five-storey hall named for John E. Brennan ‘68. The Department of Physical Therapy, founded in 1980, became in 2004 the university's first doctoral program, receiving CAPTE certification in 2007. In fall 2011, the new Loyola Science Center added 22 class and seminar rooms and 34 laboratories.[33] Pilarz and Montrone halls on Mulberry Street provided more fitness space, a dining area, and apartment-style units to accommodate 400 juniors and seniors. In 2015 Leahy Hall was dedicated to accommodate the area of physical therapy.[9]

In 1942 the university was primarily a commuter school with fewer than 1,000 students. By 2015 it had come to serve a wide region with an enrollment of approximately 5,500 students in undergraduate, graduate, and nontraditional programs. The university's strategic plan for 2015-2020 looks to build on the Jesuit heritage with education that is "engaged, integrated, global". [34]

The university grants undergraduate degrees (Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science) in 65 majors. Students may also utilize many pre-professional concentrations, such as pre-medical, pre-law, and pre-dental. The university also has an Honors Program and the SJLA (Special Jesuit Liberal Arts) Program in which select students complete courses in moral philosophy, ethics, theology, and the humanities in addition to their normal course load.

The university also grants graduate degrees in 29 fields, ranging from Accounting and Chemistry to Software Engineering and Theology. The university also offers a Doctor of Physical Therapy program and Doctor of Nursing Practice.

The university offers a liberal arts program. Students are required to take the core courses in composition. Students are also required to take two theology courses, two philosophy courses, as well as an elective in one of these two areas. Filling out the general education requirements are 6 credits in science courses, 6 credits in writing intensive courses, 6 credits in cultural diversity courses, 3 credits in a mathematics course, 12 credits in humanities courses and 3 credits in physical education.

The honors program, first created in 1963 by Academic Vice President William Kelly, stresses independent work and individualized engagement with faculty.[3] The program gives students the opportunity to pursue their research interests through one-on-one tutorials with professors and culminating in a year-long thesis project.[35] Honors Students must take one course, between three and five tutorials, two seminars and the final 6-credit project. Honors courses count toward general education requirements and the tutorials count toward major, minor, cognate or general education requirements.[36] Students can apply to the Honors Program in the fall of their sophomore year. Because a minimum of a 3.5 GPA is required for graduation in the Honors Program, applicants must have at least a 3.3 GPA to be considered. Admission is also based on the applicant's high school and college records, SAT scores, application, recommendations, and interviews. Normally around 50 students are accepted into the program.[36]

The Business Leadership program (BLDR), an honors program in the Kania School of Management (KSOM), teaches students the key components of leadership.[37] The program includes special sections of key business courses taught from the leadership perspective, leadership seminars, a mentor/internship program, and an independent leadership project.[38][39] The program culminates in the students preparing portfolios on the essence of leadership, as derived from participation in the program, and defending their concepts of leadership before a faculty board.[40] The program accepts 15 sophomores each spring to begin the two-year curriculum the following fall based upon leadership experience and/or potential, student records from high school and college, involvement in clubs and activities, recommendations from professors, and a minimum GPA of a 3.0, because students need at least a 3.5 GPA to graduate with the program.[38][41]

The Special Jesuit Liberal Arts program (SJLA) was established in 1975 to model the traditional Jesuit liberal arts education that emphasizes philosophy, theology, history and literature of the Western classical and Christian ages while providing a way for students to fulfill the general education requirements.[42][43][44] Through the courses, students develop enhanced writing, oral and critical-thinking skills while also becoming immersed in a community atmosphere that encourages excellence and service to others and an awareness of contemporary issues.[45][46] Before the start of freshman year, the most qualified incoming students, usually in the top five percent of applicants, are invited to join the four year SJLA program. Students not selected initially may apply for admission as second semester freshmen or as sophomores.[47]

The University of Scranton maintains local chapters of over thirty different international and national honor societies.

Scranton placed sixth in U.S. News & World Report's 2021 rankings of the "Best Regional Universities North".[59] It was also rated tied for 14th out of 38 in "Best Undergraduate Teaching" and 40th out of 73 in "Best Value Schools".[59]

The Princeton Review has named the university to its annual “Best Colleges," guidebook from 2002 to its most recent list for 2017.[60]

An October 2015 report by The Economist ranked The University of Scranton No. 22 in the nation (top 2% of four-year colleges) for the impact a Scranton education has on the earnings of its graduates.[61] The Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, published in October 2015, ranked The University of Scranton among the top 100 colleges in the nation for the increase in annual earnings it contributes to its graduates at 10 years after enrollment.[62]

The university has 13 traditional residences: Casey Hall, Denis Edward Hall, Driscoll Hall, Fitch Hall, Gannon Hall, Giblin-Kelly Hall, Lavis Hall, McCormick Hall, Hafey Hall, Lynett Hall, Martin Hall, McCourt Hall, Nevils Hall, which provide housing for freshman students. These residence halls contain traditional double-rooms that share a community restroom on each floor. Most of these buildings were constructed in the 1960s, when the university was becoming a residential campus.

Sophomore students are offered suite-style housing, in which two double rooms share a shower and toilet, with each room having its own sink. There are three buildings, clustered together on the edge of the campus, which house sophomores: Condron Hall (2008), Redington Hall, and Gavigan Hall.[161]

Junior and senior students are offered apartments and houses, which have more private options for residents. The university's apartment buildings include: Linden St. Apartments, Madison Square, Mulberry Plaza, Montrone Hall, and Pilarz Hall. The university also owns a number of residential houses scattered throughout the campus and the historic Hill Section of the city which they use to house students depending on the need for additional housing, most of which were originally acquired during the 1970s and 1980s. These include: Blair House, Fayette House, Gonzaga House, Herold House, Liva House, McGowan House, Cambria House, Monroe House, Tioga House, and Wayne House. After sophomore year, students can also elect to live off-campus in the residential and historic Hill Section located adjacent to the university's campus.

Graduate students can either chose to rent houses in the Hill Section, or live in the university-owned Quincy Apartments, located on the 500 block of Quincy Avenue which was just transformed from an abandoned high school into an early childhood learning center and University graduate housing in 2015.[162][163]

In 2018 The university renamed McCormick Hall MacKillop Hall and Hannan Hall Giblin-Kelly Hall.  The building named Timlin Hall within Mulberry Plazza had its name removed and Mulberry Plazza was renamed Romero Plazza.

These three buildings which were named after Bishops J. Carroll McCormick, Jerome D. Hannan, and James C. Timlin were renamed after a Pennsylvania grand jury report found these bishops ignored accusations of clergy sexual abuse. The university also rescinded honorary degrees bestowed on these three men.[164]

Scranton athletes compete at the NCAA Division III. In 2007, Scranton joined the newly formed Landmark Conference, which ended a long history with the Middle Atlantic/Freedom Conference.

The university offers 19 varsity sports and has won national championships in Men's Basketball in 1976 and 1983 and Women's Basketball in 1985.[165] The university's basketball teams play at the John Long Center located in the heart of the campus. The university's soccer and field hockey teams play at Fitzpatrick Field, also on campus.

Scranton's athletics teams include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track and field. Men's only sports are baseball and wrestling while women's activities include field hockey, softball, and volleyball.

In February 2012, the university fully acquired the South Side Sports Complex in Scranton. The complex was converted into NCAA-regulation fields for soccer, baseball, and softball. The complex includes a child's play area and public basketball courts.[166]

In February 2016, the athletic director suspended the Men's and Women's Swimming and Diving team from the Landmark Conference championship meet for alleged hazing.[167][168]

In fall 2016, women's golf was added to the athletics program. They debuted with a 5–0 victory in September 2016.[169]

The Aquinas, the university's student newspaper, publishes on Thursdays during the academic year. WUSR 99.5 is the college radio station owned and operated by the University of Scranton.

The Student Senate came about in the spring semester of 2002 with the ratification of its Constitution. On May 3, 2002, the first Student Senate meeting was held in the Office of Student Activities. Today, the Student Senate assembles for regular sessions on a biweekly basis and for emergency sessions as necessary.

The Student Senate is the main avenue of governance for the students. The Student Senate deals with pertinent issues that affect the day-to-day lives of students at The University of Scranton. The Senate is chaired by the vice-president of student government, who votes only in the case of a tie. The other Executive members of student government are the president, a nonvoting member with veto authority, as well as the secretary and treasurer, both non-voting members. The body of the Student Senate is made up of the non-voting executive positions, and four equal representatives from each class, two commuter representatives, two off-campus representatives, and two resident representatives for a total of 26 members, 22 of which have voting rights.

There are four standing committees formed out of the Senate: Safety and Crime Prevention, Student Life and Dining Services, Academic Affairs, and Appropriations. Proposed legislation is sent to the appropriate committee for research and development at the discretion of the chair. The executive treasurer advises the Appropriations Committee; a senator appointed by the executive council chairs each of the committees.

The University of Scranton Press was a university press that was part of The University of Scranton. Its publications included books on religious and philosophical issues and local (Northeastern Pennsylvania) history, including coal mining. In the summer of 2010, the university announced that it was no longer accepting submissions for publication and would discontinue the Press after all current projects were completed, which it did by the end of the summer.

There have been 24 presidents of the University of Scranton and four acting presidents.

There are more than 49,000 alumni worldwide.[170]

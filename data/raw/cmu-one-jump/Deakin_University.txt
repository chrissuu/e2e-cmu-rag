Deakin University is a public research university in Victoria, Australia. The university was named after Alfred Deakin, the early three-time Prime Minister of Australia and a founding father of Australian Federation.[12][13]

The university's foundation dates back to the opening of the Gordon Memorial Technical College in 1887, later renamed as the Gordon Institute of Technology in 1921. It would then merge with the Geelong State College in 1974 to form Deakin University.[14] Its main campuses are in Melbourne's Burwood suburb, Geelong Waurn Ponds, Geelong Waterfront, and Warrnambool.[15][16]

As of 2024,[update] Deakin University is ranked among the top 1% of universities in the world,[17] with some of its disciplines ranked within the world's top 100.[18][19][20] Deakin Business School has accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and EQUIS.[21][22]

Deakin University consistently ranks highly in student satisfaction. Deakin has had the highest undergraduate student satisfaction ratings and in the top two for highest postgraduate student satisfaction out of all Victorian universities every year since 2010.[23]

Deakin University was established as a merger between State College of Victoria, Geelong (formerly Geelong Teachers College), and the higher education courses of the Gordon Institute of Technology, which originally opened in 1887 as the Gordon Memorial Technical College. The vocational part of the Gordon Institute of Technology continues separately as the Gordon Institute of TAFE nowadays.

Deakin University was formally established with the passage of the Deakin University Act 1974.[24] Deakin University's first campus was established at Waurn Ponds, previously a campus of the Gordon Institute of Technology.

The Burwood campus is on the site of the former Burwood Teachers' College, and also takes in the former sites of the Bennettswood Primary School and the Burwood Secondary School. The teachers' college conducted two-year training courses for Primary School teachers, and three year courses for Infant Teachers (females only). It provided live-on-site accommodation for country students.

As part of the Dawkins education reforms that were announced in 1988 by the Commonwealth government, a merger with Warrnambool Institute of Advanced Education took place in 1990,[25] which was followed by a merger with most of Victoria College in 1991, with its campuses in Burwood, Rusden and Toorak.[26]

The Rusden Campus was closed in 2003 and all courses were transferred to the Melbourne Burwood campus. Rusden was subsequently acquired by Monash University for its student accommodation purposes.

The former Toorak Campus, located in Malvern, was offered for sale in 2006 as the university considered the campus surplus to its requirements.[27] The courses and resources were relocated to the Melbourne Burwood campus in November 2007.[28] As a Deakin campus, it was home to the Deakin Business School, Deakin University English Language Institute (DUELI), and the Melbourne Institute of Business and Technology,[27] which have now become the Deakin College.

The main building on the site was the 116-year-old Stonnington Mansion[29] The sale of Stonnington Mansion by Deakin provoked public outrage as it involved the mansion which was at risk of redevelopment by property developers.[29] The Stonnington Stables art gallery and the university's contemporary art collection were located here,[27] but has since relocated to the Deakin University Art Gallery at the Melbourne Burwood campus. The Deakin University Art Gallery has a wide collection of work by Australian artists including the Sydney based artist Rox De Luca.[30] The university's action of offering the campus, including the mansion, provoked public outrage over the potential privatization of what had been public space.[29] In December 2006, the three-mansion was sold for $33 million to a joint venture between Hamton Property Group and Industry Superannuation Property Trust.[31]

The university's largest campus is in Burwood (37°50′52″S 145°06′51″E﻿ / ﻿37.8479°S 145.1143°E﻿ / -37.8479; 145.1143﻿ (Deakin University, Melbourne Campus)), about 45 minutes by tram (route 75) from the Melbourne CBD. Located alongside Gardiner's Creek parklands between Elgar Road on the north-west border and Mount Scopus Memorial College on the east border. The campus has around 31,975 (2020) undergraduate and postgraduate on-campus students. A recent addition to the Burwood campus in 2021 was the law building, designed by Australian architecture firm Woods Bagot.[32] This building was awarded first place, gold at the 2022 WAN Awards.[33]

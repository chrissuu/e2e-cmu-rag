The article claims that CMU created the first computer-science department in the US. However, this claim seems incorrect; the CMU Computer Science Department was established in 1965, according to the page Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, after the Purdue CS department was established in 1962.[1] Thatsme314 (talk) 22:03, 9 November 2023 (UTC)[reply]

Various IP addresses have been warring to exclude criticism of the Qatari campus from the article.  While some of this criticism is surely due, I think what is there may be a little overwrought.  I think we should follow the Washington Post more closely, which presents a nuanced picture.  Gulf News gives space to a minor Qatar critic.  The HuffPost article is WP:RSOPINION.  Disclosing that I worked for another educational institution in Qatar for a time.  Russ Woodroofe (talk) 07:26, 18 June 2024 (UTC)[reply]

The University of New England (UNE) is a public university in the New England region of the state of New South Wales, Australia. Founded in 1938, it was the first Australian university to be established outside of a state capital.[11] Its main campus is located in the regional city of Armidale mid-way between Sydney and Brisbane.[12] As of 2021, the university had approximately 26,000 students.[13]

In the 2019 Student Experience Survey, UNE recorded the sixth-highest student satisfaction rating out of all Australian universities, and the highest student satisfaction rating out of all public universities in New South Wales, with an overall satisfaction rating of 83.2.[14][15] The university ranks lower in research-based rankings of Australian universities.[16]

Calls for tertiary education to be extended outside of Sydney began in earnest after World War I. Local MP David Drummond led a delegation to the state government in the early 1920s lobbying for a university college in Armidale.[17] A 1924 New South Wales royal commission, chaired by John Jacob Cohen, recommended that consideration be given to a rural university and the Armidale Teachers' College was established in 1928. An organised push to establish a university in New England began in the early 1930s, at the height of the New England statehood movement which sought separation of the region from New South Wales and its admission as a new Australian state. Prominent early advocates in addition to Drummond included Colin Sinclair, Earle Page, and Victor Thompson.[18]

A provisional council to raise funds for a university in New England was established in 1934. The New England University College was established in Armidale in 1938 as a child of the University of Sydney, with Page the chairman of the inaugural advisory council.[19] The college became fully independent as the University of New England in 1954, after the entry into force of the University of New England Act 1953 (NSW). The university established a faculty of education in 1967.[citation needed]

The university underwent a major restructuring in 1989 with the University of New England Act 1989 (NSW), transitioning into a network university with multiple locations. These consisted of a campus at Armidale, which incorporated the former University of New England and the Armidale College of Advanced Education; and a campus at Lismore, incorporating the former Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education.[citation needed]

In 1990, the Orange Agricultural College joined the university. The network also included the UNE-Coffs Harbour Centre, which provided courses from within academic departments of the Armidale and Lismore campuses.[20]

In November 1993, the University of New England was re-formed once again, with the passage of the University of New England Act 1993 (NSW) and the Southern Cross University Act 1993 (NSW) through the New South Wales Parliament. This legislation had the effect of dismantling the network university. The University of New England from 1994 has only one campus, at Armidale. A new university (Southern Cross University) was created with campuses in Lismore and Coffs Harbour; the Orange campus was amalgamated with the University of Sydney.[citation needed]

The amalgamation of the former Armidale College of Advanced Education was complete by the time of the new legislation. In the same year, a law school was established.[citation needed]

In 2020, the University of New England was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Early in the year, the university became a potential exposure site, and students and faculty underwent viral tests.[21] In September of that year, a staff restructuring was announced, with the goal of saving $20 million annually in wage costs and preparing the university for future opportunities, at the expense of 100 positions.[22]

The University of New England is on several sites in Armidale. The northern campus is five kilometres to the northwest of the city centre, in a rural and bushland setting. Part of this campus includes the original property presented by T R Forster to the University of Sydney for the establishment of a University College. This property comprised the old homestead, 'Booloominbah', with several other buildings and 74 hectares of land. Since the original gift, other benefactors have presented properties to the university, whose Armidale site now comprises some 260 hectares.[23]

Booloominbah and the vice-chancellor's residence Trevenna were designed by architect John Horbury Hunt.

The Newling campus of the university includes the Newling Centre, home to the New England Conservatorium of Music, and other buildings associated with the former Armidale College of Advanced Education.

The university possesses rural properties close to the campus, providing facilities for teaching and research. In addition, there are the 'Tullimba' rural research property at Kingstown and the Douglas McMaster Rural Research Station at Warialda.[23]

The University of New England has one of the most extensive residential college systems in Australia. Around half of UNE's on campus students live in one of the colleges.[24]

The university has a vibrant metro campus, UNE Sydney, set in a strategic position at the hearth of Parramatta CBD. As stated on their website "The campus is designed to meet the learning and support needs for our predominately online city-based students and on-campus international students in select courses".[25]

In 2020, the university revealed plans to construct a campus in Tamworth by 2031.[26] The university has a study centre in Tamworth and Taree called UNE Tamworth, and UNE Taree, as well as a network of regional study centres in north-west New South Wales and in the New England region.

The current Chancellor is Sarah Pearson,[27] who succeeded James Harris FRSN (2014–2024), who took over the role from John Watkins in 2014.[28] Brigid Heywood succeeded Annabelle Duncan as Vice-Chancellor in July 2019.[29] However, Heywood resigned in August 2022 after criminal charges were laid against her.[30] UNE’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Simon Evans acted in the Vice-Chancellor role until a suitable replacement, Chris Moran, was found in 2023.[31][32]

The research and teaching staff of the University of New England, Australia, is divided into three faculties that together contain nine multi-disciplinary schools.

The university offers over 200 programs[33] in 23 discipline areas.

The field of peace studies has historically been a focus within UNE, commencing in 1982.[34] The University offers majors in peace studies at undergraduate level, as well as research higher degrees in peace studies.[35][36]

UNE undertakes fundamental and applied research in many disciplines. Its scholars and scientists have established international reputations through their contributions in areas such as rural science, agricultural economics, educational administration, linguistics and archaeology. Collaborative research with other institutions includes projects with the CSIRO and the high-profile Cooperative Research Centres. Through its research UNE seeks to assist in the economic, social and cultural advancement of Australia and in the advanced training of undergraduate and postgraduate students.[40]

UNE's principal research flagship is animal genetics and livestock breeding, which is serviced by the Animal Genetics and Breeding Unit (AGBU)[41] and delivered commercially by the Agricultural Business Research Institute (ABRI).

Other research flagships include: Rural Education which is undertaken by the National Centre of Science, Information and Communication Technology, and Mathematics Education for Rural and Regional Australia (SiMERR)[42]
Rural Communities, Landscapes and Practices which is led by the Institute for Rural Futures (IRF).[43]

Other targeted areas of research include:[40]

The Frank Archibald Memorial Lecture Series is named in honour of Frank Archibald, aka "Bubba", an Aboriginal man who was born in Oban, near Guyra,[44] around 1885[45] and died on 18 October 1975, aged an estimated 106 years old. He was the eldest grandson[44] of "King Robert"[45] (aka "King Bobby",[46] "King Malawangi",[47][48][49][50][51] "King Billy" or Robert/Billy/Bobby King), whose photo hangs in the Armidale Museum.[44]

As a revered elder, Archibald could speak seven different Aboriginal languages and understand another two, as well as speaking English. His surname derives from his Scottish father. He was of the Gumbangeri people on his mother's side, but was also initiated into his wife Sarah Morris's people, the Dhungatti nation. A Catholic priest, Father Kelly, helped Archibald to build a house, completed in 1957, in which many relatives came to live. Archibald was revered by the Armidale Koori and community for his knowledge of so many Aboriginal issues, particularly in the education of his people and others.[44]

The Frank Archibald Memorial Lecture was founded by Lynette Riley,[52] with the inaugural lecture given in 1986 by Eric Willmot. Since then, speakers have included:[44]

According to a 2017 Australian Human Rights Commission report based on optional surveys given to students, UNE had the highest reported rate of sexual assaults at universities in Australia, with 4% of respondents saying they had been sexually assaulted; the average rate across all universities was 1.6%.[75][76] Under a previous 2016 freedom of information request UNE had reported there were 22 officially reported cases of sexual assaults on campus over the previous five years, resulting in two expulsions, no suspensions and seven warnings.[77] In February 2017 vice-chancellor Annabelle Duncan said that past UNE policies dealing with sexual harassment did not allow management to handle some cases satisfactorily.[78]

On 1 August 2022, the incumbent Vice-Chancellor, Professor Brigid Heywood, was charged with allegedly assaulting a teenage girl at a club in Armidale on 8 March. Heywood was issued with an attendance notice to appear at Armidale Local Court on 26 September.[79] On 5 August, UNE accepted her resignation.[30]

Monash University (/ˈmɒnæʃ/) is a public research university based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Named after World War I general Sir John Monash, it was founded in 1958 and is the second oldest university in the state. The university has a number of campuses, four of which are in Victoria (Clayton, Caulfield, Peninsula, and Parkville), one in Malaysia and another one in Indonesia. Monash also owns land (3.6 hectares)  in Notting Hill, opposite its Clayton campus.[15] Monash has a research and teaching centre in Prato, Italy, a graduate research school in Mumbai, India and graduate schools in Suzhou, China and Tangerang, Indonesia. Courses are also delivered at other locations, including South Africa.

Monash is home to major research facilities, including the Monash Law School, the Australian Synchrotron, the Monash Science Technology Research and Innovation Precinct (STRIP), the Australian Stem Cell Centre, Victorian College of Pharmacy, and 100 research centres[16] and 17 co-operative research centres. In 2019, its total revenue was over $2.72 billion (AUD), with external research income around $462 million.[17] In 2019, Monash enrolled over 55,000 undergraduate and over 25,000 postgraduate students.[18] It has more applicants than any other university in the state of Victoria.[19]

Monash is a member of Australia's Group of Eight research universities, a member of the ASAIHL, and is the only Australian member of the M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers, Universities and National Academies. Monash is one of the Australian universities to be ranked in the École des Mines de Paris (Mines ParisTech) ranking on the basis of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies.[20]

Established by an Act of Parliament in 1958, the original campus was in the suburb of Clayton where the university was granted an expansive site of 100 hectares of open land.[21] The 100 hectares of land consisted of farmland and included the former Talbot Epileptic Colony.[22] The Tudor-style farmhouse built by the O'Shea family became the original Vice-Chancellor's House — now University House.[23][24][25][26]

From its first intake of 357 students at Clayton on 13 March 1961, the university grew rapidly in size and student numbers so that by 1967 its all-times enrolment reached 21,000 students.[27] In its early years, it offered undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in engineering, medicine, science, arts, economics, politics, education, and law. It was a major provider for international student places under the Colombo Plan, which saw the first Asian students enter the Australian education system.

The university was named after the prominent Australian general Sir John Monash.[28] This was the first time in Australia that a university had been named after a person, rather than a city or state.[29]

From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, Monash became the centre of student radicalism in Australia.[30][31] It was the site of many mass student demonstrations, particularly concerning Australia's role in the Vietnam War and conscription.[32] By the late 1960s, several student organisations, some of which were influenced by or supporters of communism, turned their focus to Vietnam, with numerous blockades and sit-ins.[33] In one extraordinary event that came to be known as the Monash Siege, students forced then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to hide in a basement at the Alexander Theatre, in a major protest over the Whitlam dismissal.[34]

In the late 1970s and 1980s, some of Monash's most publicised research came through its pioneering of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Led by Carl Wood and Alan Trounson, the Monash IVF Program achieved the world's first clinical IVF pregnancy in 1973.[35] In 1980, they delivered the first IVF baby in Australia.[36] This eventually became a massive source of revenue for the university at a time when university funding in Australia was beginning to slow down.

In the late 1980s, the Dawkins Reforms changed the landscape of higher education in Australia. Under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor Mal Logan, Monash transformed dramatically. In 1988, Monash University had only one campus in Clayton, with around 15,000 students.[37] Just over a decade later, it had 8 campuses (including 2 overseas), a European research and teaching centre, and more than 50,000 students, making it the largest and most internationalised Australian university.[38]

Expansion of the university began in 1990 with a series of mergers between Monash, the Chisholm Institute of Technology, and the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. In 1991 a merger with the Victorian College of Pharmacy created a new faculty of the university. This continued in 1994, with the establishment of the Berwick campus.[39]

In 1998, the university opened the Malaysia campus, its first overseas campus and the first foreign university in Malaysia. In 2001, Monash South Africa opened its doors in Johannesburg, making Monash the first foreign university in South Africa. The same year, the university secured an 18th-century Tuscan palace to open a research and teaching centre in Prato, Italy.

At the same time, Australian universities faced unprecedented demand for international student places, which Monash met on a larger scale than most. Today, around 30% of its students are from outside Australia.[40] Monash students come from over 100 countries, and speak over 90 different languages. The increase in international students, combined with the university's expansion, meant that Monash's income greatly increased throughout the 1990s, and it is now one of Australia's top 200 exporters.[41]

In recent years, the university has been prominent in medical research. A highlight of this came in 2000, when Alan Trounson led the team of scientists which announced to the world that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells, a discovery which led to a dramatic increase in interest in the potential of stem cells.[42] It has also led to Monash being ranked in the top 20 universities in the world for biomedicine.[43]

On 21 October 2002, Huan Yun "Allen" Xiang, shot two people dead and injured five others on the Clayton campus.[44]

Since December 2011, Monash has had a global alliance with the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom.[45]

In 2014, the university ceded its Gippsland campus to Federation University.[46] On 15 July 2016, Monash confirmed that Federation University Australia would take over the operations of the Berwick campus prior to the end of 2018.[47]

In 2019, the university sold its Monash South Africa campus to Advtech. Students who were on schedule to complete their degree on time would still receive a degree from Monash University after the sale. The reason for the sale was reported to be low profitability and low enrolment numbers.[48] Prior to the sale, Monash University had sidelined the South African campus on its official websites and did not refer to it as a 'campus' unlike Monash Malaysia.

Monash announced its second Southeast Asian expansion in Indonesia as it officially obtained its operational license from the Ministry of Education and Culture on 1 December 2020. The university plans to open its campus doors in October 2021, located in BSD City, Tangerang, Banten. Unlike Monash Malaysia, Monash Indonesia will focus on graduate studies including hosting the Institute for Advanced Research, supported by the Indonesian Scholarship and Research Support Foundation.[49][50][51][52]

In August 2025, Monash University law lecturer Alan Boulton was charged with offences relating to child exploitation material. According to ABC News and The Age, the university suspended the lecturer following a police investigation and stated that it was cooperating with authorities. The case remains before the courts.[53][54]

The Clayton campus covers an area over 1.1 km2 and is the largest of the Monash campuses. Clayton is the flagship campus for Monash, demanding higher ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) scores than all the other campuses, with the exception of Parkville. Clayton is home to the faculties of Arts, Business & Economics, Education, Engineering, Information Technology, Law, Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, and Science. The Clayton campus has its own suburb and postcode (3800).

Various major scientific research facilities are located on or adjacent to the campus. Chief among these are the Australian Synchrotron[55] and CSIRO.

The campus is also home to numerous restaurants and retail outlets, as well as student bars: Sir John's (located in the Campus Centre) and the Notting Hill Hotel (located down the street, founded in 1891),[56] both of which are hubs of social life on the campus.[57]

The campus is also home to a number of halls of residence, colleges and other on-campus accommodations that house several thousand students. Six halls of residence are located at the Clayton campus in Clayton, Victoria. There is an additional private residential college affiliated with the university. The Clayton campus contains the Robert Blackwood Hall, named after the university's founding chancellor Sir Robert Blackwood and designed by Sir Roy Grounds.[58]

The Caulfield campus is Monash University's second-largest. Its multifaceted nature is reflected in the range of programs it offers through the faculties of Arts, Art Design & Architecture (MADA), Business & Economics, and Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences. A major building program has been announced to expand teaching facilities, provide student accommodation, and redevelop the shopping centre.

Located in The Alfred Hospital, Monash University's Alfred campus houses the Central Clinical School[59] and the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine,[60] which contains the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine[61] and the Department of Forensic Medicine.[62]

The Parkville campus is located on Royal Parade in the Melbourne suburb of Parkville, around 2 km north of the Melbourne CBD. The campus is home to the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The faculty specialises in pharmacy practice, pharmaceutical and formulation science, and medicinal chemistry. The campus offers Australia's first combined, 5-year Bachelor of Pharmacy/Master of Pharmacy program, leading to registration as a pharmacist after successful completion of a supervised internship and registration exams in the final year. The Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Science replaced the Bachelor of Formulation Science in 2007 and the Bachelor of Medicinal Chemistry in 2008. High achieving students may enrol in a double degree, combining a Bachelor of Engineering and a Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Science. The campus also offers postgraduate degrees, including the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Clinical Pharmacy.

Considered a world-class faculty, it was ranked first in the world in pharmacy and pharmacology in the 2022 QS World University Rankings by Subject, surpassing Harvard University and the University of Oxford, which ranked second and third, respectively.[63]

The Peninsula campus has a teaching and research focus on health and wellbeing, and is a hub of undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Nursing, Health Science, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and Psychology — and particularly in Emergency Health (Paramedic) courses.

The campus is located in the bayside suburb of Frankston on the edge of Melbourne.

The Peninsula campus also offers a range of courses including those from its historic roots with early childhood and primary education (during the 1960s and 1970s, the campus was the State Teachers' College), and Business & Economics (since the merger of the State Teachers' College with the Caulfield Institute of Technology to create the Chisholm Institute of Technology in 1982). The campus was also home to the Peninsula School of Information Technology, which in 2006 was wound back with Information Technology units previously offered being relocated to the Caulfield campus.

The centrally located Monash Law City Campus houses the postgraduate Faculty of Law. It provides teaching for the Monash Law Masters and JD programmes. This campus is well placed within Melbourne's legal precinct, allowing students to have easy access to the surrounding courts.

The Monash University Malaysia campus opened in 1998 in Bandar Sunway, Selangor, Malaysia. The Sunway campus offers various undergraduate degrees through its faculties of Arts and Social Sciences, Business, Engineering, Information Technology, Medicine and Health Sciences, Pharmacy and Science. It is currently home to over 8,489 (2018)[64] students.
The new purpose-built campus opened in 2007, providing a high-tech home for Monash in Malaysia. In addition to a wide range of undergraduate degrees, the campus also offers both postgraduate Masters and PhD programs. Its degrees in Medicine and Surgery are the first medical degrees outside Australia and New Zealand to be accredited by the Australian Medical Council.[65]

The Monash University Prato Centre is located in the 18th-century palace, Palazzo Vaj, in the historic centre of Prato, a city near Florence in Italy. Primarily, it hosts staff and students from Monash's other campuses for semesters in Law, Art Design & Architecture, History, Music, and Criminology as well as various international conferences. It was officially opened on 17 September 2001 as part of the university's vigorous internationalisation policy.[66]

The IITB-Monash Research Academy opened in 2008 and is situated in Mumbai, India.[67] It is a partnership between Monash and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. It aims to carry out high impact research in engineering and sciences, particularly clean energy, biotechnology and nanotechnology. Students undertake their research in both India and Australia, with supervisors from both Monash and IITB. Upon graduating, they receive a dual PhD from the two institutions.[68] In the month following its official opening, 36 joint projects had commenced, with a further several hundred planned.

In August 2015, Christopher Pyne, Australian Minister for Education and Training, officially opened the new Monash-IITB Research Academy Building in Mumbai, India.[69]

In 2012, it was announced that Monash had won a licence to develop a joint graduate school with Southeast University (Nanjing) in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province.[70] The Southeast University-Monash University Joint Graduate School is the first Australian university, and the third foreign university, to win a licence to operate in China.[71] The school offers master's degrees and PhDs in science and engineering, with an initial cohort of 500 students, building up to 2000 in the years to come.[72]

The Monash University, Indonesia, opened its doors in October 2021, focusing on postgraduate programs offering master's degree and PhDs. Currently the campus offers several Master's degree programs including: Data Science, Cybersecurity, Urban Design, Business Innovation, Public Policy & Management, Marketing & Digital Communications, Public Health, and Sustainability. The campus is located in BSD City, Tangerang, Banten.[73]

The campus plans to expand to undergraduate courses from July 2026, with bachelor degrees in design, digital business, and information technology.[74]

As part of the university's expansion in the 1990s, Monash took over the operations of the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education in 1990.[citation needed]

The Gippsland campus provided courses via distance education. However, between 2005 and 2010, many of these programs were transferred to city campuses, thus losing their appeal to regional areas.[citation needed]  At its peak enrolment in 2007, the campus was home to 2,000 on-campus students, 5,000 off-campus students and nearly 400 staff.[citation needed]  The campus was located in the Latrobe Valley town of Churchill. Until 2014, it was the only non-metropolitan campus of Monash University.[citation needed]

The Gippsland campus had on-campus accommodation including the self-catering West House and East House.[75]

Ballarat University joined with Monash University's Gippsland campus to form a new regional university known as Federation University Australia from 1 January 2014, so this campus is no longer part of Monash.[76][77]

The former Berwick campus of Monash University was built on the old Casey airfield in the south-eastern growth corridor of Victoria, Australia.  With a presence in the area since 1994, the first Monash Berwick campus building was completed in 1996 and the third building in March 2004. It was situated on a 55-hectare site in the City of Casey, then one of the three fastest growing municipalities in Australia. Monash announced the closure of this campus to staff and students on 7 March 2016. On 15 July 2016 it was announced that Federation University Australia would take responsibility for the Berwick Campus from 2017 pending government approvals.[78] This officially commenced on 1 January 2018, as a campus of Federation University Australia.

In August 2013, Monash University entered a partnership with Laureate International Universities to establish a campus in South Africa.[79][citation needed] This effort was short-lived, and Monash elected to transfer ownership of the campus to the Independent Institute of Education (IIE) South Africa in 2015. The transfer was concluded in 2019.[64]

The vice-chancellor is the chief executive of the university, who is head of Monash's day-to-day activities. The vice-chancellor is also the university president of Monash. (In North America and parts of Europe, the equivalent role is the president or principal.) The chancellor is chair of the university council and provides advice to the vice-chancellor, as well as having ceremonial duties.[citation needed] Council is the governing body of the university, established by the Monash University Act 2009.[80]

Margaret Gardner was named as the vice-chancellor and president on 1 September 2014, the first woman to hold the position.[81] After Gardner was appointed Governor of Victoria in 2023, Susan Elliott AM took over as interim VC, until the appointment of Sharon Pickering in February 2024, as 10th vice-chancellor and president of the university.[82]

Megan Clark AC was appointed chancellor in 2024.[83] Deputy Chancellors are Geraldine Johns-Putra, Peter Young AM KC, and John Simpson AM.[80]

Monash is divided into 10 faculties. These incorporate the university's major departments of teaching and research centres.[84]

The faculties are:

Various other academic organisations exist alongside the faculties and research centres.

Monash University staff produce over 3,000 research publications each year, with research conducted in over 150 fields of study.[17]

Monash is home to over 120 research centres and institutes.[85] Major interdisciplinary research centres include the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute,[86] the Monash University Accident Research Centre, and the Monash Centre for Synchrotron Science. Some notable research centres also located at or affiliated with Monash University include the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute,[87] the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law,[88] the Melbourne Centre for Nanofabrication,[89] and the Monash Institute of Medical Research.[90]

Some of the university's notable research achievements include the world's first IVF pregnancy, the first seatbelt legislation, the discovery of the anti-influenza drug Relenza (Zanamivir), the discovery that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells,[91] and the development of a single-use oral anti-malaria drug.[92]

The Monash Sustainable Development Institute (MSDI) is an interdisciplinary research institute with a focus on sustainable development, that includes researchers from all 10 faculties of the university. As of 2024[update] it comprises more than 150 staff and PhD students, MSDI works with industry and government, civil society, and other academics, and uses the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework to guide its work.[93] MSDI has four centres focusing on specific capabilities:[94]

Monash University Library currently operates several libraries at all of its campuses, spanning over three continents. The library has over 3.2 million items.

Located at the Sir Louis Matheson Library on the Clayton Campus, the Rare Books Collection consists of over 100,000 items, valued because of their age, uniqueness or physical beauty, which can be accessed by Monash staff and students.[99] The collection was started in 1961 when the university librarian purchased original manuscripts by Jonathan Swift and some of his contemporaries. The collection now consists of a range of items including photography, children's books, 15th to 17th-century English and French literature, and original manuscripts and pamphlets. A variety of exhibitions are hosted throughout the year in the Rare Books area.[100]

Located at the university's Clayton Campus, the Manga Library was established in 2002 as a part of the Japanese Studies Centre.[101] The Manga Library houses over 7000 volumes of Japanese manga, spanning a diverse range of genres including Shounen, Shoujo, Seinen, and manga classics. The Manga Library's collection also includes volumes translated into English as well as a selection of bilingual manga. The Manga Library is entirely volunteer-run.

The Monash University Museum of Art (MUMA), since 2010 based on the Caulfield Campus, is the result of an initiative started in 1961, when the inaugural Vice Chancellor Louis Matheson created a fund for the purchase of artworks by then living Australian artists. The establishment of the museum reflected a desire by the university's founders to create the modern Australian university, and to enrich the cultural life of students, staff and visitors.[102]

In 1975, the Monash University Gallery was created in the Menzies Building, moving in 1987 to the Multi-Discipline Centre (later called the Gallery Building).[102]

Its collection had grown to over 1500 works by 2008,[103] including artworks by Arthur Boyd, William Dobell, Sidney Nolan, Howard Arkley, Tracey Moffatt, John Perceval, Fred Williams and Bill Henson. While the gallery's focus is on contemporary Australian art, it houses a number of international works and exhibitions. It hosts regular exhibitions which are open to Monash students and staff, as well as the general public.[104]

As of January 2022[update] the curator is Charlotte Day, while the advisory committee is chaired by Dean Shane Murray and includes Louise Adler and Maudie Palmer AO, founding director of the TarraWarra Museum of Art and Heide Museum of Modern Art.[105]

Known as the Faculty Gallery between 1999 and 2012,[citation needed] the MADA Gallery is a contemporary art gallery located at the university's Caulfield Campus. It is used as a teaching aid for the benefit of the students and staff from the faculty as well as the wider community, and is open to the public. The gallery exhibits solo and group shows by academic and professional staff, local, interstate and international artists and curators, and also hosts artist in residency programs.[106]

The university is also one of three Triple Crown business schools in Australia and possesses accreditation by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, Association of MBAs and EQUIS.

For international students starting in 2025, tuition fees range from A$37,100 to A$92,900 per academic year for award programs lasting at least one year.[107][108] Domestic students[a] may be offered a federally-subsidised Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) which substantially decreases the student contribution amount billed to the student.[110] The maximum student contribution amount limits that can be applied to CSP students are dependent on the field of study.[111]

Since 2021, Commonwealth Supported Places have also been limited to 7 years of equivalent full-time study load (EFTSL), calculated in the form of Student Learning Entitlement (SLE).[112] Students may accrue additional SLE under some circumstances (e.g. starting a separate one-year honours program) or every 10 years.[112] Domestic students are also able to access the HECS-HELP student loans scheme offered by the federal government.[113] These are indexed to the Consumer or Wage Price Index, whichever is lower, and repayments are voluntary unless the recipient passes an income threshold.[113]

The university also offers several scholarships, which come in the form of bursaries or tuition fee remission.[114]

In the 2024 Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities, which measures aggregate performance across the QS, THE and ARWU rankings, the university attained a position of #50 (3rd nationally).[129]

In the Australian Financial Review Best Universities Ranking 2024, the university was ranked #3 amongst Australian universities.[130]

In the 2026 Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings (published 2025), the university attained a tied position of #36 (5th nationally).[131]

In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 (published 2024), the university attained a tied position of #58 (2nd nationally).[132]

In the 2025 Academic Ranking of World Universities, the university attained a position of #76 (4th nationally).[133]

In the 2025–2026 U.S. News & World Report Best Global Universities, the university attained a position of #38 (4th nationally).[134]

In the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2024,[b] the university attained a position of #51 (4th nationally).[135]

The Australian Government's QILT[c] conducts national surveys documenting the student life cycle from enrolment through to employment.[136] These surveys place more emphasis on criteria such as student experience, graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction[136] than perceived reputation, research output and citation counts.[137]

In the 2023 Employer Satisfaction Survey, graduates of the university had an overall employer satisfaction rate of 83.9%.[138]

In the 2023 Graduate Outcomes Survey, graduates of the university had a full-time employment rate of 82% for undergraduates and 87.8% for postgraduates.[139] The initial full-time salary was A$73,000 for undergraduates and A$91,000 for postgraduates.[139]

In the 2023 Student Experience Survey, undergraduates at the university rated the quality of their entire educational experience at 73.1% meanwhile postgraduates rated their overall education experience at 75.6%.[140]

The Good Universities Guide places the Clayton, Caulfield, Parkville, and Peninsula campuses of Monash in the category of universities most difficult to gain admission to in Australia for domestic students, with each campus receiving an Entry Standards mark of 5/5.[141] Monash has the highest demand for places among domestic high school graduates of any Australian university in Victoria.[142] In 2009, one in four applicants put Monash as their first preference.[143] This equates to more than 15,000 first preferences from Victorian high school leavers. Of the top 5% of high school graduates in Victoria, more choose Monash than any other institution. In 2010, almost half of the top 5% of high school leavers chose to attend Monash — the highest of any Victorian university by quite some margin.[144] In 2009, among students with a "perfect" ENTER score of 99.95 (i.e. students in the top 0.05% of high school applicants), 63 made an application for Monash.

Monash College provides students with an alternative point of entry to Monash University.[145] The institution offers pathway studies for students who endeavour to undertake studies at one of the Monash campuses. The college's specialised undergraduate diplomas provide an alternative entry point into more than 60 Monash University bachelor degrees, taught intensively in smaller classes and an environment overall similar to that offered by the university. The college offers programs in several countries throughout the world.[146]

Monash students are represented by student unions in individual campus organisations. Graduate students are represented by the university-wide Monash Graduate Association, while undergraduate students are represented by:

Monash students are also represented by academic associations and societies. These groups organise social events and represent student interests to the faculty among other goals.

Apart from the representative organisations, Monash has numerous other interest-based clubs and societies. Some notable student organisations include:

Sport at Monash University is overseen by Monash Sport, a department of the university which employs over 200 staff.[148] Currently, there are over 50 sporting clubs at the university.[149] The Monash Blues, which competes in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA), plays its home games at Frearson Oval at the Clayton campus.

Each campus has a range of sporting facilities used by students and staff, including football, cricket, hockey, soccer, rugby and baseball fields; tennis, squash and badminton courts; gyms and swimming pools. The university also had an alpine lodge at Mount Buller until the end of 2011.

Monash's sporting teams compete in a range of local and national competitions. Monash sends the largest number of students of any Australian university to the Australian University Games, in which it was Overall Champion in 2008 and 2009.[150]

Facilities at Monash are often used by a range of professional sporting teams. For example, the Australia national association football team, the Socceroos, used the Clayton campus and trained on-site in South Africa for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Monash Residential Services (MRS) is responsible for co-ordinating the operation of on-campus halls of residence.[151] MRS manages a variety of facilities on campus at Clayton and Peninsula:

Mannix College, founded in 1969 and owned by the Catholic Church, was originally an all-male college administered by the Dominican order. It is named after Daniel Mannix (1864–1963), who was the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne. Mannix is affiliated with the university, and located opposite the southern end of the Clayton campus.[152]

The Newman Lecture series is an annual public lecture series held at Mannix College. It is named after Cardinal John Henry Newman and began in 1981.[153][154][Note 2][155][156] The inaugural lecture was given by Bishop Eric D'Arcy, and others by Sir Edward Dunlop, Robyn Williams, Michael Tate, Max Charlesworth, and Veronica Brady. In both 2006 and 2007, the lecture was presented as a play, both relating to the life of Daniel Mannix.[157] The 2009 lecture, delivered by Gabrielle McMullen, celebrated 40 years of Mannix College.[158]

Marist College, founded by the Marist order, was established in November 1969 as a traditional all-male college, with an attached seminary.[159] Marist College had closed by 1978, the university subsequently purchasing the college and naming it Normanby House.[160] Normanby House had closed its doors (demolished) by early 2025 to "make way"  for the Suburban Rail Loop project.[161]

In 2013, Monash University introduced non-residential colleges.[further explanation needed] There are now eight colleges: Orion, Centaurus and Ursa (Clayton campus); Pegasus, Phoenix and Auriga (Caulfield campus); Aquila (Peninsula campus); and Lupa (Caulfield and Parkville campuses).[162]

There are 1,100 Monash graduates (or 8.33% of the total biographical listings) listed among the 13,200 biographies of Australia's most notable individuals in the 2008 edition of Who's Who in Australia. Likewise, 10% of Australia's top 50 CEOs completed their undergraduate degree at Monash.[163]

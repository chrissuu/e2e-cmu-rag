Federation University Australia (FedUni) is a public university based in Victoria, Australia.[9] It is the modern descendant of the School of Mines Ballarat, established in 1870 as the fourth tertiary institution in Australia, which evolved to form the modern university as it is today.[10] Formerly known as the University of Ballarat, it changed its name to Federation University in 2014 as it became a multi-campus institution with a strong presence both in Ballarat and across the state.[11][12]

The university is a dual-sector institution that provides both higher and vocational education. It offers study programs in healthcare, education, computational science, engineering and various other fields including commerce, the arts and sciences. It also offers technical and further education (TAFE), a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and other research programs.[13]

The university has a multi-campus presence in and around Ballarat, including the old School of Mines campus which is notable for its red brick buildings, and also has campuses in Berwick (Melbourne) and Horsham (Wimmera).[14] In 2013, the university merged with Monash University's former Gippsland campus in Churchill, an amalgamation that was followed by its renaming to Federation University.[11][12]

Tertiary education at Ballarat began in 1870, making it Australia's fourth oldest tertiary institution.[15]

On 6 September 2013, the Victorian Parliament passed legislation to establish Federation University Australia.[16] The name change officially began in 2014. The then Vice-Chancellor justified the name change as an attempt to broaden the reach of the university nationally and internationally, and in fairness to the campuses outside Ballarat. Other names considered were Eureka University, Robert Menzies University, and Vida Goldstein University and several others, before narrowing down the choice  to two names: State University of Victoria or Federation University Australia. After consultation with the community and over 100 stakeholders, the present name was decided upon.[17]

In addition to the following campuses, the university also had joint-degree programmes with international colleges, including PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College in Hong Kong.

The former Ballarat Gaol, a maximum security prison that operated from 1862 until 1965, was located on the site of the university's School of Mines (SMB) campus, at the southern end of Lydiard Street. The area is known for being a well preserved Victorian era street.[18] While the prison was mostly demolished in the 1960s, the old prison walls, gate and guard towers, as well as the residences of the governor and warden, still exist. One of the bedrooms was used by Bella Guerin, who in 1883 became the first woman to graduate from an Australian university.[19] The campus also includes the old School of Mines buildings.

Located in Mt Helen, 10 km south of Ballarat. The university's largest campus, it has three residences, Peter Lalor South Hall, Peter Lalor North Hall, and Bella Guerin Hall. Its programs include the Institute of Education, Arts and Community; Institute of Health and Wellbeing: Institute of Innovation, Science and Sustainability.

The Gippsland Campus is located in the township of Churchill in the foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges. The campus is home to over 2,500 students and approximately 400 staff.[citation needed]

The campus was formerly Monash University, Gippsland Campus, but became part of Federation University Australia on 1 January 2014.

The Berwick Campus is located 40 km (25 mi) south-east of the Melbourne city centre. It transitioned itself from the Monash University, Berwick campus in 2017 and completed its transition in early 2018. The exact location of the building is 100 Clyde Road, Berwick. The university has four buildings named 901, 902, 903, and 930 as well as additional buildings for on-campus living. Nursing has the highest enrolment rate at the Berwick Campus, with a focus also on education courses, IT, and psychology.

The Brisbane Campus, situated in the centre of Brisbane city, offers a range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs in information technology, business and allied health.[20]

The university has a technology park with the mission to facilitate the development of technology-based companies or companies that benefit from the technological resources of the university. The following organisations operate in the park.

More than 1350 people are employed by tenants at the technology park and approximately half of those holding Federation University Australia qualifications. In 2008, IBM announced that it would expand its workforce with the construction of a new $10 million building on the park.[21]

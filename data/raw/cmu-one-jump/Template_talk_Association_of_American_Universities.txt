can we kill the leading <br/> and the trailing newline? —ptk✰fgs 02:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)[reply]

I changed Washington U to Washington University because the above abreviation is not at all current. If it must be abreviated, at least change it to Wash. U. or WUSTL or something still in use. caz | speak 22:54, 5 March 2007 (UTC)[reply]

Many of the schools listed here have multiple campuses, all of which could technically be called simply by their state's name. However, we're trying to keep the list as tidy as possible. When there is clearly a flagship campus of the system, it should be sufficient to label it simply by its state name. Ask yourself this: When someone says University of North Carolina, which campus do you think they're talking about? Maybe you're trying to show respect for the rest of the system, but Wikipedia strives to serve as broad of an audience as possible. On a national level, UNC is Chapel Hill.—Lazytiger 17:58, 5 April 2007 (UTC)[reply]

I've changed the displayed name for the University of California at Los Angeles.  No one, and I mean no one refers to that college in general usage as "UC Los Angeles."  Most UCLA students would take a moment to realize the term referred to their alma mater.  UCLA is alone among the UCs in being known by only its full name or its full acronym, and nothing in between.

As nice as it would be make the template more compact with shortened names, any use of so called flagships it surely contradicts WP:NPOV.  See Talk:University_of_North_Carolina for some background and some of the other talk pages of similar schools for other discussions.  Unfortunately, the use by the NCAA of such names confuses things, but that dates back to before many of the systems were introduced.65.190.205.109 (talk) 20:56, 6 April 2008 (UTC)[reply]

Hello,

I would like for the newest members of the AAU to be added to this list. Including Dartmouth College, University of California, Santa Cruz, and University of Utah. If someone else with authority could do that, it would be greatly appreciated!

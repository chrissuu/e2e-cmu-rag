Economic diversity or economic diversification refers to variations in the economic status or the use of a broad range of economic activities in a region or country.[1] Diversification is used as a strategy to encourage positive economic growth and development.[2] Research shows that more diversified economies are associated with higher levels of gross domestic product.[3]

Good examples of national economy diversification are Chile, Malaysia and Brazil.[4]

The City of Pittsburgh has a ban on plastic bags. Learn more All 4 CitiParks Farmers Markets accept food stamps (SNAP), credit and debit cards as part of Just Harvest's Fresh Access program.

Shoppers with SNAP benefits can get fresh, nutritious and local-grown food, including produce, meat, dairy, bread and baked goods, produce plants, seeds and honey. (Hot prepared food items, alcohol and non-food items are not eligible for SNAP purchases.) Food Bucks give Fresh Access food stamp shoppers extra money to spend on fruits and veggies. For every $5 spent in food stamps, receive an extra $2 to spend on produce. For 2025 Market Season, Just Harvest will add another $3 to this thanks to a generous grant from the Food Justice Fundâ€”thus doubling SNAP Benefits at all CitiParks Farmers Markets in the 2025 Season.

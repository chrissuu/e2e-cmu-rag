In This Section Oliver Bath House Film & Event Management You do not need swimming skills to enjoy our spray parks. Spray parks are accessible to the tiniest toddler to a pre-teen adventurer, and even those using wheelchairs.

Let your imagination run wild, as sensors cause sprayers to magically turn on and off in this three-dimensional world of water. It's guaranteed to bring back memories of running through sprinklers, but this time with a lot more fun, color and movement.

Spray Parks will remain open through (weather permitting).

10 AM to 8 PM Daily Note: The Beechview Spray Park is closed until further notice. This closure is due to a mechanical issue. Stay tuned for updates.

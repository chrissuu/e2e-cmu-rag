In This Section 2025 Governing Agenda Letters of Support Forms My Brother's Keeper Key Focus Areas Pittsburgh Innovation Team Boards, Authorities, Commissions Finance & Budget Pittsburgh Innovation Team Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities (BASC) is a three-year initiative to turbocharge 25 U.S. citiesâ€™ efforts to proactively build cleaner, more resilient, and economically thriving communities. The initiative aims to enhance the work already being done by climate-forward mayors across the U.S. by providing support for cities to design climate programs that fully seize the historic opportunity to access and implement federal funds to advance transformative changes.

Data shows that major sources of harmful pollution are disproportionately located in Black and People of Color communities living on low incomes. Through Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities, innovation teams will focus on building relationships in these communities and work alongside them to advance innovative projects that provide cleaner air, improved public health, a stronger economy with clean energy jobs, and the promise of a more equitable, sustainable future.

Elliott Williams, Innovation Team Civic Designer, will lead this work in Pittsburgh.

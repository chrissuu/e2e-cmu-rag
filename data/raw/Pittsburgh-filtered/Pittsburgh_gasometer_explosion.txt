The Pittsburgh gasometer explosion, or Equitable Gas explosion, was an accident that took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the morning of November 14, 1927.[1]

A huge cylindrical gasometer, the largest in the world at that time at 5 million cubic feet (140,000 m3), developed a leak, and repairmen were sent to fix it. The exact cause of the explosion is not known, but some of those repairing the leak were using acetylene torches.[2]

There was a loud explosion, and three gasometers at the site exploded.[2] A "dense mass of dust and smoke" rose from the ruins before igniting into a ball of fire reported as 100 feet in diameter, which rose further before burning out at a height of 1000 feet.[1] Most buildings within a radius of half a mile were damaged, with windows being broken a mile away,[1] causing upwards of $4 million worth of damage.[2]

It was reported that the explosion "caused lofty downtown skyscrapers to tremble and sway as if hit by an earthquake".[2] 28 people were killed and hundreds were injured.[1]

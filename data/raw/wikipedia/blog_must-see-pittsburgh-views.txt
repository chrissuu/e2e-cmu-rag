A view that doesn't get as much attention as some of the others on this list, but is equally as beautiful, is the one from Grandview Park. Located on Bailey Avenue in Pittsburgh's Allentown neighborhood, this vantage point gives you a view of the city, CONSOL Energy Center, home of the Pittsburgh Penguins, and the South Side Flats. In the distance you can even see the Cathedral of Learning on Pitt's campus.
The Lower Hill District
The Lower Hill District , the area of the former Civic Arena, gives breathtaking views of the city skyline. When the old arena was planned, one of the concepts of the design was a retracting roof to enable spectacular views. When the roof was open, it provided a dramatic view of the Pittsburgh skyline, then dominated by the Gulf and Kopper's Buildings. When the arena first opened with its original tenant (the Pittsburgh Civic Light Orchestra) on Jul 4 1962, Carol Burnett put on one of the opening shows for the arena. She joked about the then-new facility, saying "It'll be a pretty nice place when they get the roof fixed." Future performers, including Leonard Bernstein, were harsher critics of having the roof open, and this novelty would eventually fall out of favor at the arena. While the arena is now long gone, the spectacular views of the skyline remain.

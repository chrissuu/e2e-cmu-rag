Civil & Environmental Engineering
As a civil or environmental engineer, you’ll apply science, technology, social science and communication skills to develop sustainable solutions for the needs of today’s world. Civil engineers plan, design and maintain the infrastructure of society — buildings and airports, tunnels and bridges, and water supply and waste management systems. Environmental engineers protect public health and the environment through improving water, energy and food systems and creating efficient, healthy and resilient cities.
Beyond devising and managing engineered and coupled engineered-natural infrastructure, civil and environmental engineers provide leadership on technical and societal issues like renewable energy, climate change adaptation, smart transportation systems and sustainable development. You’ll develop the strong communication skills needed to navigate complex projects, lead diverse teams and interact with those involved — public officials, company leaders, government officials and community members.

Don’t keep your suicidal feelings to yourself. Talking to someone can help decrease the intensity of your feelings in the moment and they can help you formulate a plan to be safe.
All feelings move through us in waves – they come and go. Please remember that you might be feeling very different in a few hours or days. If you struggle with thoughts of suicide regularly and feel nothing will help, please remember that it is always possible to find a way through our most painful feelings.
Try to distance yourself from your suicidal thoughts in the moment by turning to positive, nourishing activities. Any activity can help. Talking to someone you trust, taking a walk, writing/journaling, playing video games, praying or being spiritual, meditating. Working to make sense of and address the suicidal feelings and thoughts should happen at a time when you are feeling safe.
Remove any objects in your environment that can harm you – ask someone you trust to help.
Refrain from alcohol and drug use.

It's delicious. It's a great deal. And it's one of the marquee events of every summer in Pittsburgh!
Pittsburgh Restaurant Week is a seven day feast with special menus from top restaurants going from Aug. 12-18, 2024, throughout the city. If you've never participated, this event is a fantastic time to try a new restaurant or return to an old favorite, with special menus available only for that week all at a discounted price.
For 2024, they're offering an extra weekend of these special menus Aug. 9-11 and focusing on outdoor seating to pair your meal with beautiful city views.

Take the appropriate standardized tests — if you’re planning to submit scores . Review the standardized testing requirements and recommendations for any colleges you’re considering. Some schools require test scores while others are test-optional or test-blind. Both the College Board (SAT) and the ACT offer fee waivers if you’re concerned about the costs of taking these exams.
Begin your college applications, making note of application and financial aid deadlines . For each college you’re applying to, decide which application plan you’d like to utilize (Early Decision, Early Action or Regular Decision) and review application requirements. Communicate with your school counselor to make sure that your transcript and letters of recommendation are submitted to all colleges to which you are applying.
Continue attending online or in-person college visits . Many schools will also offer evening or weekend sessions in your local area as well.
Apply for financial aid . Complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Some colleges, such as Carnegie Mellon, require you to submit a CSS Profile in addition to the FAFSA.
Plan to attend an admitted student program for colleges that offer you admission. College visits held specifically for admitted students can be different from visits held at other times of the year.
Make note of deposit deadlines . Each school you’re admitted to will set their own deposit deadline, although for many schools, this date is May 1. You must notify a college of your intention to enroll, usually by submitting a monetary deposit for your first semester’s tuition.

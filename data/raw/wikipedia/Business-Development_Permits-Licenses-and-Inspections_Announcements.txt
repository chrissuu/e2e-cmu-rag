Building & Development Application Posted on: 06/13/2024
The OneStopPGH Team is excited to announce the new Building & Development Application! Beginning June 12th, 2024 the Building & Development Application will replace the current Zoning Development Review Application and Building Permit Application. This streamlined application consolidates the building permit and zoning application into a single, unified application. If you're planning a construction project, this will typically be your initial step. After you submit the application, we will inform you of any additional permits required to complete your project.
Some of the important benefits of the new Building & Development Application (BDA) include:
An application that requires no expertise in the construction process! This application uses simplified prompts that ask only for information relevant to your project.
Inter-agency review and coordination! Every BDA will be reviewed by each of the relevant departments. The departments will determine what is required for your project and will inform you of any additional required permits.
Co-applicants! The ability to add multiple applicants to your application so that anyone can respond to requests for more information or provide revisions.
No more Zoning Development Review (ZDR) Application! The reviews associated with the ZDR are now incorporated into the BDA to remove the need for you to apply twice for the same scope.

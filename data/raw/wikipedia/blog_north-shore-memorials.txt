This stunning statue to America's Favorite Neighbor, Fred Rogers, was unveiled on Nov. 5, 2009. The 7,000 pound bronze statue of Mister Rogers is the focal point, seated in his signature pose and gazing out at his neighborhood, the Pittsburgh skyline where he spent his life educating and listening to children. He's framed by a keyhole-like design of the repurposed Manchester Bridge pier (we'll see another relic of this later on this tour)
It's always nice to linger here for a moment, as 29 of Fred Roger's compositions play throughout the day, allowing for a quick escape into the Neighborhood of Make Believe or just a nice reaffirmation that you are special!

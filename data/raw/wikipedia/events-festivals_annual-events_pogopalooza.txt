The grand finale starts at 3 PM with the Big Air Finals, where the weekend’s best competitors go all-in for the title of Best Pogoer in the World. With only 60 seconds per run, every flip, twist, and trick counts. At 5 PM, it’s time for the jaw-dropping Best Trick, where athletes battle the clock to land tricks the world has never seen. Then, at 5:30 PM, it’s the Kids 15 and Under Bounce Off, a free event for young jumpers to see who can pogo the longest and win a brand-new Vurtego Slingshot Kids pogo stick!

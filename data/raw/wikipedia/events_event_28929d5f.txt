Hidden History Trivia Night
Oct 16, 2025 - Oct 16, 2025
Heinz History Center 1212 Smallman Street Pittsburgh, PA 15222
Summon your team and put your knowledge of creepy pop culture and haunted Pittsburgh history to the test during a special Halloween edition of Hidden History Trivia Night.
From eerie Pittsburgh tales to classic horror flicks, trivia night will bewitch your mind, lift your spirits, and maybe even awaken a ghost or two within the museum’s walls.
Raise a glass at the cash bar, enjoy frightful free snacks, and wander through the Pittsburgh’s Hidden History exhibition before trivia begins — because you never know which haunted fact might come back to test you.
Doors open at 6 p.m., so arrive early to grab a drink and claim your spot. Gather a team of up to ten people and prepare for a frightfully fun evening.

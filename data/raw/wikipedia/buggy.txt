"What's Buggy?" you ask.
It is the quintessential interdisciplinary sport and it's one of Carnegie Mellon University's longest held traditions.
This annual student-led relay race, officially known as "Sweepstakes," partners designers, engineers, mechanics and athletes. Together, these brilliant, quirky, creative minds produce a buggy — an aerodynamic vehicle with no engine. It's powered by brains and brawn alone.
In just over two minutes, teams of power-pushing men and women race around a .84 mile track with buggy and driver leading the way around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill, with speeds up to 40 mph.
Every April during Spring Carnival, students, alumni and community fans watch Buggy teams compete for the annual title.
The Teams
Each team has six members: five pushers and a driver. Behind the scenes, designers, engineers and mechanics join forces to craft a racing machine and a work of art. The best of the best vie for a spot in the finals.
The Legacy
The Buggy has evolved over the last century — in shape, size, weight and material. From punchy machine names to secret Buggy shops, Sweepstakes has a language all its own.

There will be no walkup tours on Sundays or days of a weekday/Saturday game. There will also be no tours in the event of special ballpark activities (such as concerts, festivals, etc.).
Daily tour highlights may include:
Warning Track, Bullpens, Popâ€™s Plaza, Pittsburgh Baseball Club Level, Premium Suites and Press Box, Batting Cages, and Dugouts. Out of an abundance of caution, the Pirates Clubhouse will not be included on the tour to prioritize safety for the players and staff, at this time. All areas are subject to change without notice.
PNC Park is now cashless therefore we only accept credit cards, debit cards or gift cards (gift cards will only be accepted for tour ticket purchases.)

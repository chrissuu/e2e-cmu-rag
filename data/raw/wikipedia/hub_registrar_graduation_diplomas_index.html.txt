About Paper Diplomas
A Carnegie Mellon University diploma is a student's certificate of accomplishment. Housed in a burgundy case and marked with a gold seal, the diploma is 14 x 17 inches and is printed with the student’s name, along with their primary degree (e.g., Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering), any additional majors, and any university honors. Minors are not listed on the diploma although they are indicated on the official transcript. To approve their diploma information prior to graduation, students should sign onto SIO, and under the Academic Info tab, click on Graduation and Diploma.
About Certified Electronic Diplomas
A Certified Electronic Diploma (CeDiploma) is a secure electronic document that is simple to share with friends, family, and future employers. They are official, easily verifiable proof of a student's CMU education. Alumni and students who graduated after 2016 receive free CeDiplomas automatically alongside their paper diplomas (no order or reservation is needed). Alumni who graduated prior to 2016 or who have had a name change are eligible to order a CeDiploma at their own cost.
Ordering a Replacement Diploma
Alumni have the option to purchase additional copies or replacements of their original diploma. When placing an order, students who graduated after 1990 should provide their Andrew ID in the “Student ID” field. All paper diplomas arrive in a folder. Diploma presentation covers are not included in replacement reorders and are not available for purchase. Please allow approximately 4-6 weeks for processing and delivery. Based on the recommendation of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, duplicate or replacement diplomas are printed using the current Chairman of Trustees and University President signatures.

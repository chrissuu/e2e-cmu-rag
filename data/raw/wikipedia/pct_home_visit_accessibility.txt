The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust believes the arts are for all. The Trust strives to make the Cultural District’s galleries, theaters, and public spaces welcoming, accessible and inclusive for audiences of all abilities. Requests for services can be granted two weeks in advance of performances.
All Cultural District performance spaces and galleries are accessible and include a variety of features to enhance your experience. Ushers and ambassadors are available for assistance at every performance.
For accessible seating, please notify Guest Services when purchasing tickets. This can be done online, by phone or in person at the Theater Square Box Office.
If you need assistance from the curb to your seat, ambassadors can provide a wheelchair upon arrival.

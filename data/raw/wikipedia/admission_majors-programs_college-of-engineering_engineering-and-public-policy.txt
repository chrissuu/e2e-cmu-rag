Engineering and Public Policy
The Department of Engineering and Public Policy (EPP) teaches you to understand and work at the intersection of science, technology and society. Crafting effective policy in domains as diverse as climate change, misinformation, national security, artificial intelligence, disaster response, privacy and critical infrastructure requires expertise that spans technical and social science fields. As an Engineering and Public Policy student, you'll develop the skills in policy analysis, risk assessment, data science and decision-making needed to solve today’s complex problems in business, government and nonprofits across the globe. You’ll graduate prepared to be a better, more socially responsible engineer.

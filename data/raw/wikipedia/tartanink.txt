Tartan Ink Print & Ship would like to acknowledge the students' efforts who took the time to show off their cartoon drawing skills while they were at Tartan Ink.
As promised, here is a look at some of their talented doodling!
Visit Tartan Ink Print & Ship in the UC for all your printing, copying, and shipping needs. While you’re here, showcase your doodle skills—your artwork might be featured on our homepage next time!
Thank you to all the students who participated!
Tartan Ink now offers a convenient Grab & Go pickup for prepaid, completed print jobs!
You’ll find it on the shelving unit just outside our storefront. Please check there first before coming inside to pick up your order. Available during regular business hours only.

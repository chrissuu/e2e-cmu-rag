Generating Buzz and Creating Demand
The internship led to a full-time position with Kraft, where he worked on campaigns for many well-known Kraft brands such as Planters nuts and A.1. Steak Sauce. After having worked on a variety of Kraft brands, Will’s career in marketing took him to a few jobs in multiple states including a brand manager and global equity lead for BIC® Lighters.
His path also took him to a small, private equity company and later into the RV resort business.
“I didn’t know about the RV business, but I knew about marketing,” Will says. “If you know how to generate buzz and create demand, and you’re a great storyteller, regardless of the product or brand, you’ll be great in marketing because you’re connecting with consumers on an emotional level.”
In April 2022, he was recruited by the fintech company, Early Warning, the owner and network operator of Zelle to serve as the director of corporate branding.
With more than 5 billion transactions totaling more than $1.5 trillion, Zelle connects financial institutions of all sizes. It enables consumers and businesses to send fast digital payments to people and businesses they know and trust with a U.S. bank account.
In his role, he’s responsible for developing the marketing strategies and campaigns for the company’s strategic brands and products including go-to-market strategies for innovation or new product launches.
Currently, he has an opportunity to lead high-exposure and strategic projects — such as a “game-changing product” due out this year — where he provides weekly updates to the C-suite.
With his career experiences so far as well as his CMU education, he’s prepared for wherever life takes him as he pursues his goals.
“Ultimately, I want to be a chief marketing officer, a business unit president or a general manager for a company and run an entire business unit,” says Will.

Elizabeth completed her undergraduate degree at Evergreen State College, an experimental interdisciplinary school in her home state of Washington, and was looking for a graduate program in a similar vein when she found Carnegie Mellon. The fine arts graduate program required students to think about how art can intersect with science and engineering and to work with community partners to develop projects.
Those formative years at Carnegie Mellon led the couple to a passion for Pittsburgh, too. They hoped LAGI’s first large-scale art installation would be built in the Steel City and worked with local foundations to plan WindNest, a 2010 LAGI entrant, for Schenley Park. While developing the prototype, Elizabeth and Robert did educational outreach in the city, partnering with Pittsburgh Public Schools’s STEAM coordinator to provide programming in the schools and helping with a camp in the city’s Homewood neighborhood.
In 2015, however, the prototype ran into a challenge from the Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office. Ultimately, a full-scale version was instead built in the United Kingdom and opened to the public last year.
“We’d love to come back to Pittsburgh in some other way,” Robert says.
The couple hoped more of the designs that have been submitted to the LAGI competition would have been built by now, but they refer to their next 10 years as their “decade of deployment,” building connections to the various communities they work with and identifying the opportunities and challenges for implementation.

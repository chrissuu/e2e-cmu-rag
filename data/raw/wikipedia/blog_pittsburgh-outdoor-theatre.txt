Taking the interactivity for kids to the next level is Penny Arcade , part of the renowned Arcade Comedy Theater in Downtown Pittsburgh. Look for outdoor free shows periodically during the summer months at the Backyard at 8th and Penn.
Before the show, those aged 4-11 are encouraged to to draw, write and help craft the stories that will be told during the 45-minute improv show. During the production, children will have more opportunities to come up on stage and get in in on the act, too. Because this is improv and based on ever-changing ideas, no two shows are alike!

Drop-Off Info & Additional Resources
The mission of Environmental Services is to establish and maintain a refuse and recycling system that promotes a safe, litter-free and environmentally friendly City for all of its residents and customers.
The City of Pittsburgh is dedicated to providing residents with as many drop off resources as possible. These resources may be City owned and operated, in partnership with non-profits or businesses, or a private resource promoted by the City. What kind of waste are you looking to dispose of properly?

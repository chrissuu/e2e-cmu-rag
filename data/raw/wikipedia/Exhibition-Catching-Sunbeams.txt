Explore abstract sculptures by Pittsburgh-based artist Atticus Adams in "Catching Sunbeams from the Porch Swing of Wisteria Castle." Adams’ artworks — most made from metal mesh and wire — hang from the windows and ceilings of The Frick Pittsburgh's historic greenhouse, adding a whimsical touch to the vibrant, flora-filled oasis. The exhibition includes never before seen works as well as a site-specific sculpture inspired by the Frick’s history, collections, and founder, Helen Clay Frick.

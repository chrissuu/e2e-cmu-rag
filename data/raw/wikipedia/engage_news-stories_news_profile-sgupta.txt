"I have been privileged to be taught by some outstanding teachers at Carnegie Mellon," Sayam says. "My CMU education was absolutely critical to what I am today. Both the research and the courses I took have had a great influence on my career."
As a student taking graduate courses in Carnegie Mellon's Department of Chemistry , he was inspired by Carnegie Mellon faculty members such as Professor Bruce Armitage , J.C. Warner University Professor of Natural Sciences Krzysztof Matyjaszewski and Teresa Heinz Professor in Green Chemistry Terrence Collins .
Collins advised Sayam on his doctoral work in iron tetra-amido macrocyclic ligands (Fe-TAMLs), which are environmentally friendly catalysts that can be used to oxidize organic compounds. In the Collins lab, Sayam mentored six undergraduate students, teaching them about green chemistry. Collins says that Sayam was a dedicated, productive lab member.
"Sayam is spectacularly brilliant," says Collins, who is director of the Institute for Green Science . "He is a natural leader. He is creative. He inspires people around him with his enthusiasm for science and with his bigger picture thinking. He is charismatic and ebullient as a researcher and teacher."
After earning his doctorate, Sayam taught at IISER Pune, then a new institute.
"I was asked to teach the first-year class. It was a terrific experience," he says. "The students, some of the best from India, were terrific. I really enjoyed teaching them."
While at Pune, he helped found the Exciting Science Group, an initiative meant to share science with young students. Through the Exciting Science Group, Sayam partnered with local underresourced schools to connect them with researchers and help them learn about conducting research using the scientific method.

The Honus Wagner statue has had three different “homes” since being dedicated on April 30, 1955. Originally, the Wagner statue was located in Schenley Park, close to the Pirates early home, Forbes Field. It was then moved to Three Rivers Stadium and erected outside Gate C on July 21, 1972. The statue is now located at the home plate entrance to PNC Park.

Part of the Midwest Queer Comedy Festival! A bold, bitchy, and queer-as-hell comedy experience featuring anyone who proudly identifies as a b!tch. This special festival edition brings stand-up and improv together, as fierce stand-ups hit the mic and a cast of improvisers spin their sets into wild, unscripted scenes. Loud, unapologetic, and a little unhinged because being a b!tch is a badge of honor.

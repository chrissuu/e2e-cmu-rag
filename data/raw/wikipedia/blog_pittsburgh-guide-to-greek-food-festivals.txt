The Greek food festival season officially kicks off at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Oakland with a weeklong food festival with fantastic food and music until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. It's easy to make a day of visiting this festival, too, with the Carnegie Museum of Art and Natural History, Cathedral of Learning and Schenley Park all just short walk from the festival. In just one bite you'll see why this festival has now been going on for 60+ years.
Pro Tip: Head inside to find the dinners and a la carte options (their spanakopita and green beans yiahni are my two favorites) or go to the outdoor grill for gyros, Greek fries and salads.

School of Drama
Since 1914, Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama has been known as a place for wildly talented and technically masterful scholars of the performing arts. Here, you’ll be plunged into new realities alongside visionaries in every aspect of the craft — weaving together both storylines and costumes, building both characters and sets. Ultimately, you may be among the many CMU graduates who have gone on to win Tony Awards or Emmy Awards. But with or without the hardware, you’ll launch a career that’s creatively fulfilling.

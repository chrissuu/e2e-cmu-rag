Join the Legal Society
Established in 2011, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Legal Society was created in response to the shifting economic environment for arts organizations who needed new forms of financial support. The Legal Society includes firms of all sizes as well as in-house legal departments and has contributed more than $2.5 million to the Trust to date. Advantages of participation include opportunities for client entertainment, access to professional networking events, and invitations to Trust social events. Annual contribution levels vary by firm or department size.

Warning: If you’re the type to close your eyes during horror movies, enter this video at your own risk. Ed Gein was born on August 27, 1906, in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He and his elder brother, Henry, endured a difficult childhood, growing up with an alcoholic father and a mother who was verbally abusive towards her children. Ed coped by idolizing his mother, a fact that apparently concerned Henry. Occasionally, Henry instigated arguments with their mother in front of Ed. In 1944 Ed made a police report: Henry was missing. When the police arrived, Ed was able to lead them directly to his brother’s body, which was badly burned from a fire that had started near the family’s farm. Despite bruises discovered on the victim’s head, the death was ruled an accident. When Ed’s mother died the next year, he became a virtual hermit… …allegedly cordoning off the areas of the house his mother used most often so the areas could be, as if in a shrine, perfectly preserved. In 1957 Ed was spotted with a hardware store owner named Bernice Worden—right before she disappeared. When the police searched his family farm, Bernice was there—fatally shot and decapitated—and so was evidence that Ed Gein had been robbing graves and using body parts to make household items. Also discovered on the property was the head of Mary Hogan, a local woman who had disappeared in 1954. Both Bernice and Mary allegedly looked like Ed’s mother. He admitted to killing both woman but pled not guilty by reason of insanity and was mostly confined in a mental hospital until his death. Ed Gein inspired many of the murderous, mask-crafting, Oedipal villains of 20th-century horror movies and novels. Norman Bates from Psycho, Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs are all a little bit Ed.

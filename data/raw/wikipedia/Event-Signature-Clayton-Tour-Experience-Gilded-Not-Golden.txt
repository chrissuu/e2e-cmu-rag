Just announced! Gilded, Not Golden , the newly reinterpreted tour of Clayton, won a 2024 Leadership in History Award from the American Association for State and Local History .
Look beneath the “gilded” surface of the late 19th century to reveal the era's more complicated truths. Discover Pittsburgh’s influence as an industrial powerhouse through a shared dialogue about the ongoing legacies of the Gilded Age.
"The tour guide did an excellent job of explaining the house details, decorative arts, family history & Gilded Age, in general. I particularly liked how history of the working class was woven in as a counterpoint to the lavish lifestyle of the wealthy." - Claire L.
The Gilded Age was an era not only of immense wealth and progress, but also rapid industrialization, unprecedented immigration, and labor strife. Explore this pivotal time in our nation’s history at Clayton, the only remaining fully preserved Gilded Age mansion in Pittsburgh. Join your guide and other visitors for a conversational experience that shares the stories of the Frick family and other Pittsburghers, and considers how the legacy of the Gilded Age continues to affect us today.
1892 was a tumultuous year for the Frick family and the Pittsburgh steel industry. For this reason, tours of Clayton deal with potentially challenging subject matter, including discussions of violence, grief, and child loss.

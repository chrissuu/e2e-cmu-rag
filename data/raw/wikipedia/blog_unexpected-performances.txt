Downtown's newest destination for all things comedy is Arcade Comedy Theater . The nonprofit theater is an intimate 75-seat space hosting stand-up comedians, improvisational artists, sketch shows, variety acts and humorous performers of all types. Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre develops and showcases the works of local playwrights, from accomplished masters like August Wilson to promising new talents. Performances happen in the penthouse at 937 Liberty Avenue in the Cultural District. Catch a performance of Squonk Opera ...you won't be disappointed! Each performance features original music, design, staging and definite outside-the-box thinking. Just to give you an idea, their first show was created more than 20 years ago in a Pittsburgh junkyard. Other cutting-edge theater groups that are well worth watching include Stage 62 , performing in the Andrew Carnegie Free Library in Carnegie; the No Name Players in Mt. Lebanon; Off the Wall in Carnegie; Prime Stage Theatre Company , performing at the New Hazlett Theater on the North Side; and Barebones Productions , located in Braddock.

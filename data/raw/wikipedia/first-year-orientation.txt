First-Year Orientation
Thanks for a great orientation experience, Class of 2029+!
First-Year Orientation supports new students in a successful transition to Carnegie Mellon. Our summer communications and programs, combined with our week-long First-Year Orientation program, introduce incoming undergraduate students to our inclusive and caring campus community. Our First-Year Orientation program is a dynamic and engaging experience that will help new students build the foundation for academic success, community membership, well-being, campus involvement and pride in being a Tartan.

Become a Student Ambassador!
Now is a perfect time to become a Student Ambassador, spreading the word about Pittsburgh Opera and enjoying exclusive benefits!  Established by five intrepid women in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera is viewed as one of the most vibrant opera organizations in the U.S., with a rich artistic tradition, outstanding educational programs, and a progressive outlook toward the future that we want you to be a part of.
Even if you don’t know much about opera (yet!), if you’re outgoing and enthusiastic then we’d love to work with you. For those interested in a career in arts marketing or education, becoming a Student Ambassador is great opportunity to gain firsthand experience while enhancing your resume.  Student Ambassadors will be asked to hang posters on campus and to be a presence at campus fairs/events.  Most importantly, we want to hear YOUR ideas about how best to share Pittsburgh Opera with your fellow students.
As a Pittsburgh Opera Student Ambassador, you’ll receive:
A pair of complimentary tickets to each Benedum Center production
A free membership to the New Guard, Pittsburgh Opera’s young professional network
Networking opportunities with Pittsburgh Opera staff and other Student Ambassadors
If you can entice your fellow students to buy tickets over the course of the season, you can earn even more benefits !
5+ tickets – Get the star treatment with a pair of VIP seats at the Song Shop concert of your choice
15+ tickets – See the show before anyone else with an invite to a Benedum Center show final dress rehearsal
Please contact us via email letting us know why you would make a great Ambassador and an example of how you’d like to promote the opera on campus. We look forward to hearing from you!

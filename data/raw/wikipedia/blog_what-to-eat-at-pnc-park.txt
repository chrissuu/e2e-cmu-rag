PNC Park took last year's Renegade Dog and essentially transformed it into a burger. Introducing the Chili Crunch Smashburger ( Section 146, Cannonball Stand , two potato buns stacked high with an all beef patty, caramelized onion, American cheese, pickles, salt and vinegar chips and a chili crunch aioli in between. The chips really gives this burger the crunch its name promises, with the flavor countering the chili aioli so it's not too spicy.
If burgers aren't your thing, the new Hot Honey Chicken Croissant ( Section 144 ) might be up your alley, complete with pub cheese, bacon, and pickles. The sauce is absolutely delicious. There's also the Kielbasa Cheesesteak ( Section 146, Cannonball Stand ), which has caramelized onion, kielbasa, and provolone sauce on an Italian hoagie. Coming from someone who is Polish, the kielbasa was fantastic and paired well with the sauce. Another classic Pittsburgh food item can be found in the Chipped Ham Empanada ( Section 146, Cannonball Stand ), alongside pickles, cheddar cheese, and a hot honey BBQ sauce that's tanginess will surprise you. I heard someone say the empanada reminded them of their childhood, and I'm inclined to agree.
Those who want something more vegan and vegetarian friendly, head to Homeplate Market for some Beyond Chicken Tender , a plant-based protein that comes with honey mustard and vegan ranch.

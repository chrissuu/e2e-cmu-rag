Carnegie Mellon University student Ali Shakir is working to correct an error in how cosmologists measure intrinsic galaxy alignments.
When viewing faint galaxy images, researchers have to factor in distortions such as when a distribution of matter — like a cluster of galaxies — has a gravitational field that bends the light of a distant source as it travels toward an observer. The phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing.
“In weak gravitational lensing, light comes from a background source that passes through a large concentration of mass like a galaxy cluster. That gets deflected, according to Einstein’s theory of relativity,” says Ali, a junior in the Mellon College of Science majoring in physics and statistics and data science. “Cosmologists care about measuring this lensing because it tells us about how matter— and specifically dark matter —is distributed through the universe.”
He spent the summer working in the lab of Mellon College of Science Professor Rachel Mandelbaum this summer through a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship grant, known as a SURF, which is provided through Carnegie Mellon’s Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholar Development.
The work is part of a weak gravitational lensing project by Mandelbaum’s research group, which applies methods from statistics and machine learning to cosmological problems involving large data sets.

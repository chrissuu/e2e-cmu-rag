Designed by Pittsburgh architects Pratt, Schafer & Slowik, the Italian Renaissance-style Frick Art Museum was built by founder Helen Clay Frick to house her collection of fine and decorative arts, as well as paintings, sculpture and porcelains that she had inherited from her father. Strengths of the collection include French 18th-century painting and decorative arts, early Italian Renaissance painting, Renaissance and Baroque bronzes, and extraordinary Chinese porcelains.

Tartans for Life
Partners. Volunteers. Leaders. Alumni. Friends. The members of the CMU Alumni Association Board (AAB) are all of these and more.
This hardworking group of alumni reflects the diversity of the universityâ€™s alumni body, spanning a broad range of colleges, class years, careers and hometowns as well as interests and experiences. But they all have one thing in common: a dedication and love for CMU.
AAB members use their creativity and professional and volunteer experience to work closely with the Office of Alumni & Constituent Engagement to develop and strengthen programs that connect alumni to CMU and to each other.

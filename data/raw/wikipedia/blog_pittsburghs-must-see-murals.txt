Moving the Lives of Kids (MLK) Community Mural Project is a nonprofit organization with the mission to inspire, educate and empower the youth through public art. Founded by established Pittsburgh artist and muralist Kyle Holbrook, this program aims to use public art as a means to reach kids over the summer months to do positive community work. Through the years, the project has expanded beyond Pittsburgh and into 56 cities, 27 states and 43 countries.
The beautiful, collaborative MLK Pittsburgh Murals can be found in a number of neighborhoods throughout the city. In the Hill District, youâ€™ll find a tribute to the late Pittsburgh playwright August Wilson . The mural was created with the support of 10 students and includes each of their favorite August Wilson plays. In East Liberty, a mural honors the late Pittsburgh-native Mac Miller. In Larimer, the We Fall Down but We Get Back Up mural features portraits of East Enders, which Miller helped paint with a group in 2008.
With hundreds of Pittsburgh residents engaged, the MLK Project has created more than 40 murals throughout the city, including the murals along the MLK East Busway spanning eight neighborhoods.

“If you weave or make your garments out of the gelatin fibers, they can just be dissolved,” Mike says of his hopes for the project in the future. “So when you're done with it, you just throw it in really hot water, it dissolves away, and you can reuse the solution to make more garments or fibers.”
Mike, a native of Philadelphia who earned two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in digital media design and computer graphics and game technology before earning his Ph.D. in 2021, calls the ATLAS Institute “an institute for radical creativity and invention,” meaning he’s not just working with computer scientists, but also, for example, music researchers who are studying how music interacts with the human brain.
“I would say the institute is really a hub for people who cross disciplinary boundaries and then try to find creative and inventive solutions to problems,” he says. “I see similarities between ATLAS and HCII.”
And his experience at CMU gave him the background he needed to be comfortable doing research across multiple disciplines.
“It was sort of at the height of a lot of the 3D printing developments, so Scott was doing work with printers, but he was also writing software, programming machines,” Mike says. “So the thing that was interesting was I had a lot of freedom in the HCII to cross these disciplinary boundaries.”
“I spent my first summer there building like six custom printers,” he adds. “I think one of the benefits I had in the HCII was that I was surrounded by people who were working on different, but potentially related things.”

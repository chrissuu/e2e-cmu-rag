A trip to Pittsburgh isn't complete without a Primanti Brothers signature sandwich! Topped with coleslaw and French fries, foodies can get a taste of Pittsburgh in a sandwich. Located on 18th Street, this is the original Primati Bros. that's been in business since 1933. It's even open until 2 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays for the late-night and post-party crowd.
Located in the heart of the Strip District, Deluca’s Diner is a must-see stop. A hit diner since 1950, it can be described as, “good mood food.” Enjoy both breakfast and lunch at any time, any day. You won’t regret your trip here!
Serving traditional Italian pastries, the Enrico Biscotti Company is one of Pittsburgh's finest hidden gems. Enrico's is made up of two parts: the café, serving up breakfast and lunch, and the bakery, which offers delicious biscotti, macaroons and more. Bread and pizza-making classes are also available.

There are various kinds of dietary preferences. In the United States, among Americans, about
47 percent are flexitarians (also called reducetarians , who mainly following a vegetarian diet, actively reducing their consumption of meat, but will flexibly and occasionally eat meat or fish)

And an increasing  number of flexitarians consider themselves social omnivores ( omnivore : eating both plant-based and animal-based foods): they eat no meat at home but are willing to consume it when out with family and friends. [159] [161] [162] [163] [164]

There are even political connotations associated with certain diets—some 11 percent of Americans who identify as liberal follow a vegetarian diet, compared to only 2 percent of conservatives . [136]
Globally, in most countries, vegetarians are a small minority. India is an exception where some 29.5 percent of the population is vegetarian—the highest percentage of vegetarians in the world—and 81 percent, though they do not exclude meat entirely, actively limit it in their diets. India also has the highest percentage of vegans in the world, comprising 9 percent of its population. [160] [165]
Historical Vegetarianism
In Western culture, vegetarianism dates back to ancient Greece . The mathematician Pythagoras (570 BC – 495 BC) advocated vegetarianism. A meatless diet was commonly called the “Pythagorean diet” until the term vegetarian became popular during the 1800s. The philosopher Plato (428 BC – 348 BC) described a vegetarian diet as “divinely ordained.” [70] [120]
Other well-known vegetarians include Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), George Bernard Shaw (1712-1778), Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948), and Franz Kafka (1883-1924). [71] [81]
In 1850, the American Vegetarian Society was formed by Reverend Sylvester Graham (1794-1851), a nutritionist and the inventor of the graham cracker . The society advocated vegetarianism and avoiding white flour to promote health and cure alcoholism and lust . [77]
In the late 1800s, Seventh-Day Adventism , a form of Christianity , was developed in the United States. The Seventh-Day Adventist Church preached and practiced vegetarianism as the most ethical, spiritual, and healthy diet. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (1852-1953), the inventor of corn flakes, was a member. Adventists believe God intended humans to be stewards of the creatures of the earth, not consumers of them. [55] [75] [78]
Many Quakers , Buddhists , Hindus , and Rastafarians also advocate vegetarianism as an extension of their belief in practicing non-violence. [83]
American Vegetarianism
In 1906 Upton Sinclair published The Jungle , a popular book about Chicago’s filthy, unhygienic meatpacking facilities, and the meatpacking industry in general, and their exploited immigrant workers. The book’s graphic descriptions led to a government investigation and the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 . It also influenced the vegetarian movement, leading some to question their eating of meat and to switch to a plant-based diet. [99]
In 1916 the USDA issued its first food guide, “Food for Young Children,” which included meat and milk in one of five necessary food groups for optimal health. The next year, the U.S. government advocated “Meatless Tuesdays” to conserve meat for the troops fighting in World War I . [69] [82]
In the 1950s post-war prosperity caused demand for meat to increase. With little new grassland left to support expanding livestock herds, farmers began turning to grain and soy , rather than pasture grasses, to feed their animals. By 1960 U.S. soybean production nearly tripled that of China . [28]
In 1958, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) into law under opposition from the USDA and the meat industry. The law sought to minimize the pain of animals by mandating livestock be stunned unconscious before slaughter. An exemption was made for ritual slaughter under religious law. Poultry are exempt from the HMSA. [65]
In the 1970s, U.S. public interest in vegetarianism grew, fueled by books such as Frances Moore Lappe’s Diet for a Small Planet and Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation . In 1974, the North American Vegetarian Society and the magazine Vegetarian Times were founded. [70]
In 1980, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) formed to advocate for a vegan diet and an end to using animals for testing , entertainment, or clothing. PETA remains one of the largest animal rights organizations in the world. [72]
On October 18, 1987, the American Dietetic Association (ADA) released its first position paper endorsing a vegetarian diet stating that “appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.” [1]
Vegetarianism Debate: 1990s – 2010
In the early 1990s, Dr. Temple Grandin devised transportation devices, stockyards , loading ramps, and restraining systems designed to minimize stress and to calm animals as they are led to slaughter . In 1991, Grandin’s recommendations for humane animal handling and slaughter were adopted by the American Meat Institute, the oldest and largest meat and poultry trade association in the country. [88] [91]
In December 1995, the USDA stated for the first time that “vegetarian diets are consistent with the dietary guidelines for Americans and can meet the recommended dietary allowances for nutrients.” [68] [69]
The Center for Consumer Freedom was formed in 1996 to fight against what it termed “self-anointed ‘food police,’” and “animal-rights misanthropes .” The group lobbies for the food industry against health regulations and lawsuits, and advocates eating meat as a “personal choice.” One of its main targets has been the animal rights organization PETA. [94] \
On April 16, 1996, the Oprah Show aired a debate between former rancher and vegan and animal-rights activist Howard Lyman and Gary Weber, spokesperson for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA). After Lyman described how dead cows were ground into feed for other cows, risking the spread of mad cow disease , Oprah Winfrey stated: “It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger .” The show caused a fall in cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and prompted the NCBA to sue Oprah for “disparagement” of beef—a case they eventually lost. After the Oprah controversy, the USDA implemented a ban prohibiting “the use of most mammalian protein in the manufacture of animal feed intended for cattle and other ruminants.” [79] [80]
The Weston A. Price Foundation was founded in 1999 to promote the consumption of organic “nutrient-dense” foods including raw cow’s milk , butter , and meat . The foundation actively cautions people against vegetarian diets and promotes eating meat and saturated fat for good health. [95]
The health benefits of a vegetarian diet were outlined in a 2001 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine . [76]
On April 10, 2001, the Washington Post re-ignited public debate about slaughterhouses with the exposé “ They Die Piece by Piece .” The investigation found that animals in slaughterhouses were often cut apart “piece by piece” while still conscious. The public outcry that followed led Congress to earmark funds specifically for enforcing the HMSA (Humane Methods of Slaughter Act ), which the USDA used to hire a veterinarian in each of its 15 districts to oversee enforcement. In 2002, Congress passed a resolution urging the USDA to fully enforce and track violations of the HMSA. [65] [66]
Dr. T. Colin Campbell published the results of a 20-year study conducted by Cornell University , Oxford University , and the Chinese Academy of Preventative Medicine in 2005. The China Study found that people who ate the most plant-based foods were the healthiest, and that people who ate the most animal-based foods developed the highest rates of diseases such as diabetes and cancer . However, the study was criticized in Wise Traditions , the magazine of the Weston A. Price Foundation, as “biased” with evidence “selected, presented, and interpreted” in favor of a vegetarian or vegan diet. [73] [74]
In 2006, the American market for processed vegetarian foods, such as faux meat, non-dairy milks, and frozen vegetarian entrees, was estimated to be $1.17 billion and growing. [1]
Post-2010s Polls, Studies, and Political Figures
In 2010 President Bill Clinton adopted a vegan diet (no meat , eggs , dairy , or other animal products) after his second heart surgery. In August 2011 Clinton stated, “my blood tests are good, and my vital signs are good, and I feel good, and I also have, believe it or not, more energy.” [119]
First Lady Michelle Obama unveiled the USDA “ My Plate ” image on June 2, 2011, representing the five essential food groups and replacing the previous Food Pyramid . “My Plate” renamed the “Meat & Beans” category to “Protein,” and changed the “Milk” category to “Dairy.” The other three categories (Grains, Vegetables , and Fruits ) remained the same.
In January 2013, the Active Learning Elementary School in the Flushing neighborhood of Queens , New York, became the first public school in the United States to serve an all-vegetarian menu in its cafeteria. [131]
The World Health Organization (WHO) classified processed meats as carcinogenic to humans, and red meat as probably carcinogenic in 2015.
Researchers from the University of California at Davis found that health was the most common motivation for switching to a vegetarian diet. The results of the three-year, 8,000-person study, published in April 2020, found that concern about the environment and animal rights had less impact on the decision to give up meat. The authors noted that people following a plant-based diet for health reasons are also the least strict and compliant with vegetarianism. [141]
Impact of COVID-19 on Meat Supply
During the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the closure of meat processing facilities due to the spread of the coronavirus led to concerns about a global meat shortage. Beyond Meat, a plant-based meat substitute that generated over $150 million in 2019 revenue, experienced a 41 percent jump in stock price due to threats of a disruption in the meat supply in April 2020. [142] [143]
On April 28, 2020, President Trump signed an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture “to ensure America’s meat and poultry processors continue operations uninterrupted to the maximum extent possible.” The Executive Order stated that closing a single large beef processing plant results in a decrease of 10 million servings of beef per day.
The Future of Vegetarianism
An October 2023 study published in PLOS ONE found that vegetarianism may be linked to a person’s DNA . While greater research is needed, the study seems to show that people with certain gene variants can more easily adapt to a vegetarian diet, while those without the pro-vegetarian variants have a difficult time entirely removing animal products from their diets. [156]

Pro 1: Killing animals for food is cruel and unethical.
Raising animals in confinement for slaughter is cruel, and many animals in the United States are not humanely slaughtered.
Animals are sentient beings that have emotions and social connections. Scientific studies show that cattle, pigs, chickens, and all warm-blooded animals can experience stress, pain, and fear. About 50 percent of meat produced in the United States comes from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where mistreated animals live in filthy, overcrowded spaces with little or no access to pasture, natural light, or clean air. In CAFOs pigs have their tails cut short; chickens have their toenails, spurs, and beaks clipped; and cows have their horns removed and tails docked with no painkillers. Pregnant pigs are kept in metal gestation crates barely bigger than the pigs themselves. Baby cows raised for veal are tied up and confined in tiny stalls their entire short lives (3-18 weeks). [32] [35] [41] [100] [147]
The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) mandates that livestock be stunned unconscious before slaughter to minimize suffering. However, birds such as chickens and turkey are exempted from the HMS, and a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Organization (GAO) found that the USDA was not “taking consistent actions to enforce the HMSA.” [65] [66] [90]
In 2017 (the most recent data available), the United States slaughtered a total of 170.6 million animals for food, including 124.5 million pigs, 33.7 million cows, 9.2 million chickens, and 2.4 million sheep. These animals should not have to die painfully and fearfully to satisfy an unnecessary dietary preference.
Pro 2: A vegetarian diet is healthy.
According to the American Dietetic Association, a vegetarian diet can meet protein requirements, provide all the essential amino-acids (the building blocks of protein), and provide all the necessary vitamins, fats, and minerals. In fact, a 2025 study found that a vegan diet offered the same “muscle-building potential” as an omnivore diet. And, a vegetarian diet can improve one’s health. [1] [2] [158]
According to the USDA and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, meat is not an essential part of a healthy diet. Further, studies have linked heme iron found in red meat with an increased risk of colorectal, stomach, and esophageal cancers. Vegetarian sources of iron like leafy greens and beans contain non-heme iron. [3] [4] [68] [123] [150]
Meat also has high renal acid levels which the body must neutralize by leaching calcium from the bones, which is then passed into urine and lost. There are many sources of healthy vegetarian calcium including tofu, dark leafy greens like kale, spinach, and collard greens, as well as fortified cereals. [5] [128]
Vegetarian diets can reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance to bacteria, kidney stones, gallstones, death from heart disease, high blood pressure, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [40] [64] [102] [122] [132] [140] [148]
Several studies show that vegetarian diets increase the lifespan of adherents by 3.6 to 7.28 years. [76] [86] [121] [130]
Pro 3: A vegetarian diet is better for the environment.
Overgrazing livestock hurts the environment through soil compaction, erosion, and harm to native plants and animals. Grazing has also damaged streams and riparian areas in the western United States; it has also been a factor in the listing of at least 171 species of animals and plants under the Endangered Species Act because the large tracts of flat land interrupt natural habitats. Abstaining from eating meat would help restore land more naturally suited to provide habitat for native plants and animals. [29] [92] [93]
A vegetarian diet also conserves water. Producing one pound of beef takes about 1,800 gallons of water, one pound of pork uses about 576 gallons, one pound of turkey needs about 486 gallons, and each pound of chicken requires about 468 gallons. Meanwhile, a pound of tofu only takes about 302 gallons. [151] [152] [153]
Additionally, raising animals for food contributes to air and water pollution. Manure produces toxic hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which pollute the air and leach poisonous nitrates into nearby waters. Runoff laden with manure is a major cause of “dead zones” in 173,000 miles of U.S. waterways, including the 7,700-square-mile dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. [32] [115] [116]
All told, a vegetarian diet leads to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases are created by enteric fermentation (aka, animal farts and burps), manure decomposition, and deforestation to make room for grazing animals and growing feed. Diets including meat cause the creation of up to 54 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than vegetarian diets. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, a “worldwide diet change away from animal products” is necessary to stop the worst effects of global climate change. [104] [134]
Con 1: Eating meat is natural.
Vegetarians mistakenly elevate the value of animal life over plant life. Research shows that plants also respond electrochemically to threats. Every organism on earth dies at some point so others organisms can live, and there is nothing wrong with this cycle. Humans are animals, too, and fit naturally into the existing ecosystems that allow for carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores. [98] [148]
Moreove, contrary to arguments by animal advocates, U.S. slaughterhouses adhere to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) that mandates that livestock be stunned unconscious before slaughter. Many of the largest U.S. meat producers also adhere to the handling standards developed by Dr. Temple Grandin that factor in animal psychology to design transportation devices, stockyards, loading ramps, and restraining systems that minimize stress and calm animals as they are led to slaughter. [65] [87] [88] [89]
Further, there is a growing movement to raise “cruelty-free” organic meat. In the United States, animals raised for certified organic meat must be given access to the outdoors, clean air, and water. They cannot be given growth hormones or antibiotics and must be fed organically grown feed free of animal byproducts. According to a 2007 report from the Range Improvement Task Force, organic meat accounted for 3 percent of total U.S. meat production. By the end of 2012 “natural and organic” beef accounted for 4 percent of total beef sales in the United States. And, in 2019, 76 percent of consumers thought that grocery stores should sell meat and poultry raised and slaughtered with good animal welfare standards. By all accounts, the production of and demand for ethically raised meat products is soaring. [84] [85] [129] [149]
Con 2: Eating meat, poultry, and fish is part of a healthy diet.
Lean red meat, eaten in moderation, can be a healthful part of a balanced diet. According to researchers at the British Nutrition Foundation, “there is no evidence” that moderate consumption of unprocessed lean red meat has any negative health effects. Poultry like chicken and turkey, unprocessed pork (e.g. pork loin, not bacon), and fish are considered healthy components in a diet. [50]
Meat is the most convenient protein source available. In one serving, meat provides all the essential amino acids (the building blocks of protein), as well as essential nutrients such as iron, zinc, and B vitamins. Most plant foods do not provide adequate levels of all the essential amino acids in a single serving. [3] [46] [47] [49] [61] [101] [133]
Meat is the best source of necessary saturated fats, vitamins, A, D, E, and K, good cholesterol, iron, zinc, and amino acids. And fish is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which lower the risk of death from heart attacks and strokes. [3] [46] [47] [52] [53]
Vegetarians do not live longer. This myth stems from the fact that vegetarians tend to be more health conscious overall, eating a more balanced diet, exercising more, and smoking less than the general population. However, when compared to health-conscious meat eaters, vegetarians do not live longer. [56]
Con 3: Vegetarian diets are not necessarily better for the environment.
Raising beef is often the most efficient way to produce food for humans, especially considering about 85 percent of U.S. grazing land is not suitable for raising crops humans can eat. Natural prairie grasslands can coexist with sustainable herds of cattle or bison, but they cannot coexist with monocrop agriculture. [27]
Growing crops isn’t always the best for the environment. Almost 100 million acres of farmland in the Corn Belt has lost all topsoil due to erosion, polluting nearby waterways. Further, 94 percent of U.S. soybeans and 92 percent of corn were genetically modified (GMOs), which are immune to herbicides, alowing farmers to douse their fields with large quantities of herbicides that are toxic to other plants and fish. Increased herbicide use could create “super weeds.” And, vegetarian diets can cause the death of animals, too: about six animals per acre, or 52-77 percent of the animals (such as birds, mice, and rabbits) that live in agricultural crop fields, are killed during harvest. [43] [44] [118] [154] [155]
Processed vegetarian protein options such as tofu [which is made with soy beans] can cause more greenhouse gas pollution than farming meat. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) found that the production of soy-based proteins could contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than eating locally produced meat. Giving up all animal products would only give a 7 percent reduction in green house gas emissions. [16] [106]
Further, it is not necessary to become vegetarian to lower our environmental footprint. Some vegetarians eat an unhealthy diet, drive SUVs, and consume eggs and dairy products produced at factory farms (at Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs). Some meat eaters use solar panels, ride bikes, grow their own vegetables, and eat free-range organic meat. A person’s total lifestyle—not just a single act such as eating meat—must be considered.

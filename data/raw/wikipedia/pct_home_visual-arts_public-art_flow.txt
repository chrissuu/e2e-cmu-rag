Flow
Erwin Redl, 2014
Installed on the facade of Wood Street Galleries, Flow by digital artist Erwin Redl is a monumental light installation that transforms the 7th Street block of Liberty Avenue into a beacon of dynamic visual energy. Composed of 40,128 animated red LEDs, the work spans 90 feet in height and pulses with synchronized patterns that shift rhythmically across the building’s exterior.
The installation responds to both its architectural context and the flow of urban life, creating a powerful visual landmark in the heart of Pittsburgh’s Cultural District. Flow exemplifies Redl’s signature use of light as a sculptural and spatial medium. Through precision, repetition, and algorithmic design, the work invites viewers to experience data, light, and architecture as a unified, evolving field.

If you want to make an impact now at The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and also provide for your family later, consider setting up a charitable lead trust. You transfer cash or other assets to a trust that makes payments to The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust for a period of time. When the term is up, the remaining trust passes to your family or other beneficiaries you select.
There are two ways that charitable lead trusts make payments to the Trust:
A charitable lead annuity trust pays a fixed amount each year to the Trust and is more attractive when interest rates are low.
A charitable lead unitrust pays a variable amount each year to the Trust based on the value of the assets in the trust. With a unitrust, if the trust's assets go up in value, for example, the payments to the Trust go up as well.

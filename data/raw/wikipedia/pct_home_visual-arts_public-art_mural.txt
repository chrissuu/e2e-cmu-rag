Mural
Richard Haas, 1993
In 1993, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust commissioned renowned American muralist Richard Haas to create a striking homage to Pittsburgh’s historic steel industry. Located on the Fort Duquesne Boulevard façade of the Byham Theater, the mural exemplifies Haas’s mastery of trompe l’oeil —a technique that employs highly realistic imagery to create the optical illusion of three-dimensional architectural elements on a flat surface.
Haas’s design ingeniously incorporates the theater’s existing doors and windows, seamlessly blending painted details with real architectural features to produce a dynamic and immersive visual experience. Reflecting on the complexity of the project in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, Haas described the mural as "one of the most complicated façades I've done," underscoring the technical and artistic challenges involved in transforming the theater’s façade into a monumental work of public art.

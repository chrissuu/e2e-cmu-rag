Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Extends Byron Stripling’s
Contract as Principal Pops Conductor Through 28/29 Season
PITTSBURGH, PA – The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) announced today that it has
extended the contract of Byron Stripling as Principal Pops Conductor through the 28/29
season. A charismatic trumpeter, conductor and vocalist, Stripling has led the PSO’s PNC Pops
series as Principal Pops Conductor since 2020, holding the Henry and Elsie Hillman Principal
Pops Conductor Chair, bringing energy, joy, and artistry to Heinz Hall.
“Byron has an extraordinary gift for connecting with audiences of all ages,” said Melia
Tourangeau, President & CEO of the PSO. “His impact goes far beyond the PNC Pops series.
Whether he’s leading Fiddlesticks, a Pops concert, or inspiring students at rehearsals and in local
classrooms, Byron embodies the PSO’s mission to share music as a transformative force. I am
thrilled to continue this partnership with him.”
Under the contract extension, Stripling will continue to conduct three subscription weeks of the
PNC Pops each season and remain an integral part of the Symphony’s artistic and community
life. Beyond his Pops leadership, Stripling has also conducted special concerts, led PSO’s
Fiddlesticks Family Concerts, and visited Pittsburgh schools, engaging young audiences with his
warmth and passion for music.
“I am deeply honored to extend my time as Principal Pops Conductor with this incredible
orchestra,” said Byron Stripling. “The musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony are second to
none, and together we’ve been able to create concerts that uplift, celebrate, and bring people
together. I can’t wait to make even more joyful music with this community.”
The PSO’s 25/26 PNC Pops season launches this weekend with Come Swing with Me, a high-
energy tribute to the hits of the 1950s led by Stripling and featuring vocalist Paul Loren. In
February, Stripling leads America the Beautiful, an original program tracing the evolution of
American music in honor of the nation’s 250th anniversary. The season also brings the return of
Bugs Bunny at the Symphony in celebration of the cartoon icon’s 85th anniversary,
December’s beloved Highmark Holiday Pops, and a special collaboration with Pittsburgh CLO
for Rodgers & Hammerstein’s South Pacific in Concert. The season closes out with Tropical
Rock in April and Disco Divas in June conducted by Stripling.

ProCon Debate: Should Historic Statues Be Taken Down?
ProCon Issue in the News: A statue of communist revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara was removed from Tabacalera Park in Mexico City in July 2025 by Alessandra Rojo de la Vega, mayor of the Mexico City municipality Cuauhtémoc.
The statue depicts Castro and Guevara seated on a bench, and it was installed in 2017 to commemorate their 1955 meeting in Mexico City. The two are shown in conversation, planning the Cuban Revolution . The revolution resulted in the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista’s government in Cuba and  Castro’s rise to power.
Rojo de la Vega called the Castro and Guevara “murderers,” referencing the many Cubans who were persecuted, jailed, and killed during Castro’s regime, and said, “I understand that there are people who see Fidel and Che as their revolutionary figures, but governing isn’t about choosing which victims to show solidarity to.”
Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum disagreed, calling the statue’s removal “illegal” and “total intolerance.” However, during her time as the head of Mexico City government, the leftist politician removed a plaque commemorating former right-wing Mexican president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz and a monument to Christopher Columbus . Rojo de la Vega noted this point when explaining that she did not expect controversy to arise from the statue’s removal: “I don’t think a dictator is any less of a dictator if they’re from the left, the center or the right.”

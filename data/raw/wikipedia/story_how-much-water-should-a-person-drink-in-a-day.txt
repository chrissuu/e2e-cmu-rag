The popular recommendation to drink 8 cups of water every day isn’t as definitive as it may seem.
The amount of water one should drink depends on a number of factors, including age, biological sex, and activity level. On average, women need to consume about 11 cups (2.7 liters) of water (the U.S. customary measurement) to stay hydrated each day, while men require approximately 15 cups (3.7 liters). Some 20 percent of this water intake comes from foods rather than beverages.
Since water makes up about 60 percent of a human’s body weight, hydration is key to maintaining health . The brain has an even higher concentration of water than the rest of the body at 73 percent, so hydration ensures that brain activity stays consistent. Drinking enough water also elevates energy levels, reduces the risk of heart failure , and lubricates joints. Signs of dehydration include thirst, dry skin, and headaches.

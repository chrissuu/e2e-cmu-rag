He finds himself referring to other tenets he learned while a student at CMU, ones that he uses nearly every day in his work. First, the aforementioned ‘can-do’ attitude, instilled by the teachers he had at the school: Steve Lee, Bruce Lindsey, Stephanie Bartos and Scott Smith. Next, a belief that you must follow a lifelong path of curiosity and learning. Third, Goil says that CMU instilled him with a sense of ‘responsibility,’ which is to say the ‘ability’ and passion to ‘respond.’
“It’s more than the brick,” he says. “We want what we make to be thoughtful and have meaning.”
Having a partner who shares his philosophies helps, too. On working with Tom, Goil says that compatibility plays into everything they do.
“To every pot, you need the right lid,” Goil says. “We trust each other. Tom sees the best. This optimism is a uniquely American perspective to everything.”
When giving advice to current students and young architects, Goil encourages them to “connect the dots, look at challenges and see opportunities. Be present, open and available. Take risks. And always, be a good, ethical person, even if it doesn’t pay off right away.”
Successful architects, Tom added, are those who can imagine something that doesn’t yet exist, helping to resolve a concern or meet a need.
Goil concurred. “Architecture, education and practice can truly engage the world.”

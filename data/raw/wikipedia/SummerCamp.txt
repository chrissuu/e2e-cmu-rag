Kids entering grades 2–5
Explore, imagine, and create in Pittsburgh's best backyard! Kids entering grades 2–5 can join the Frick for an exciting week filled with art, history, and nature. Campers will get creative through traditional and non-traditional art mediums, including printmaking, painting, and mixed-media sculpture. They will also have the opportunity to explore the Frick's museums, the greenhouse, and our 10 acres of grounds and gardens. Camp will end with an art show open to friends and family on Friday, August 8 at 2:15 PM!
For the safety of all, we ask that any child who is ill remains at home; absences due to illness qualify for a refund.
Applications for full or partial scholarships are open until June 1st. To apply or request more information, please email

summer camp for an additional $90 fee.
Post-camp care includes artmaking, outdoor activities, reading, and play in a more relaxed atmosphere from 3:00 PM – 5:30 PM on each day of camp.

Clayton, the historic home of Henry Clay Frick, is the only remaining fully preserved Gilded Age mansion in Pittsburgh. The home underwent an extensive restoration in the late 1980s, aided in large part by the Frick family's comprehensive collection of documents and records. But why doesn't the kitchen have its original stove? How did painted exterior brick lead to interior water damage? And since houses change over time, who decides what version to restore?
Explore those questions, and many others, on the Preservation Tour, as you trace the house's evolution from a family home to a public museum. Examine previous restoration projects and ongoing efforts to preserve Clayton for the future — including before and after views of the home's current exterior preservation work.
These special tours are part of a specific fundraising campaign focused on raising funds for the care and conservation of Clayton for future generations. Because of that, the ticket price is considered a donation and is fully tax deductible. All ticket buyers will receive a letter confirming that the cost of their tickets can be used as part of their itemized deductions.
Thank you for helping us to preserve this important historic landmark!

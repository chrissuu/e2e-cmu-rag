Westinghouse Electric was founded by George Westinghouse in Pittsburgh in 1886 and quickly became active in developing electric infrastructure throughout the United States. The company's largest factories were located in East Pittsburgh where they made turbines, generators, motors, as well as pioneering long-distance power transmission and high-voltage alternating-current transmission. In addition to George Westinghouse, engineers working for the company included Frank Conrad, Oliver B. Shallenberger, and Nikola Tesla. The company was historically the rival to Thomas Edison's electric company which was later merged into the even bigger competitor, General Electric.

Digital Tickets
All Pirates tickets will be delivered digitally via the MLB Ballpark app. We encourage you to review your account and ensure all tickets appear as expected within the app before you arrive at PNC Park .
To avoid any delay entering the ballpark, fans should proactively reset their password before arriving at the game. For the best experience, use the latest version of the Ballpark app when accessing your tickets and ensure you log out of all MLB applications and log back in with your updated password. Remember that screenshots of your tickets will not be accepted.
While reviewing your account, if you are unable to see or access your tickets in the app, please contact us at ticketservices@pirates.com .

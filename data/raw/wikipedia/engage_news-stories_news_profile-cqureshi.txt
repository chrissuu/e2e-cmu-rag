Branching Out
After graduating from Heinz College, Catherine left Pittsburgh for a job at the Government Finance Officers Association in Chicago.
The position jump-started her career, and she credits CMU for helping her get there.
“That job catapulted me forward,” Catherine says. “Perhaps I wouldn't have done that, if I didn't have the confidence and the experience from completing that CMU degree. It was an important time in my life.”
Catherine’s experience working in Chicago was very different from her experiences in Pittsburgh.
“When I was working in the mayor's office in Pittsburgh, there was such a connection to really big things that were going on,” Catherine says. “You could open the newspaper and see things where you were involved. It was really exciting, and it wasn’t like that in Chicago.”
She returned to Pittsburgh.
“Sometimes, you have values that you don't know exist until they are removed from you,” Catherine says. “I really wanted to come back where I felt there was more opportunity to be involved and engaged with things that were growing the city.”
Since then, she has worked in the administrations of two Pittsburgh mayors, held positions on Pittsburgh City Council and at the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, and served as the assistant finance director for the city.

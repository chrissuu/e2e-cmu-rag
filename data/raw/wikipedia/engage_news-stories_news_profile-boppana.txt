Taking the Stage
It didn’t take long for Shriya to fall in love with the social impact work at Save Our Stars. She began looking for ways to expand the work to India, where she was born and raised, but her efforts fell short.
“I was looking for places that would give me options to go to India to do trainings, but no one wants to take the foreigner who doesn't really know too much about the motherland,” she says. “They said ‘You don't know your way around here. You don't know anything. And you’re 16. How are you going to help out?' So I just got my start doing a bunch of little projects.”
A few years later, Shriya found a way to get the support she needed.
“It was during the pandemic,” she says. “Once classes moved virtual, I had a lot of free time on my hands. Someone on Facebook posted that the Miss India 2020 pageant was looking for competitors so I said ‘You know what? I'm just going to compete in a pageant.’”
She entered the pageant without any experience, coaching or training and placed first runner-up. That title earned her a spot in the Miss India America 2020 pageant. To her surprise, she was crowned the winner.
“I couldn’t believe it,” Shriya says. “It was the best year of my life. I loved it. And it opened so many doors that I decided to compete again.”
She went on to earn titles in several other pageants , including Miss Earth DC, Miss Grand US Virgin Islands and Miss Grand Christiansted.

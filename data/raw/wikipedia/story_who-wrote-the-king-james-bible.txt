“Let there be light.” “My brother’s keeper.” “Fight the good fight.” A number of the most well-known phrases in the English language originated not in novels, plays, or poems but in a seminal translation of the Bible , the King James Version (KJV), which was published in 1611 at the behest of King James I of England. It is likely the most famous translation of the bible and was the standard English Bible for nearly three centuries. Many people think that it’s so named because James had a hand in writing it, but that’s not the case. As king, James was also the head of the Church of England , and he had to approve of the new English translation of the Bible, which was also dedicated to him.
So if James didn’t write it, who did? To begin with, there’s no single author. One individual— Richard Bancroft , the archbishop of Canterbury —was notable for having the role of overseer of the project, something akin to a modern editor of a collection of short stories . The actual translating (writing) of the KJV was done by a committee of 47 scholars and clergymen over the course of many years. So we cannot say for certain which individual wrote a given passage.
One person who most assuredly did not write the KJV, although he had been long rumored to have done so, is William Shakespeare . There is no evidence that Shakespeare participated in the project, and, while both his works and the KJV are among the greatest literary feats of all time, his elaborate metaphor-heavy style and that of the KJV (which has minimalist and direct text) are vastly different. Moreover, there is little reason to believe that a group of 17th-century religious leaders would welcome a prominent playwright into their midst when theater at the time was widely thought—by devout Britons, at least—to be immoral .

Academic Calendar Approval Process
Annually in early October, the University Registrar begins the review process for the three upcoming academic year calendars by following Carnegie Mellon’s prearranged guidelines. The process is as follows:
The calendar for the next academic year (previously published as proposed ) is reviewed so that it may be approved as official;
The calendar for one academic year out (previously published as tentative ) is reviewed so that it may be considered as proposed;
The calendar for two academic years out is created so that it may be considered as tentative.
After the University Registrar’s review, the academic calendars are shared with the Provost and Vice President and Dean of Students for sign-off before approval and adoption by the University Leadership Council in November.
Once approved and adopted, the academic calendars are published to The HUB website. A notification email is sent by the University Registrar to the global university community no later than one week after approval.

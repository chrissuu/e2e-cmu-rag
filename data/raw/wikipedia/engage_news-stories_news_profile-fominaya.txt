The mural includes interactive elements that allow for text to be swapped out in different languages over time, fostering ongoing conversations about hospitality and inclusivity. A.B. hopes the piece will encourage reflection on how we interact with unfamiliar spaces and people, particularly in today’s global context of war, migration and displacement.
The project began in summer 2023, with the final design being solidified that November. A.B. utilized a pen plotter, a machine that uses pens to draw on paper with speed and precision. She incorporated techniques from embroidery software and printmaking to achieve her vision.
She says the project represents a convergence of her interests in art, technology and cultural expression. And she found a supportive community at CMU, particularly within the LCAL department.
“The Department of Languages, Cultures & Applied Linguistics provided me with a community at Carnegie Mellon University,” she says. “It’s really cool that I got to work with them to create this art installation.”
“In the Footsteps of a Stranger” serves as a tangible reminder of the power of art to provoke thought and dialogue. As it hangs on the walls of the third floor of Posner Hall, it serves as a reminder of the beauty that lies in embracing the unknown and extending a hand of welcome to those who walk in the footsteps of a stranger.

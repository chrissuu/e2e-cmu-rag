The Corcovado National Park in southwest Costa Rica - this is the richest ecosystem in Central America. Seventy-five percent of all species native to the rainforest live up here in the trees. The Corcovado National Park is the Garden of Eden for more than 1 million plant and animal species. Around a tenth of America's mammals are native to the park - anteaters, capuchins and four other monkey species. The rainforest is also home to macaws, leafcutter ants and even pumas and jaguars roam free. And there are over 400 species of birds to be seen. Corcovado is one of the most remote and least visited National Parks in Costa Rica. Founded in 1975, the park comprises more than 45 square kilometers of rainforest and is situated on the Osa Peninsula in the far southwest of Costa Rica. A complex ecosystem that often appears to be in a state of chaos - a huge, green ocean. In reality, though, this forest consists of numerous layers, each on offering refuge for different species. In the words of American anthropologist Paul Richards "a place for everything and everything in its place." The Corcovado National Park, a living example of how quickly nature can be restored to its original condition once humans leave it to its own devices. In fact, this luscious expanse of flora and fauna, until the park was established in 1975, was simply farmland.

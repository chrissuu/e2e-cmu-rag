Festivals
To complement its mainstage presentations, The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust produces a number of festivals to celebrate the performing arts in its many forms, often in unique places and spaces. From its country festivals—such as the Distinctively Dutch Festival showcasing a range of contemporary work that is reflective of today’s Dutch culture—to the Pittsburgh International Children's Festival to First Night Pittsburgh and the Three Rivers Arts Festival, the Trust is committed to showcasing local arts and artists while bringing the very best the world has to offer to our region.

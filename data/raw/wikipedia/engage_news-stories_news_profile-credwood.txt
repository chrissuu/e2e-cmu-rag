Rehearsing for Success
Carter considered the theater his second home growing up, a venue to soak up information like how to run a lightboard or soundboard, change scenery and glean advice from seasoned veterans like his mentor Mark Clayton Southers .
He became the “go-to kid” when anyone in the Pittsburgh arts scene needed someone under age 18 for a role and participated in nearly every youth arts competition, mastering everything from Shakespeare to August Wilson.
Carter soon set his sights on New York City, but his mom had another idea.
“I was a small kid with big dreams,” Carter says. “But my mom was like ‘Would you let a doctor operate on you that had no formal training? Why not go get formal training and the credentials? You might not need it, but why not have it.’”
So he signed up for CMU’s Pre-College Program following his junior year of high school, next door to his home in Pittsburgh’s Hill District neighborhood.
Carter says that summer opened his eyes to the possibilities of a CMU education.
“They were people from all over the world talking about how this was their top school,” Carter says. “I remember being taken aback because even though it was in my backyard, I never really considered CMU for drama. I only knew it for engineering and computer science.”
Once on campus as a student, he absorbed every lesson regardless of how rigorous and relentless his schedule.
“You’re always on the go and have almost no time,” Carter says. “You’re just going from being physical in movement class to training your voice in vocal to acting class where you get more emotional and technical to stage combat to classical texts with Shakespeare and Greek.”
“It is intense. I know for a fact that those long days then prepared me for the long days now.”

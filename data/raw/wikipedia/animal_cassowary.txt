cassowary ,  (genus Casuarius ),  any of several species of large flightless birds of the Australo-Papuan region. Cassowaries are the only members of the family Casuariidae and belong to the order Casuariiformes , which also includes the emu . There are three species (counted by some experts as six), each with several races. The common , or southern, cassowary, Casuarius casuarius , which inhabits New Guinea , nearby islands, and Australia , is the largest—almost 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall—and has two long red wattles on the throat. The dwarf cassowary ( C. bennetti ) is native to higher elevations of New Guinea and can also be found on the island of New Britain , and the northern cassowary ( C. unappendiculatus ) inhabits New Guinea’s northern lowlands.
The body is black in adults and is brownish in immature birds . Its naked blue head is protected by a bony helmet, or casque. The female lays three to six green eggs , each of which is about 13 cm (5 inches) long and weighs 650 grams (23 ounces). The male incubates those for about 50 days in a leafy nest on the ground and may provide most of the early care of the striped young. Cassowaries forage for fruits and small animals .
The cassowary has been known to kill human beings with slashing blows of its feet, as the innermost of its three toes bears a long daggerlike nail . The bird has been observed to move rapidly along narrow tracks in the bush, sprinting as fast as 50 km (31 miles) per hour.

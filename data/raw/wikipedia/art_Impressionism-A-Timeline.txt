The Impressionists staged their first exhibition in Paris in 1874 amid a transforming landscape—quite literally, as the French capital had just undergone a years-long reconstruction (1853–70) to modernize the medieval city. The country, too, was shifting. Its loss in the Franco-German War (1870–71) led to the establishment of the Third Republic , France’s seventh form of government since the start of the Revolution in 1789 .
Art was also being redefined, with such Realist painters as Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet rejecting prevailing academic traditions and depicting without finish or embellishment ordinary people doing everyday activities. Rebuffed from the Salon —the only major public event at which artists could show their work—both painters were thus compelled to organize their own exhibitions independent of the establishment. Their art and subversion inspired the Impressionists, who boycotted the Salon in 1874 and organized that first exhibition.

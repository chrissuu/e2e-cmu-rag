With more than 7 million square feet across our global footprint, physical space is one of Carnegie Mellon’s most important assets. CMU's enterprise space initiative aims to maximize the use and management of our buildings and spaces.
Space Strategy
We collect enormous amounts of data about our physical spaces. How can we ensure that this information supports the priorities of our people going forward, while continuing to advance the goals of the university? The enterprise space initiative will create both university-wide and departmentally focused strategies for our physical environment. A cross-campus Enterprise Space Advisory Council will work with our enterprise space teams to help CMU leaders identify the data they need to make informed decisions about using our spaces.
Data and Technology to Support Space Decision-Making
Carnegie Mellon is also updating and consolidating its space-related data processes and technology to provide consistent, detailed information to space decision-makers across the university as they manage their physical environments. This data – including b uilding/floor/room layouts, c ampus maps, s pace ownership and usage, and r oom assets and capabilities – is managed by the enterprise space teams, with guidance from the Enterprise Space Decision Review Board . Learn more about Carnegie Mellon's Enterprise Space Information Management (ESIM) function and the ESIM services available to the CMU community.

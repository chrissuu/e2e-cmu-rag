Situated in the heart of the Point Breeze, Frick Park is known as Pittsburghâ€™s largest historical regional park. Originally 151 acres, the land was passed on to the city from Henry Clay Frick in 1919. The park officially opened in 1927 after more land was acquired. Now, at 644 acres, Frick Park is Pittsburgh's largest historic regional park. If you are an avid bird watcher, you can enjoy over 100 species of birds in the area. The park also features red clay tennis courts, baseball fields, a dog park, and the only public lawn bowling green in Pennsylvania.

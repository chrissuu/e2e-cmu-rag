For Colleen McMullen , executive director of community and inclusion at Tepper School of Business , paying forward her good fortune is nothing new. She is a firm believer in giving back in its many forms, from monetary gifts to the sharing of resources and experiences.
During her childhood, Colleen learned the importance of giving from her parents, and as she continued into adulthood and her career, that spirit of philanthropy has remained central.
“Philanthropy was an important part of growing up. In African American families, philanthropy starts in faith communities,” she says. “And it’s all about how we can support initiatives that help and assist others.”
A 30-year veteran of higher education, Colleen knows that providing a quality education is a community effort, and that’s why Giving CMU Day is near and dear to her heart.
“At every university where I’ve worked, I’ve always thought it was important to not only give my time as an employee, but look for initiatives that speak to my values and help students do more and engage further,” she says.
As part of the diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at Tepper, she is frequently approached by students who want to attend a conference or competition or bring in a speaker. Often, her budget can’t stretch to accommodate these requests on short notice.
“I wanted to figure out how I could create a resource that would support these initiatives and help students seize opportunities,” Colleen says. “After some research, I decided to create the Community and Inclusion Fund, and now, I commit my whole day on Giving CMU Day to promote that cause.”
“I spend the day on LinkedIn and reaching to my connections to support something I know is so important to the CMU community.”

Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical engineers create and integrate the physical connections we use to interact with the world around us. Join us in discipline-crossing work, like bio-inspired soft robotics, stretchable electronics for human-machine interfaces, synthetic DNA to build nanoscale devices, and optimized 3D printing of metal components. Take part in world-bettering projects like low-cost sensors to monitor air pollution in underserved communities, energy-dense batteries for electric flight, and more environmentally-sustainable techniques for producing ceramic materials. You’ll learn to analyze situations and solve practical problems by converting concepts into reliable, cost-effective devices and processes. You’ll also apply machine learning and data science tools to inform your solutions. With a Mechanical Engineering degree, you’ll be able to design, analyze and manufacture innovative products and technologies. The curriculum emphasizes collaborative problem solving, hands-on experience and technical skills.

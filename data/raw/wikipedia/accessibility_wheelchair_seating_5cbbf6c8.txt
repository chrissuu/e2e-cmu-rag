Heinz Hall is committed to making our performances and facilities available to all of our patrons.
Accessible Seating is available at all Heinz Hall shows
If a wheelchair location is desired, please notify the ticket service representative at the time of purchase. This will help us ensure that the fixed seat can be removed prior to your arrival at the theater. Doormen and ushers are available for assistance at every performance.
If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call Heinz Hall directly 412.392.4900.

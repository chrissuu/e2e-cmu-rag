WYEP is bringing more free live music to the Pittsburgh region this year, with our Neighborhood Concert Series!
For each show in the Neighborhood Concert Series, we’ll be partnering with venues and community organizations to host Pittsburgh-based bands, as well as up-and-coming national artists. And because the series will be in all different communities, it’s a great opportunity for you, friends and family to explore a new place and hear some incredible music!

As the city’s supporter and promoter for the arts, the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council keeps a pulse on the arts and culture community by way of advocacy, grant-making, professional development and research. Our city has more than 500 arts organizations of varying disciplines – museums and galleries, performing arts and theaters, music groups and venues, cultural institutions and much more.
Spending by Allegheny County's nonprofit arts and culture organizations and their audiences totaled $1.3 billion. In fact, according to the latest study, Arts and Economic Prosperity 6 , in 2022 Allegheny County arts and cultural assets drive greater economic activity than the median in the comparative set.
While it’s clear that Pittsburgh is at no loss for major art institutions, it’s the independent artists that make these institutions and our neighborhoods shine. From writers to vibrant performing artists to visual and street artists who aren’t afraid to pair their practice to support social causes, Pittsburgh offers an incredible creative experience for those looking.
We invite you to explore the careers and work of some of Pittsburgh’s best emerging artists who continue to make their mark on the city and industry.

Graduate and Professional Student Appreciation Week
Graduate and Professional Student Appreciation Week was launched in 1993 by student members of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS). Celebrated nationally each year during the first week of April, the event seeks to recognize and celebrate the contributions, impact, and value of graduate and professional students on campuses throughout the United States.
During this week, the Office of the Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs and many partners across the Pittsburgh campus hold a variety of events to celebrate CMU's graduate and professional students. Our graduate and professional students are cordially invited to participate!
Thank you to everyone who attended the 2025 Graduate and Professional Student Appreciation Week! Please check back next year for the 2026 event details and schedule.

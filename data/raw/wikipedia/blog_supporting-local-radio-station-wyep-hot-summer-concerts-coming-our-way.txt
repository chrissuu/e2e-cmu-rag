In news that’s certainly music to our ears, this spring and summer will feature eight free shows — part of the station’s brand-new Neighborhood Concert Series that brings live music to various Pittsburgh-area pockets. Felix explains that when the station celebrated its 50th anniversary, they wanted to do something fun for the community. “We started a Live Music Fund that was specifically aimed at raising money to support Pittsburgh’s live music ecosystem,” she says, “and the Neighborhood Concert Series is one way that we’re putting that fund into action. The idea is that the station brings free live music from local and national artists to different parts of the Pittsburgh region where WYEP traditionally hasn’t done events.”
The lineup includes artists making music in Pittsburgh that radio staff happen to love, like Merce Lemon and Animal Scream (who played the first series show they held in April). Others like Clover County, Snacktime and Kashus Culpepper are up-and-coming artists they’ve been playing on the station to generate interest. “And then we’ve got some longtime favorites, like Nick Lowe and Chuck Prophet,” Felix says. “So it’s a mix of different venues and music styles. We’re basically choosing artists from different genres and different places in their career trajectories, much like we do on the air every day on WYEP.”

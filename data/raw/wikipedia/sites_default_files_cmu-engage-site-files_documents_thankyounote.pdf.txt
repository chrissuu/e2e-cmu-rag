Thank You Note Sample
Alumni, parents and friends are given the option to make a gift to the network as they register for events. If you are
hosting an event for the network, your CMUAA staff partner will provide a full list those that have pre-registered for
the event, which differs from the online attendance list for the event. The list provided will include contact
information for those that have registered and their giving information for the specific event. If your CMUAA staff
partner indicates that a gift has been made, or you see the gift on your list, you will want to reach out directly with a
personalized thank you note. The peer-to-peer recognition and thank you makes a huge impact.

Subject: Thank You for Making a Gift to our Network
Dear NAME,
Thank you for making a gift to the network during the registration process for Event Name. Your gift comes
directly to the network so that we can continue to host more events like this for our alumni, parents,
students and friends in the region. You should receive an official tax form from CMU, but I wanted to
personally thank you on behalf of the network.
I look forward to meeting you tomorrow/ this weekend/ etc. at the event.
Best,
Your Name and Indicia

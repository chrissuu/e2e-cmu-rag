Welcome
Welcome to the website for official University Policies. A University Policy is a rule that has been officially sanctioned by the president of Carnegie Mellon University and that generally has university-wide applicability. A Policy may include governing principles, it may either mandate or constrain action, it may ensure compliance with laws, or it may mitigate the university's risk. Broadly, a Policy is either academic or administrative in scope and application and must be approved by the president (and Board of Trustees as required), in order to become official University Policy. This site serves as a repository of current Policies and provides information about new, revised and, upon request, decommissioned Policies.

I've been fortunate enough to see titans of the magician industry like David Copperfield, Criss Angel and Penn & Teller live, and have had a lifelong appreciation for magic my entire life. And I can tell you with certainty that seeing just one magician at Liberty Magic is going to be a transformative experience.
Seated in an intimate, 66-seat theatre, the show at Liberty Magic is personal, making the feats you're about to see feel that much more special. Performances feel more like a longform play interspersed with up-close magic.
Magicians take the time to get to know their audience, using volunteers as assistants and changing up which illusions are performed on a night-by-night basis based on your reactions. Seated just feet from the magician, I felt as if I was seeing a world-class entertainer who was there just for me.
Several times throughout my latest visit, the magician gave permission to the audience to enjoy the show the way we wanted to. He welcomed skeptics and those new to magic just like anyone else. I urge you to look around after a big moment and savor the reactions you'll find from fellow theatregoers: some people with eyes and mouths wide open, others shaking their heads in disbelief, some laughing and others with furrowed brows trying to figure out what just happened.

What is the role of a label in 2025? How do you get on their radars to get signed? What are the pros and cons of big, major labels and small, indie labels? How do you start your own? This session will cover the world of music labels in the present day and help musicians engage with them with agency. Guest speakers: Melanie Sheehan (US General Manager, Rough Trade Records) and Joyce Lim (1432r).
Fourth River, a collaboration between Honcho PGH and The Rising Artist Foundation, is proud to present our FREE Public Music Industry Seminars, every Saturday from Oct. 11 to Nov. 15 at Wood Street Galleries. Named in homage to the city's underground, essential aquifer, this program will help artists nourish and navigate their creative careers with clarity. Each week, we'll present different topics with leading guest speakers to help demystify the music industry for rising music makers.
Advance RSVP via Resident Advisor is required to attend.

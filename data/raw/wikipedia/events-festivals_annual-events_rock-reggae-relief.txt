This multi-event celebration, anchored by the main festival on August 2nd at Stage AE , combines world-class music with community support. Hosted by the Piatt Family Foundation , the series includes free pop-up concerts in June and July, and a kick off party culminating in the main event. This year’s beneficiary is Pittsburgh Scholar House – empowering single parents to pursue higher education and create better futures for their families. Join us for a season of beats, unity, and positive change in the heart of Pittsburgh!

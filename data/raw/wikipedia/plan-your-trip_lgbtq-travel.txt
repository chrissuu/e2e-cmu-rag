Pittsburgh is home to a thriving arts and culture and scene. A visit to The Andy Warhol Museum is a must. Explore decades of artworks and collections of the Pittsburgh-native Andy Warhol, who openly expressed his queer identity and life in art. And, be sure to make time to explore the Mattress Factory , a unique, contemporary art museum that features site-specific installations, like the late Greer Lankton’s It’s all about ME, Not You. Lankton is remembered for eloquently exploring and questioning the norms of gender and sexuality.

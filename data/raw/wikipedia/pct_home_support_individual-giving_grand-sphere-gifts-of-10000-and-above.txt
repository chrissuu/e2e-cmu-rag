Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Grand Sphere Major Donor Program
Crafting a Cultural Legacy
Embrace the Spotlight. Elevate the Impact.
The Grand Sphere beckons cultural visionaries to experience the magic of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust in a transformative way. This exclusive program, designed for donors who contribute $10,000 or more annually, offers unparalleled access, fosters meaningful connections, and allows them to directly shape the artistic landscape of Pittsburgh.
Tailored to Their Passions: We understand that Grand Sphere philanthropistsâ€™ passions are unique. The Grand Sphere goes beyond one-size-fits-all, and we invite them to collaborate with our team to curate a personalized experience that aligns with their interests and giving level. Together, we will craft a custom package that reflects their vision and maximizes their impact on the arts. Donors who support the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust at the Grand Sphere levels will always be able to enjoy access to the Circles Lounges in the Benedum Center, including complimentary beverages and one-on-one assistance with ticketing requests from our dedicated Donor Concierge Specialist.
Please contact Major Gifts Officer, Heather Masterson ( masterson@trustarts.org or 412-471-3519) to learn more about the Grand Sphere and how you can join this visionary group.

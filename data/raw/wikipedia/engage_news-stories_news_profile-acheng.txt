Curiosity Takes the Controls
Annie received a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a minor in business administration from the University of British Columbia in 2002.
From there, she started looking for a graduate program that combined both of her interests. She chose the yearlong master of information systems management program through Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy .
“CMU was a perfect fit for me,” Annie says. “I liked the aspect of learning how to use technology to solve problems and understanding how the technology enables better business.”
After completing the program in 2003, Annie weighed her options for the future.
“I was looking at the world with bright, wide eyes trying to figure out what I wanted to do,” Annie says. “I ended up in trading on Wall Street, and I loved it for a while.”
Eventually, she wanted to explore new horizons.
“I started wondering what I could contribute to the world,” Annie says. “I was reading a lot on the side, and I started falling in love with airplanes. I was never exposed to aviation before that, so I decided to take a course.”
Annie enrolled in an online course through the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
“That’s when I realized aviation was something I could do,” she says. “I had an engineering background and knew that I could learn it.”
Annie went on to receive a master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics engineering from Purdue University. In 2008, she started her first job in the aviation industry as an aviation consultant.

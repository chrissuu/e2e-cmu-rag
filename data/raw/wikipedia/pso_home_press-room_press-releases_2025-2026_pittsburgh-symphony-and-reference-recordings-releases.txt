A DEEPLY PERSONAL INTERPRETATION FROM MANFRED HONECK AND
THE PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, FEATURING F. MURRAY ABRAHAM AS NARRATOR.
REFERENCE RECORDINGS® proudly presents the beloved Requiem of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, in a very special interpretation.
Academy Award® and Golden Globe®­winning film and Broadway star F. Murray Abraham joins Manfred Honeck and the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for Honeck’s dramatic conception of “Requiem: Mozart’s Death in Words and Music.” Over a
decade ago, Honeck contemporized Mozart’s epic masterpiece by incorporating text into the score. F. Murray Abraham, Manfred
Honeck, and the Orchestra previously performed “Requiem: Mozart’s Death in Words and Music” at Heinz Hall in 2012 and at
Carnegie Hall in 2014. This album was recorded live in 2023 in beautiful and historic Heinz Hall, home of the Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra, in superb audiophile sound. Maestro Honeck honors us again with his peerless music notes, in which he gives us great
insight into his musical interpretation of Mozart’s final, iconic work.
“We are so thrilled that the exceptional artist F. Murray Abraham will return to Pittsburgh to collaborate again with Manfred Honeck
and the Pittsburgh Symphony on what promises to be an extraordinary concert weekend,” said Melia Tourangeau, president and CEO
of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. “Manfred Honeck’s interpretation of Mozart’s Requiem is a very special one that includes
traditional Austrian death bells, Gregorian chant, and conveys both solace and hope.”
Known for a wide range of roles on stage and screen, the highly acclaimed F. Murray Abraham won the Academy Award® for Best Actor
for his role as Italian composer Antonio Salieri in the film Amadeus, which fictionalized a relationship between Salieri and Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart. Abraham starred in the critically acclaimed series Homeland, for which he received two Emmy® nominations.
Abraham recently starred in the HBO hit television series The White Lotus for which he received a Golden Globe® nomination.
Now in its 130th season, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is credited with a rich history of engaging the world’s finest conductors
and musicians, and is deeply committed to the Pittsburgh region and citizens. Since 2008, the Orchestra has been led by Manfred
Honeck, its internationally renowned Music Director. The Orchestra has always been at the forefront; championing new works and has a

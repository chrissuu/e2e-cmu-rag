Interestingly, binge-watchers often have a heightened sense of empathy. You might think spending hours absorbed in fictional narratives would disconnect someone from reality, but the opposite is often true.
Binge-watchers regularly engage with complex characters and emotionally charged storylines. This constant exposure to different perspectives and situations can sharpen their ability to understand and share the feelings of others.
It’s like a form of emotional exercise, flexing the empathy muscles over and over again. The more they watch, the more they learn about human emotions, relationships, and experiences.
This can translate into real-world empathy, making them more understanding and compassionate towards the people around them.
So next time you press play on that next episode, remember: You’re not just a binge-watcher. You’re an empathetic storyteller, a lover of narratives, a seeker of connection in an often disconnected world. And there’s something beautiful about that.
Here’s to embracing who we are, in all our binge-watching glory!

“Bingeing – the act of unrestrained and excessive indulgence – is nothing new. In fact, it exemplifies an age-old human desire to be completely immersed in story.
Far from being a new behaviour spawned by the digital age, bingeing is rooted in human history....
Bingeing today is often accompanied by feelings of guilt and unproductiveness. This seems to reflect, more than anything else, a shift in societal values regarding leisure time.
At some points in the past, prolonged engagement with stories would have been seen by certain groups as a valuable cultural activity – one that contributes to personal enrichment and social interaction.
For instance, the European Enlightenment movement of the 17th and 18th centuries encouraged people to develop a critical view of the world through as much self-education as possible. This approach to learning was thought to foster intellectual freedom and happiness, and often involved extensive engagement with written works.
Across time and cultures, humans have sought to escape reality and engage emotionally with stories. From ancient oral traditions, to modern streaming, our desire for continuous narrative consumption has remained constant.
Perhaps by recognising this historical precedent, we can come to appreciate our love of bingeing – and not feel so bad about it after all.

Liu began his musical life at the age of six with intense study of the erhu — a two-stringed Chinese musical instrument. Taking the advice of his family, he switched to the cello, with the newly available study of western music. The erhu has always held a special place in his heart, as it represents his childhood and country of birth. He enjoys playing the erhu in his spare time.

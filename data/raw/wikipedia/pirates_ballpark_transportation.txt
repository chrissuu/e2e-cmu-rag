Millions of fans have visited PNC Park since it opened in April 2001. Through the years, the city of Pittsburgh -- and especially the North Shore -- has continued to change and grow. While the ongoing development of our region is exciting, it also presents fans with some challenges in getting to and from the ballpark.

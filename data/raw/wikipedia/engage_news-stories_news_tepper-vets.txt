Carnegie Mellon University alumnus Daniel Leonard had a serious question for his good friends and fellow alumni Ronnie Bush and Kyle Eberly, all graduates and supporters of the Tepper School of Business.
Couldn’t they make a greater impact together, creating and raising funds for an endowed fellowship, a gift that would continue and grow over time?
Ronnie and Kyle readily agreed, and the three made multiyear commitments — creating the Tepper BELL (Bush, Eberly, Leonard Leadership) Veterans Fellowship, dedicated to assisting MBA students who are U.S. Army veterans like themselves.
While the G.I. Bill and Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program can help, many veterans don’t have full access to these education benefits.
“There should be no veteran who can’t go to Tepper because of funds — that’s the goal,” says Daniel, a former Army captain who graduated in 2017 with his MBA. He works in transportation and logistics investment banking as a vice president with Harris Williams and is an alumni reunion co-chair for his class.

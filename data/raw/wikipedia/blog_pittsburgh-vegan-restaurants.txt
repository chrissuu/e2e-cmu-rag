You'll see Pittsburgh Juice Company (or the PJC) and their signature bottles being carried by bikers, in strollers and by Pittsburghers of all ages, and one sip will tell you why. Their juices are as fresh as it gets, cold-pressed daily from whole, organic fruits, vegetables and superfoods.
Daily favorites here are the Witch's Brew , first developed for a movie crew back in 2014, pressed with cucumber, granny smith apple, kale and ginger and a variety of raw vegan fare to grab-n-go with parfaits, pestos and more.

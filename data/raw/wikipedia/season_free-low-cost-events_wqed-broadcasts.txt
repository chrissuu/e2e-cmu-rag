WQED-FM radio broadcasts are the perfect way to catch up on the past and upcoming seasons of Pittsburgh Opera.
WQED-FM broadcasts each of Pittsburgh Opera's previous-season productions, in their entirety, in the weeks leading up to our new season's opening night. If a production was sold out, or you just want to hear your favorite arias again, WQED-FM's broadcasts are a great way to hear these performances. See the schedule below for details.
Hosted by WQED’s Anna Singer, the Pittsburgh Opera Preview Shows are half-hour previews of each upcoming opera . Each 30-minute Preview Show is broadcast twice before each production opens (the Saturday before opening night, and again the night before opening night), giving listeners an in-depth introduction to the opera’s singers, music, and production.

Introduce your child to a lifelong love of music.
Since 1991, generations of Pittsburgh families have trusted Fiddlesticks to introduce kids ages 3-8 to music through these fun and imaginative musical adventures.
These Saturday concerts in Heinz Hall are filled with musical fun in a relaxed, welcoming, and interactive environment and are recommended for families with children ages three to eight. Fiddlesticks, your musical ambassador, and guest vocalist Katy Williams will guide you through these musical adventures! Pre-concert activities begin at 10:00 A.M.
Fiddlesticks concerts promote curiosity, togetherness, and music-making in a fun environment.
What kind of ambassador is seven feet tall, covered in fur, and surprisingly cuddly? It’s Fiddlesticks – a musical cat who, for 35 amazing years, has been introducing children to the magic of music and the orchestra. Fiddlesticks loves meeting his fans after each performance in the Grand Lobby of Heinz Hall. He especially enjoys hearing about how fun the concerts are, with their audience participation elements, the “just-right” length (only about 45 minutes), and the warm, welcoming atmosphere created by everyone involved! And of course, he loves hearing how much they enjoyed the music!

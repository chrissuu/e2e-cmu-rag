Time Elapsed: 1 hour, 5 minutes
See how compact a lot of our city is? You're now in our sports stadium area and have effectively went from southern to northern neighborhoods. Coming off the switchback from the bridge, head right towards PNC Park , the baseball stadium, and pick up the trail right along the water as you pass iconic monuments and baseball history .
From here, you'll bike along the water for about 10 more minutes before crossing your final bridge, the Sixteenth Street Bridge, depositing you in the Strip District. Non-bikers, don't worry. The 86, 87 and 88 busses leave from Downtown to the Strip every 10 minutes, keeping you on time for this segment.

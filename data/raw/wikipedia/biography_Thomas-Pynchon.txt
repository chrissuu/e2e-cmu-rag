Thomas Pynchon (born May 8, 1937, Glen Cove, Long Island , New York , U.S.) is an American novelist and short-story writer whose works combine black humor and fantasy to depict human alienation in the chaos of modern society. His 1973 novel Gravity’s Rainbow is widely considered to be among the greatest works of American literature . Of his impact on contemporary literature, fellow novelist Don DeLillo once said, “It was as though Hemingway died one day and Pynchon was born the next. And fiction changed in that manner, abruptly, from pure realism to something more cosmic.” Notoriously reclusive, Pynchon has never granted an interview or participated in literary events. Indeed, one of the few published photographs of him comes from his high school yearbook.
V. and The Crying of Lot 49
In 1963 Pynchon won the Faulkner Foundation Award for his first novel, V. (1963), a whimsical, cynically absurd tale of a middle-aged Englishman’s search for “V.,” an elusive supernatural adventuress appearing in various guises at critical periods in European history . In his next book, The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), Pynchon described a woman’s strange quest to discover the mysterious, conspiratorial Tristero System in a futuristic world of closed societies. The novel serves as a condemnation of modern industrialization .

Gravity’s Rainbow
Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow is a tour de force in 20th-century literature . In exploring the dilemmas of human beings in the modern world, the story, which is set in an area of post- World War II Germany called “the Zone,” centers on the wanderings of an American soldier who is one of many odd characters looking for a secret V-2 rocket that will supposedly break through Earth ’s gravitational barrier when launched. The narrative is filled with descriptions of obsessive and paranoid fantasies, ridiculous and grotesque imagery, and esoteric mathematical and scientific language. For his efforts, Pynchon received the National Book Award , and many critics deemed Gravity’s Rainbow a visionary apocalyptic masterpiece. Scenes from the novel were adapted as part of the German film Prüfstand VII (2002).
Vineland , Inherent Vice , and other novels
Pynchon’s next novel, Vineland —which begins in 1984 in California —was not published until 1990. Two vast, complex historical novels followed. In Mason & Dixon (1997), set in the 18th century, Pynchon took the English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon as his subject, and Against the Day (2006) moves from the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 through World War I . Inherent Vice (2009), Pynchon’s rambling take on the detective novel , returns to the California counterculture milieu of Vineland . It was made into a film by Paul Thomas Anderson in 2014; Anderson’s 2025 film One Battle After Another is a loose adaptation of Vineland .
Bleeding Edge (2013) chronicles the efforts of a fraud investigator to untangle the nefarious doings of a New York computer-security firm in the year leading up to the September 11 attacks of 2001, all the while attempting to parent her children in the wake of domestic difficulties.
Shadow Ticket
In 2025 Pynchon published Shadow Ticket , a Prohibition -era novel set in 1930s Milwaukee that follows Hicks McTaggart, a private eye tasked with tracking down a missing cheese heiress. Soon enough, McTaggart winds up in Europe, where he uncovers a conspiracy involving fraud, fascism , and “the Al Capone of Cheese.” Although some critics considered the novel less dazzling compared to Pynchon’s other works, the book received favorable reviews. In The Washington Post , critic Jacob Brogan wrote , “Of all living novelists, Pynchon may have the most distinct voice—a clipped tough-guy patois delivered with the rhythms of borscht belt comedy, amplified by an endless appetite for linguistic play—that has proved largely inimitable.” Brogan also noted, “It’s not just that no one else writes quite like Pynchon; it’s that no one even tries.”
Short stories
Of Pynchon’s few short stories, most notable are “ Entropy” (1960), a neatly structured tale in which Pynchon first uses extensive technical language and scientific metaphors , and “ The Secret Integration” (1964), a story in which Pynchon explores small-town bigotry and racism . The collection Slow Learner (1984) contains “The Secret Integration.”

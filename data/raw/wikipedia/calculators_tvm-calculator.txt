Whether you’re borrowing for a home, car, or an education, investing in a CD, looking at stock
                    market returns,
                    or considering an annuity, it all depends on the same basic formula: the time value of money.
A calculator for the time value of money consists of five basic inputs.
Future value: The estimated value of a current asset at a specified future
                        date, based on
                        the rate of return.
Present value: The value of an expected sum of money, discounted by
                        compounding interest
                        rates to the present day.
Interest rate or rate of return: This may be a nominal rate, or the “real”
                        rate, which
                        accounts for inflation.
Time: Can also be expressed as the number of periods from start to finish.
Payments: Could be contributions to an investment account or payments on a
                        loan.
Using the calculator, you can answer pretty much any money math question by adding in all but
                    one variable and
                    “solving for X.” Once you’ve mastered the relationship between money and time, you can make
                    saving, investing,
                    and borrowing decisions with an extra dose of confidence.

What to Expect
Penny Arcade was designed to include activities and subject matter appropriate for kids aged 4 to 8 — the experience is a fun, goofy time for everyone in the room! Through games and activities, guests will learn about the foundations of improv comedy: collaboration, support, and listening. Kids can hop up and interact with the performers, use their imaginations, and get silly. By the end of the show, every guest is a “Penny Player” and has the opportunity to engage with the show and unleash their sense of humor! While we encourage everyone in the room to engage with the production, it’s not a requirement. Children are encouraged to do what’s most comfortable for them. There are moments when everyone will be sitting down watching a live comedy performance, and when we’re all dancing and moving about the space. Quiet rooms will also be available if a family needs to step out and take a break.

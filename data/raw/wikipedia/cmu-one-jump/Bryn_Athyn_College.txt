Bryn Athyn College is a private Christian college in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, United States. It is affiliated with the General Church of the New Jerusalem.

Bryn Athyn College started educating undergraduates after its incorporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1877. Then known as the Academy of the New Church, in 1890, the academy established a separate organization, the General Church of the New Jerusalem, a religious body based on the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. After receiving an endowment from John Pitcairn and others, the Academy of the New Church expanded from a seminary into a high school and a two-year college. In 1914, it became a four-year college, and by 1922, the college was also conferring Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. In 1997, the Academy of the New Church College adopted a new name: Bryn Athyn College of the New Church.[2]

In August 2008, the college opened several new student residence cottages. A new science center and a new admissions and student life building were completed in September 2009.

The Case Western Reserve Spartans are the varsity intercollegiate athletic teams of Case Western Reserve University, located in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Case Western Reserve University competes at the NCAA Division III level. The Spartans compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA), except in football where the team competes as an associate member of the Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC). The university offers 19 sports—10 men's sports and 9 women's sports.

All 19 varsity teams wear a commemorative patch on their uniforms honoring Case alumnus, M. Frank Rudy, inventor of the Nike air-sole.[2]

The Spartans' primary athletic rival is Carnegie Mellon University.

The Case Western Reserve Spartans' heritage stems from the combination of two long and storied sports histories of Western Reserve University and Case Institute of Technology.

Case, originally known as Case School of Applied Science, carried the name Scientists from 1918 to 1939. In 1940, the mascot was changed to the Rough Riders, in honor of their head coach Ray A. Ride. Case formally updated its school name in 1947 to Case Institute of Technology.[3] Western Reserve originally used the mascot Pioneers from 1921 to 1927, until being forced to change by Marietta College, who claimed earlier usage of the namesake.[4] The famous Red Cats mascot was then used beginning in 1928. Upon the merger of the two schools, the Spartans name was adopted in 1970, as the team is now known.

In 1902, Case Tech and Western Reserve University were both founding members of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC). Western Reserve left the OAC in 1931 to compete as an independent, while Case Tech stayed in until 1948. Breaking away from independence looking to compete with larger schools, Western Reserve became a charter member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in 1946. After less than a decade, Western Reserve withdrew from the MAC in 1954, citing the need for the school to focus more energy on academics and less money and resources on athletics spearheaded by President John S. Millis.[5]

Returning to their roots of competing in the same conference, Case Tech and Western Reserve became founding members of the Presidents' Athletic Conference (PAC) in 1955. When the athletic departments of the two universities merged in 1971 they dominated the PAC for several years. The university remained a member of the PAC until 1983. In the fall of 1984 the university joined the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC), a pioneer in gender equality in sports, as a charter member. In conjunction with other top research universities in the country, Case Western Reserve became a charter member of University Athletic Association (UAA) in 1986, while maintaining joint conference membership affiliation with the NCAC until the 1998-1999 school year. In 2014 the football team, while maintaining membership in the UAA, began competing as an associate member of the PAC.

Fight On
Fight on, you men of Case Reserve 
Make foemen fear your strength and verve 
Display the old unflinching nerve— 
Go, Case Reserve, fight on! 
In days of yore in annual bout 
Across the fence, we fought it out 
The fence is down, today we shout: 
Go, Case Reserve, fight on! 
The blue and white team we'll uphold 
Old Case Reserve will never fold 
So, on to vict'ries yet untold 
Go, Case Reserve, fight on!

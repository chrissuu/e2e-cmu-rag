Charles Sturt University is an Australian multi-campus public university located in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. Established in 1989, it was named in honour of Captain Charles Sturt,[14] a British explorer who made expeditions into regional New South Wales and South Australia.

It is the largest regional university in Australia,[15] offering a multidisciplinary spectrum of courses in collaboration with various partners across the country.[16]

The university was established on 1 July 1989 from the merger of several existing separately-administered Colleges of Advanced Education by the Charles Sturt University Act 1989 (Act No. 76, 1989).[17]

The constituent colleges included the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst, the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education in Albury-Wodonga, and  in Wagga Wagga.[18]

The Riverina Murray Institute of Education operated between 1984 and 1989 in Albury-Wodonga and Wagga Wagga.[19][20] Its predecessor was the Riverina College of Advanced Education established in 1972 as a result of the reformation of Wagga Teachers' College and later merger with Wagga Agricultural College in 1976.[20] Wagga Teachers' College had been established in 1947 on the site of the former WW2 R.A.A.F. Hospital in the city of Wagga Wagga.[21][22] In September 1949 the Wagga Agricultural College was opened on the site of the Experiment Farm[23] established in October 1892 by the NSW Department of Agriculture with the first students commencing their studies in 1896.[24]

The Bathurst Teachers' College was officially opened in November 1951 with the first students commencing in March of that year. It was established on the site of the Bathurst Experiment Farm established in 1895 with the first students commencing their studies in March 1897.[25] Bathurst Teachers' College closed on 31 December 1967 and the Mitchell College of Advanced Education was established on 1 January 1970.[26]

Goulburn Teachers’ College opened on 1 July 1970 and became a CAE in 1974. It operated until 1982 when it was dissolved and became the Goulburn campus of Riverina College of Advanced Education. In December 1983 it was announced by the NSW State Government that a new Police Academy would be established on the Goulburn campus. In 1984 the Goulburn campus was vacated and the staff and students were transferred to the Albury and Wagga campuses of the Riverina College of Advanced Education together with its Commonwealth funded student places.

Charles Sturt established a Study Centre in Sydney[28] in 1998 and in Melbourne[29] in 2007. These Study Centres were operated by a private education group called Study Group Australia.[30] On 31 December 2022, Charles Sturt let its relationship with Study Group Australia expire. According to Charles Sturt's website, the Brisbane Study Centre is closed, and courses at the Sydney and Melbourne locations are in teach-out mode.[31]

In 1998, the Goulburn campus was established to deliver policing education to New South Wales Police.[16]

In 1999, the Dubbo campus foundation stone was laid. The university also launched its China Joint Cooperation Program with four universities[which?] in China.[citation needed]

On 1 January 2005, Charles Sturt  assumed control of its Orange campus. The Orange Agricultural College was established in 1973 as a part of the NSW Department of Agriculture. As a consequence of the reorganisation of higher education in the late 1980s, the college was linked with the University of New England in 1990, then amalgamated with the University of Sydney on 1 January 1994. Although a part of the university, it remained the Orange Agricultural College until it was restructured as the Faculty of Rural Management in 2000. In 2005 the faculty became a part of Charles Sturt University, operating on the old college site in Orange.[32] One of the conditions when the Department of Agriculture handed over  the Orange Agricultural College was that the land would be used for the purposes for which it was originally intended.[33]

Between 2005 and 2015, the university had expanded to include an offshore campus in Burlington, Ontario, in Canada.[34][35] In July 2015, Charles Sturt ceased to operate its Ontario campus due to the legislative and regulatory environment in Ontario.[36]

In 2005, Charles Sturt responded to the shortage of veterinarians in rural and regional Australia with the first veterinary science students starting their degrees at the Wagga Wagga campus.[citation needed] In 2008, the university also offered dentistry courses for the first time.[citation needed] This led to the development of five community-based clinics across its regional campuses.

On 14 February 2011, Charles Sturt University changed its logo. The Sturt's desert pea flower (Swainsona formosa) was stylised and made prominent, with the full name of the university as part of its logo.[37][38]

On 1 May 2012, a milestone was reached as the university opened a new campus in Port Macquarie, its first coastal regional campus, making higher education accessible to the Port Macquarie-Hastings region.[39]

In 2013, the university implemented a gas engine cogeneration power plant to help minimise fuel costs and carbon emissions.[40]

On 18 April 2016, staff and students at the Port Macquarie campus moved into the first stage of their purpose-built campus. The second stage was completed in 2020 and included a New South Wales emergency services training room, an innovation hub, and student support facilities. The third stage is scheduled for completion over the coming years, with an expected student intake of 5,000 by 2030.[citation needed]

On 28 July 2016, Charles Sturt was declared Australia's First Official Carbon Neutral University.[41] The Government of Australia's Carbon Neutral Program certified the university as "carbon neutral" against the National Carbon Offset Standard.

On 9 May 2018, Charles Sturt and Western Sydney University announced a partnership with the Australian Government's network to establish the Murray-Darling Medical School, providing joint medical programs across the Murray-Darling Basin region.[42] Charles Sturt's teaching base was established at the university's Orange campus to extend on the existing Western Sydney University program.[43]

In May 2019, for its 30th anniversary, the university announced its new branding and visual identity. This included a new crest that drew on the original coat of arms and the logos of its predecessor institutions. The crest's ochre design includes patterns that drawing on First Nation culture and symbolism echoing the landscapes of regional New South Wales, especially the Murray River of its founding campuses.[44]

On 29 May 2019, Charles Sturt University announced it joined the Regional Universities Network (RUN), becoming the seventh member of the group.[45]

In March 2021, Charles Sturt University's first medical students commenced study at the university's Orange campus as part of the Joint Program in Medicine with Western Sydney University. The Joint Program in Medicine is designed to train doctors in the regions to help address the shortfall in rural and regional medical professionals.[citation needed]

In 2022 the 50th Anniversary of the Riverina College of Advanced Education was celebrated, commencing with a Mayoral reception in the Wagga Art Gallery attended by the former College Principal and Registrar.[46] A preview of Neil Hall's book,Paradigm Shifts Riverina College of Advanced Education 1972–1986, was presented as part of the celebration.[47] It complements Portia Dilena's earlier account, Achieving Higher Education in Albury-Wodonga[48] and 2001 account by Blacklow, Boadle and Goldsworthy.[49]

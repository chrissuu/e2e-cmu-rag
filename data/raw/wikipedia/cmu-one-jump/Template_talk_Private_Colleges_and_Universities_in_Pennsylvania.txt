I've also left comments at User_talk:Flyguy33#Navboxes and Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Universities#Colleges and Universities in Pennsylvania. I wanted to point out WP:NAV and say that this template is really big, and I'd even go so far as to say too big. I'd also argue that no one would need a navbox for all the institutions of higher education in PA that a list couldn't handle better (see WP:CLN). Perhaps, as suggested by one of the guidelines, separates templates, like one for liberal arts colleges in PA or something, might be more manageable, though breaking up institutions of higher education by type can get dicey not only because definitions are so lax but also because type is often tied more to matters of status and prestige than utility. --Aepoutre (talk) 16:37, 16 March 2009 (UTC)[reply]

We might need to change the name of the template, too, now that it's not all "Colleges and Universities in Pennsylvania" and just "Private universities in Pennsylvania". See, for example, Template:Public universities in Pennsylvania. Its current organisation might also lend weight to my juco, college, and university & grad school idea above. --Aepoutre (talk) 05:49, 23 March 2009 (UTC)[reply]

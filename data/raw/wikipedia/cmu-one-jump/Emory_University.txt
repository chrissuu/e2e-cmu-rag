Emory University is a private research university in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It was founded in 1836 as Emory College by the Methodist Episcopal Church and named in honor of Methodist bishop John Emory.[18] Its main campus is in Druid Hills, four miles (six kilometers) from downtown Atlanta.[19]

Emory University comprises nine undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, including Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Goizueta Business School, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Oxford College, Emory University School of Medicine, Emory University School of Law, Rollins School of Public Health, Candler School of Theology, and Laney Graduate School. Emory University enrolls nearly 16,000 students from the U.S. and over 100 foreign countries.[20]

Emory Healthcare is the largest healthcare system in the state of Georgia[21] and comprises seven major hospitals, including Emory University Hospital and Emory University Hospital Midtown.[22] The university operates the Winship Cancer Institute, Emory National Primate Research Center, and many disease and vaccine research centers.[23][24] Emory University is adjacent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is a long-time partner in global and national prevention and research initiatives.[25] The International Association of National Public Health Institutes is headquartered at the university.[26] Emory University has the 15th-largest endowment among U.S. colleges and universities.[9] The university is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".[27] Emory University was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1995.[28]

Emory faculty and alumni include one Vice President of the United States, two Prime Ministers, two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, and a United States Supreme Court Justice. Other notable alumni include twenty-one Rhodes Scholars and six Pulitzer Prize winners. Emory has more than 165,000 alumni.

Emory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia, by the Methodist Episcopal Church.[29] The college was named in honor of the departed Methodist bishop John Emory.[29] Ignatius Alphonso Few was the college's first president. In 1854, the Atlanta Medical College, a forerunner of Emory University School of Medicine, was founded. On April 12, 1861, the American Civil War began. Emory College was closed in November 1861 and all of its students enlisted on the Confederate side.[29] In late 1863 the war reached Georgia and the college was used as hospital and later a headquarters for the Union Army. The university produced many officers who served in the war, including General George Thomas Anderson (1846C) who fought in nearly every major battle in the eastern theater. Thirty-five Emory students lost their lives and much of the campus was destroyed during the war.[30]

In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by Isaac Stiles Hopkins, a polymath professor at Emory College. Hopkins became the first president of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1888. Emory University's first international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893.[31] Yun became an important political activist in Korea.[32][33]

On August 16, 1906, the Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, was established. In 1914, the Candler School of Theology was established. In 1915, Emory College relocated to Druid Hills and was rechartered as Emory University after accepting a land grant from Asa Griggs Candler, founder of The Coca-Cola Company and brother of commissioned chair Warren Akin Candler[34] Based on large donations from the Candler, Woodruff, and Goizueta families, Emory University is colloquially referred to as "Coca-Cola University".[35] Emory University School of Law was established in 1916.

In 1917, the United States joined the First World War, and Emory University responded by organizing a medical unit composed of faculty and alumni of the medical school. The unit, which became known as Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43, served in Loir-et-Cher, France, from July 1918 to January 1919. During the Second World War, the Emory Unit was mobilized once again and served in the North African campaign and Europe. Emory's contributions to the war effort were recognized by christening a ship, M.S. Emory Victory, which served during World War II and the Korean War.[citation needed]

In the 1940s, Emory University students, alumni, and faculty served in the Asia-Pacific War and European theater of World War II. Lieutenant Commander James L. Starnes, a graduate of Emory Law, was the navigator of the battleship USS Missouri and served as officer of the deck during the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.[36] Bobby Jones, the golfer, served during the Battle of Normandy.[37] Alfred A. Weinstein, a professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, was a prisoner of war of the Empire of Japan between 1942 and 1945. His memoir, Barbed Wire Surgeon, is considered one of the finest accounts concerning allied prisoners under Japanese captivity and highlights the abuses of the war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe.[38] Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed in John Hersey's Hiroshima, was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while studying in the United States.[39] Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Emory helped the nation prepare for war by participating in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and Army Specialized Training Program, programs designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy and United States Army. The Candler School of Theology trained men for military chaplaincy. During the war, university enrollment boasted two military students for every one civilian. Emory University alumni would go on to serve in the Korean War, Second Indochina War (Vietnam War), Persian Gulf War, Yugoslav Wars, and the Global War on Terrorism.[citation needed]

The women's movement and civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially became a coeducational institution in 1953. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially became racially integrated. Marvin S. Arrington Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967.[40]

In 1971, Emory established one of the nation's first African-American studies programs and the first of its kind in the Southeastern United States.[43] Emory's diversity and academic reputation continued to flourish under the leadership of the university's fifth president, James T. Laney. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961–1987). On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.[41] Kim would go on to play a major role in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the eighth President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy. Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009.[40]

In 2005, the university presented the President Medal, a rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. The award is one of the highest honors presented by Emory.[44]

In 2014, at Emory's 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living "Big Six" leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. The law school has committed to raise an additional $500,000 to fund the chair fully.[45]

In November 1979, Emory University experienced a historical shift when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff donated $105 million worth of Coca-Cola stock to the institution. At that time, this was the largest single gift ever made to any institution of higher education in the United States.[29]

The latest additions to the Atlanta Campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts.[40]

Prior to 2018, the campus was in an unincorporated area,[46] statistically counted in the Druid Hills census-designated place.[47] In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta;[48] in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition.[49] The City of Atlanta annexed Emory's campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December.[50]

Gregory L. Fenves, formerly the president of the University of Texas at Austin, became Emory University's 21st president in August 2020.[51]

The Gaza war sparked demonstrations around the U.S., including at Emory. On April 25, 2024, during a pro-Palestinian protest, immediately subsequent to each objecting to the police presence, police detained both philosophy chair Noëlle McAfee[52] and arrested economics professor Caroline Fohlin,[53] who was later charged with battery, following her battering by police.[54] The College of Arts and Science adopted a motion the following day for a college faculty no-confidence vote for Greg Fenves, president of the university,[55] with an electronic vote organized for the following week.[56]

Emory University is considered highly selective. The median SAT score of the class of 2023 was 1500 and median ACT score was 34.

In 2012, Emory University underwent an internal investigation that revealed deliberate falsification of information by members of Emory University's Office of Admission and Institutional Research. These individuals intentionally misreported data concerning entering students' standardized test scores and class rankings between 2000 and 2012 to standard reference sources and third parties who rank colleges and universities.[105] The falsified data aimed to boost the university's rankings.[105] For example, while the office reported an 89% graduation rate within the top 10% of the class, the actual figure stood at only 75%. Following the investigation, the individuals responsible either resigned or were terminated, and the university issued a public apology to address the misconduct.[106] To prevent future inaccuracies in data collection and reporting, Emory University took corrective actions in 2012 and 2013. These measures included the employment of independent data advisers to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the university's data management processes.[107]

Emory University is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".[108] In 2021, Emory received $894.7 million from external funding agencies.[109] Emory University leads the nation in the number of students with Kirschstein-National Research Service Award pre-doctoral fellowships from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).[110]

In 1947, the university donated 15 acres (6 hectares) of land to the United States Department of Health and Human Services for the construction of the CDC headquarters.[111] Emory University Prevention Research Center (EPRC) and Emory Center for Injury Control are funded by the CDC.[23][112] Emory University's African Center of Excellence for Public Health Security, which seeks to improve preparedness and response to health threats in low-income countries, is a five-year, multimillion-dollar cooperative program with the CDC and International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI).[113] Emory University Center for Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, and training to promote global health equity through universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC.[114][115] Emory University Global Health Institute, funded by the Gates Foundation, partners with the CDC to enhance public health infrastructure in low-resource countries.[116] Emory University Hospital Isolation Unit and Quarantine Station was established by the CDC following the 2003 SARS outbreak.[117] The isolation and treatment facilities at Emory University played a crucial role in ending the 2014 ebola virus cases in the United States.[118] CDC scientists and administrators hold memberships and frequently speak at Emory University's Vaccine Dinner Club (VDC), an association that holds monthly academic meetings to discuss and advance vaccine research.[119] In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, a research program in which CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection control and prevention research.[120][121]

Emory University's original campus was established in Oxford, Georgia, in 1836. The 56-acre (23-hectare) campus, located 38 miles (61 kilometers) east of Emory's Atlanta Campus, is home to Oxford College of Emory University and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American Civil War.[30] Many of the buildings were designed with Neoclassical architecture and Gothic Revival architecture. In 1975, the United States National Register of Historic Places designated the campus as part of the Oxford Historic District.[137]

Emory's Atlanta Campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by Pittsburgh architect Henry Hornbostel,[138] covers more than 600 acres (240 hectares) in Atlanta's historic neighborhood of Druid Hills. The university campus is heavily forested with pine, maples, oak, and magnolias, and Peavine Creek, a branch of the Peachtree Creek, runs through the campus. The Arbor Day Foundation named Emory a Tree Campus USA school in 2015.[139] Many of the university's buildings are designed with multi-hued granite and Spanish Saltillo tile. The university has one of the largest inventories by square footage of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified building space among campuses in the United States.[140]

The campus is home to Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia's first and only cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute,[141] the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health-funded national primate research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student facilitates. In 1991, Emory opened the first collegiate LGBT student center in the Southeastern United States which is the tenth oldest in the nation.[142] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston hospital, and Emory Point are located adjacent to the campus.

In 2015, a $52 million expansion and renovation project of the Sanford S. Atwood Chemistry Center was completed. The new, 270,000-square-foot (25,000 m2) complex contains laboratories, interactive teaching and study spaces, and a chemistry library.[143] The completion of the complex was accompanied by a $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to advance and modernize the university's chemistry curriculum.[143]

In the Candler Library Annex of Robert W. Woodruff Library, there is a 1920s Pietro Caproni reproduction of Bertel Thorvaldsen's "The Triumph of Alexander" frieze. The frieze depicts Alexander the Great and his army entering Babylon following their victory over the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Gaugamela.[144]

During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the university hosted the United States Olympic women's gymnastics team on its Atlanta Campus.[145] The team, known as the Magnificent Seven, won the first-ever gold medal for the United States in the women's team all-around competition. The university housed international officials and journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. The Cox Hall Ballroom was transformed into a news center for the Olympic foreign press.[145]

In February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman Jr., to house the university's main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolina–based Duda Paine Architects. Reasons given for the replacement included inconvenience of food delivery to the dining hall, undersized kitchen facilities, and inadequate fenestration in the Commons.[138] The Emory Student Center (ESC), opened in May 2019 includes a dining hall, study and collaboration spaces, game room, a 1,400-plus-person multipurpose space, coffee shop, and food emporium. It is the first building on Emory's campus to receive a LEED platinum rating.[146]

Students may engage in the performing and fine arts as an area of academic study or as extracurricular activities. Undergraduates may pursue a major in the performing arts (dance, theater, or music) or in film studies, art history, visual arts, or creative writing.[153] Graduate programs in art history, film studies, and music are offered.[154] There are more than 50 student organizations dedicated to the arts. Students can explore artistic interests as diverse as architecture, breakdancing, poetry, and improvisational comedy.[155] Emory routinely hosts arts events in the Schwartz Center for Performing Arts that are open to the Emory and Atlanta communities. Recent[when?] performances include Bang on a Can All-Stars (a side project of drummer Glenn Kotche from the rock band Wilco), jazz performer Esperanza Spalding, and New York's Cedar Lake Dance Company. A program called Creativity Conversations brings artistic minds to campus to discuss art and the creative process. Guests have included Philip Glass, Jimmy Carter, Salman Rushdie, Seamus Heaney and Rita Dove.[156][157][158] Rita Dove also gave the keynote address at Emory's 2013 Commencement.[159]

The Barkley Forum Center for Debate Education is an intercollegiate debate organization at Emory University.[160] The center is named in honor of Emory alumnus Alben Barkley, 35th Vice President of the United States. Debating was established at the university in 1837 and the intercollegiate debate team was formed in 1914. Emory's Barkley Forum debate team has won three National Debate Tournaments and over 25 individual champion speaker awards.[161]

The staff is composed entirely of students, with the exception of the general manager, who oversees advertising and whose salary is paid by the newspaper.[165][166]

Fraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's "temple" of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Today, approximately 20% of the Emory student population participates.[167] There are approximately eight sorority chapters[168] and eleven fraternity chapters.[169]

Hundreds of student clubs and organizations operate on Emory's campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. The Student Government Association charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration.[170] Emory also has several secret societies—the Paladin Society, the D.V.S. Senior Honor Society, Ducemus, Speculum, and the Order of Ammon.[171] Coca-Cola pledged three million dollars over a five-year period for "Service for Learning," which coordinates Emory student volunteers in various projects.[172]

Thiel College (/tiːl/, /tiːəl/) is a private college in Greenville, Pennsylvania, United States. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America[3] and is one of the smaller colleges in the region with about 100 full-time and part-time faculty members.

Founded in 1866 as a coeducational institution known as "Thiel Hall", the college started as a result of a meeting between William Passavant and A. Louis Thiel. At the Lutheran Church Pittsburgh Synod convention in Greensburg in 1869, it was decided that Thiel Hall would become a college and serve western Pennsylvania from an initial campus in Philipsburg (now known as Monaca). Four years later, on September 1, 1870, the college received a charter from the government of Pennsylvania and relocated to Greenville, where it was incorporated as Thiel College.[4]

On August 1, 2016, Susan Traverso became the 20th and the first female president of Thiel College.[2]

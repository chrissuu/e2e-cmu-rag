Eastern University (EU) is a private Christian university in the St. Davids, Pennsylvania area, with additional locations in Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. The university offers undergraduate, graduate, and seminary programs. Eastern University is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA and has an interdenominational student body, faculty and administration.

The university has its origins in the foundation of Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1925 in Philadelphia by six Conservative Baptist pastors from the American Baptist Publication Society.[2] In 1932, a collegiate department was founded.[3] The school became a separate institution in 1952 and moved to its present St. Davids location, taking the name Eastern Baptist College.[4] In 1972, it was renamed Eastern College.[5] In 2001, the Pennsylvania Department of Education granted the institution university status and it was renamed Eastern University. In 2004, the institution's board of trustees voted to acquire its previous parent institution and Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary became a subsidiary of Eastern University. The following year, the seminary's name was changed to Palmer Theological Seminary in honor of its longest serving president, Gordon Palmer (1936–48).[6]

In November 2022, the university added sexual orientation to its anti-discrimination policy, allowing the hiring of openly LGBT employees. Following this decision, its membership in the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities was revoked.[7]

The main campus is on 114 acres (46 ha) just west of Philadelphia.[citation needed] It is specifically in Radnor Township.[8] It has a St. Davids postal address,[9] but is outside of (though adjacent to) the St. Davids census-designated place.[10]

It was originally a private estate, named Walmarthon, which was owned by leather tanning businessman Charles S. Walton. The size of the campus has expanded through purchases of surrounding buildings and land. The original buildings on campus were designed by locally renowned architect David Knickerbacker Boyd, in the Mediterranean style.[11][12]

Warner Memorial Library is housed in the Harold Howard Center. The Mazie Hall African American History Room contains books and memorabilia from a local educator. The Edison Room houses several drawings and artifacts which belonged to Thomas Edison.

The Bradstreet Observatory consists of twin 14.5-foot diameter domes that house 16” diameter Meade LX200 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. This addition to Eastern’s facilities created opportunities for astronomical work and research done on campus.

In addition to the main campus in St. Davids, Eastern has additional sites in Pennsylvania: Center City, Philadelphia; City Avenue, Philadelphia; and Harrisburg.[13]

Eastern University offers associate, bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in more than 100 areas of study. The university also offers undergraduate, graduate and noncredit certificates. Academic programs at the institution are housed in seven schools:

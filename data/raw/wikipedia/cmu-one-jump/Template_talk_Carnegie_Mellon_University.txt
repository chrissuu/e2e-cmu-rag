Does it really make sense to have a list of "Carnegie Mellon people" on this list?  Considering the amount of notable people associated with the university, such a list would seemingly be cherrypicked to such a degree as to be useless... Randy Pausch, for instance, is certainly a newsworthy person lately, but in the larger scheme of research and work done at the University, I'm not sure he, Andrew Carnegie, and Herbert Simon make much sense as the three people on this template.

Being bold adding in quite a bit, removed template from people (other than Andrew Carnegie himself). Now passes the Template linking and transclusion check.Naraht (talk) 19:36, 27 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]

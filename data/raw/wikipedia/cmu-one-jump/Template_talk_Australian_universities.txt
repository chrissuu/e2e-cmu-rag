There is also discussion about this proposed template at the Australian Wikipedians' notice board.

Hi, when I created the template my preference was for the full names of the unis, except for the ones with 'technology' in their names, which had to be abbrieviated for length. Every uni has an acronym, e.g. UNE, JCU, ACU, UWS. However we should keep the full names for as many of the unis as we can. Many people will use this template and not be aware of the correct abbreviation. - Randwicked Alex B 04:30, 30 January 2006 (UTC)[reply]

I've tried out a new system of abbreviation, Blah U/U of Blah. Comments? - Randwicked Alex B 15:46, 17 April 2006 (UTC)[reply]

Is there a reason this is left off? It is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, and although it is proposed that it amalgamate with UTas in 2008, it isn't 2008 yet... Natebailey 11:57, 15 July 2007 (UTC)[reply]

I removed Cranfield University as I could not find any evidence that it operates as a university in Australia.  It is not a member of Universities Australia; it is not accredited as a higher education provider under the AQF; and the Cranfield in Australia Web page only mentions short courses - no university degrees. miracleworker5263 (talk) 09:50, 22 November 2010 (UTC)[reply]

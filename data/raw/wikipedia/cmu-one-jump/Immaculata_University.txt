Immaculata University is a private Catholic university in East Whiteland Township, Pennsylvania, United States.[3][4] It was founded by the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

The university has 1,427 traditional undergraduate and adult undergraduate students, and more than 1,000 graduate and doctoral students. The university is located on more than 300 acres (120 ha).[5]

Immaculata was founded as Villa Maria College, a women's college, in 1920. It was the first Catholic college for women in the Philadelphia area. The name was changed to Immaculata College in 1929.[6]

Founded by the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Immaculata is part of the greater IHM community, which includes the neighboring House of Studies and an academy for girls (now split into two campuses, Lower School and High School). The university became co-educational in the fall of 2005.

The current location of Immaculata University is in the Great Valley region of Chester County, Pennsylvania, near the Philadelphia Main Line community of Malvern, purchased by the sisters in 1906. The original 198-acre (0.80 km2) plot has grown to 373 acres (1.51 km2) since that time.

In June 2002, Immaculata College received confirmation of university status from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Effective August 2002, the college is now known as Immaculata University.

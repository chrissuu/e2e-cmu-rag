The University of Southern Queensland is a public research university based in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, the sixth largest city in the Australian state of Queensland[9] Founded in 1967 after a successful campaign by the local Darling Downs community, the university is a founding member of the Regional Universities Network.

The main Toowoomba campus occupies a large area of south-western Toowoomba in the suburb of Darling Heights. Campuses in Ipswich and Springfield also exist, with the university-owned Queensland College of Wine Tourism being home to a study hub in Stanthorpe[10] The university also owns and operates the Mount Kent Observatory, which is the only professional astronomical research observatory in Queensland. The Ravensbourne Field Studies Centre and a Brisbane City industry hub are also operated by the university.[11] The university has also partnered with the Canterbury Institute of Technology to offer the Sydney Education Centre. 

Through twelve schools, the university offers a variety of associate, bachelor, master, doctoral, and higher doctorate degrees[12] The university operates three research institutes and nine research centres which focus on a wide range of business, agricultural, scientific, environmental, and technological issues.[13] Recent notable research includes the discovery of Gliese 12 b, an Earth-like planet 40 light years away making it the closest located to date.[14]

The University of Southern Queensland consistently ranks among the top 400 universities worldwide. In the 2026 US News Best Global Universities rankings, it is positioned at 278th.[15] In the 2025 QS World University Rankings, the University of Southern Queensland holds the 396th spot.[16] In the 2023 Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings, it is placed within the 301-350 range.[17]

After a meeting of over 200 members of the Toowoomba community on 2 December 1960, the Darling Downs University Establishment Association (DDUEA) was founded with the purpose of establishing a university in the Darling Downs region. Chaired by former mayor of Toowoomba Dr. Alex McGregor, the association successfully lobbied the local, state, and federal government for the establishment of an Institute of Technology located in Toowoomba. After the establishment of the Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs), the association became known as the Darling Downs Association for Advanced Education (DDAAE), and later Darling Downs Unilink Limited.[18] Darling Downs Unilink Limited went into receivership in 1996, with a subsequent auction of the organisation's art collection.[19]

The Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs) (QITDD) opened on 2 February 1967 in Toowoomba, beginning with 140 foundation students.[20] By 1970, the institution provided studying programs for rural Queensland and international communities.[9][21]

In 1971, the institute became the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education (DDIAE). Managed by its own College Council, DDIAE educated 75% of the country's international students in the 1986â€“1987 school year.[20]

On the evening of 11 April 1979, a fire destroyed the Administration Building (B Block). This resulted in the loss of the mailroom and switchboard. The cause of the fire was a staff member activating a bank of light switches which, unbeknownst to them, were also connected to a wall strip heater obscured by computer printout paper. While the damage was significant, student academic records were not affected and the institute was able to continue operating.[22]

From 1980 to 1990, DDIAE grew significantly from 1,000 to 8,000 full-time student equivalents (EFTSL).[20]

It became the University College of Southern Queensland (UCSQ) in 1990,[20] under the sponsorship of the University of Queensland.[23]

In 1992, the institution became the University of Southern Queensland when it gained full university status.[20] The university was a founding member of the Regional Universities Network that was launched in 2011.[24] The Network's research in 2013 showed that the university generated $411.7 million into the economy of Queensland every year as well as household income of $255.4 million and 3,313 jobs in the communities of Toowoomba, Fraser Coast, and Springfield.[25]

In 2012, the university's archaeologists discovered the oldest Australian rock art of 28,000 years old in the Northern Territory,[26] and in 2018, the university's astronomers discovered a new planet that orbits an ancient star almost 2 billion years older than the sun.[27][28] It has been recognised for its efforts in preventing violence against women[29] and was cited as employer of choice for gender equality by the Federal Government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA).[30]

In June 2022, the university announced it was changing its branding from USQ to UniSQ, accompanied by a change in logo.[31]

The fourteen-member council is the governing body of the University of Southern Queensland.[34]

The council is made up of the following people:[35]

The university has twelve schools that support teaching and research:[36]

The University of Southern Queensland uses multiple academic calendars depending on the academic course studied, with the most common being a Trimester academic calendar.[37]

Students, staff, and faculty members of the university engage in a variety of extracurricular activities, such as taking part in the One Million Stars to End Violence project,[38] organising symposiums to change people's attitude about children with autism,[39] improving literacy for Indigenous children,[40] and providing healthcare to disadvantaged communities in Thailand.[41] In 2017, the Association for Tertiary Education Management (ATEM) presented Stars Campaign to End Violence with the Engagement Australia Award for Excellence in Community Engagement.[38] In 2015, the Enactus National Conference and Competition recognised three projects (Cash to Grow, Tertiary Texts, and Project Ignite) by eight University of Southern Queensland students (majoring in business, accounting, law, human services, psychology, and education) for creating positive impacts in local communities.[42] The members of the university's Golden Key Chapter (an invitation-only honour society, including of top 15% students from universities worldwide based on their academic achievement) also engage in a wide range of activities to serve the community, including volunteering with local schools, youth clubs, and state emergency service.[43]

The Law Society at the university organises a yearly MOOT competition for law students and a Secondary Schools MOOT competition for young high schoolers.[44][45][46][47][48] The winners of the university's MOOT competition represent the region to take part in the Association National Championship Moot organised in Brisbane for Australian law students.[48] The winners of the university's Secondary Schools MOOT competition received scholarships to study in law programs at the university.[45] The university'sLaw Society also organises events for law students to get career advice from professionals and learn to overcome challenges in the profession.[49]

In the 2015 Northern Uni Games, student-athletes won a gold medal in women's tennis, both gold and silver medals in lawn bowls, and bronze medals in both men's and women's basketball.[50] In 2016 Northern Uni Games, student-athletes won two gold medals in women's hockey and women's tennis, and a silver medal in open lawn bowls.[51] In 2017 Northern Uni Games, student-athletes won three gold medals in men's tennis, woman's tennis, and golf handicap, one silver medal in men's basketball, and another bronze medal in men's tennis.[52] Students also competed in other sport tournaments at national and international levels, such as represented the Queensland Blades in the 2017 Australian Hockey League Championships,[53] won the first places in ANB Qld State Championships[54], received the national Green and Gold merit after the annual 2016 Australian University Games,[55] and captained Australia in the 2018 Indoor Hockey World Cup in Germany.[56]

The university also supports year 11 and 12 students with skills to improve the quality of life in local communities through Change Makers program. The program provides young students with financial support, guidance, and other resources to develop their visions of a better future and bring these ideas into practice. The program is an opportunity for students, especially disadvantaged students, to engage in teamwork, develop the skills of public speaking and project management. According to the National Center for Student Equity in Higher Education, twenty projects have been completed by students through Change Makers programs, including building a garden in community school to feed homeless people, raising awareness of inequality through concerts, and managing other projects dealing with pollution in community environments. The program won the CASE Circle of Excellence Silver Award for Public Relations and Community Relations Projects in 2015.[57][58]

Students at the University of Southern Queensland produce plays, films, and entertainment shows addressing culture, gender identity, and the struggles of young people, including Ghosts of Leigh by Dallas Baker,[59] Velvet Bourlevard by Ian Fulton,[60] and I dated Batman by Tammy Sarah.[61] The university also established the Bruce Dawe Poetry Prize (named after the university's first honorary professor for his contribution to the university) in 1999 to honour the most prominent poets in Australia.[62] In addition, Artsworx, established as an art venue and production house, supports students, artists, and community art activities through its McGregor Summer School,[63] McGregor bursary,[64] exhibition sponsorships at Downland Art exhibition,[64] Hampton Art exhibition,[65] GraduArt exhibition (annual art exhibition by students at the university),[66] and art exhibition raising funds for breast cancer treatment at St. Vincent Hospital.[67]

The flexible work arrangements and the program of Women's Advancement reflect the university's commitment to gender equality and the role of women in the workplace.[citation needed] Funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Australian Centre for Sustainable Business and Development at the University of Southern Queensland has conducted different international programs of approximately $1 million, such as Australian Awards Fellowship and AusAid Australian Leadership Awards Fellowship, aiming at fostering the role of women in business in accordance with Australian policies and practices.[68]

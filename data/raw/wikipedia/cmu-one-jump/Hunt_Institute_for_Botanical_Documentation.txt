The Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation (HIBD), dedicated as the Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt Botanical Library in 1961, is a research division of Carnegie Mellon University.

HIBD is named for Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt.[1][2][3] She donated a collection of botanical books to the university to create HIBD. An annual monetary award is given in her honor by the institute.[4]

HIBD was dedicated October 10, 1961.[5] George H. M. Lawrence was the founding director.[6] In 1970, Gilbert Daniels, became the second director.[7]  T. D. Jacobsen succeeded Robert Kiger as director in 2019.[8]

HIBD is an institution of international bibliographical research in the fields of botany, horticulture, and plant science history. It has a research library with over 30,000 works and art holdings.  It includes art and  bibliography departments.[citation needed]

HIBD is better known internationally than in the U.S.[9] It has a collection of botanical paintings (many of them watercolors), drawings, and  prints dating from the Renaissance to contemporary works. Its library has books from an equally expansive time frame.[citation needed]

HIBD hosts public exhibitions, including the triennial International Exhibition of Botanical Art & Illustration since 1964. That exhibition coincides with the educational conference of the American Society of Botanical Artists in Pittsburgh.[9]

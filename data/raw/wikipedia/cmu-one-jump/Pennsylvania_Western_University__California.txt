Pennsylvania Western University, California (abbreviated as PennWest California) is a campus of Pennsylvania Western University in California, Pennsylvania, United States.[2] The campus had an enrollment of 2,717 as of fall 2024.[1]

Founded in 1852 and merged into Pennsylvania Western University in 2021, the university offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.[3] It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.[2] The school was California University of Pennsylvania from 1983 to 2022, before the merger.

California University of Pennsylvania traces its roots back to 1852, when the community of California spent tax money and donations to create an academy for kindergarten through college-level courses. Its first principal was Ellis N. Johnson Jr. of Ohio.[4][5] In 1864, it purchased 10 acres (4.0 ha) and moved to what is now the center of its present location, and a year later the school received a charter to be a normal school. In 1874, the institution was renamed Southwestern Normal School and in 1914 Pennsylvania bought the school, renaming it the California State Normal School and converted it into a two-year institute for training of elementary school teachers.[4]

In 1928 the school restored a full four-year curriculum and was renamed the California State Teachers College. The programs offered were expanded over time and broadened beyond teacher training, and by 1959 the school's name was condensed to California State College. In 1962, the school added a graduate program. The school became a part of the State System of Higher Education on July 1, 1983. At the same time, it was granted university status under the name, California University of Pennsylvania.

In July 2021, the university was officially merged with fellow Western Pennsylvania institutions Clarion University of Pennsylvania and Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. On October 14, 2021, the state officially adopted the new and current name of the combined universities: Pennsylvania Western University.

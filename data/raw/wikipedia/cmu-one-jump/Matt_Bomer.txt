Timothy McNeil's drama Anything marked Bomer's final film release of 2017 and McNeil making his feature directorial debut.[86] Bomer was cast as Freda Von Rhenburg, a transgender sex worker who lives in Los Angeles and begins a relationship with her neighbor, Early Landry (played by John Carroll Lynch).[86] Anything is based on McNeil's play of the same name.[86] He has received some criticism from the transgender community for the casting of a cisgender man, to play a transgender woman.[87][88] Jon Frosch of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Bomer: "gives a performance of real warmth and delicacy," saying that: "rather than play Freda as a force of nature or a collection of mannerisms—the typical default modes of actors playing trans women—Bomer renders her fully dimensional: an unpredictable tangle of impulses, by turns defensive and tender."[89] Anything had its release at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 17, 2017.[90] Also in 2017, Bomer was a guest narrator at Disney's Candlelight Processional.[91]

There is a security, a validity. It's just a feeling, I think—something about saying vows in front of the people around you who love and support you. I think it was good for our family."[124][125] The couple has three children through surrogacy, one born in 2005 and twins born in 2008.[126][118]

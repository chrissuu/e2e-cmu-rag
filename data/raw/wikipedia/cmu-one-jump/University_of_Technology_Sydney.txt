The University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is a public research university located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The university was founded in its current form in 1988, though its origins as a technical institution can be traced back to the 1870s. UTS is a founding member of the Australian Technology Network (ATN), and is a member of Universities Australia (UA) and the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN).

The university is organised into 9 faculties and schools, which together administers 130 undergraduate courses and 210 postgraduate courses. In 2024, the university enrolled 51,038 students, including 35,453 undergraduate students.[8] The university is home to over 45 research centres and institutes, who regularly collaborates along with industry and government partners.[8]

UTS recognises more than 180 different clubs and societies. Its varsity sports teams, which is overseen by UTS Sport, competes in the UniSport Nationals as well as in standalone national championships throughout the year.[12] As of 2024, the university has over 280,000 alumni worldwide.[5]

The Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts (the oldest continuously running Mechanics' Institute in Australia) was established in 1833.[13] In the 1870s, the school expanded into technical education and formed the Working Men's College, which was later taken over by the NSW government to form the Sydney Technical College.[14]

In 1940 the NSW Parliament passed an Act to establish an Institute of Technology, which in 1964 led to the establishment of the New South Wales Institute of Technology (NSWIT). In 1968, the NSW Institute of Technology amalgamated with the NSW Institute of Business Studies. In 1976 NSWIT established the first law school in NSW outside the university sector. The Haymarket campus officially opened in 1985.

On 8 October 1987 university status was granted to NSWIT, which was followed by the passing of the University of Technology, Sydney, Act 1987. It was reconstituted as the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) on 26 January 1988, along with the incorporation of the School of Design of the former Sydney College of the Arts.[3] In 1989, the University of Technology, Sydney, Act 1989 (NSW) formed UTS by absorbing the Kuring-gai College of Advanced Education (KCAE) and the Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education (ITATE) of the Sydney College of Advanced Education. By 1991, an academic structure of nine faculties and 25 schools was established.[3]

The School of Design was initially housed at a campus in Balmain, which closed at the end of 1994, with the school moved to a new building at the city campus.[15][16] The environmental, biological and biomedical science schools were located on a campus at St Leonards, which was closed in 2006, which also relocated to the city campus following a redevelopment.[17][18]

The Kuring-Gai campus closed at the end of 2015, with classes and facilities moved into the main Haymarket campus. This marked the consolidation of UTS into a single unified campus in the Sydney CBD.[19]

The UTS city campus is located at the southern border of Sydney's central business district, close to Central station and Railway Square, within Sydney's emerging Tech Central.[20] The UTS Tower is the nucleus of the city campus, fronting on to Broadway.[21]

The campus consists of five distinct precincts. Broadway, Haymarket and Blackfriars are located at the city campus, while precincts at Moore Park and Botany integrate specialist facilities with surrounding industry organisations.[21] Broadway (located in Ultimo) is home to the faculties of Science, Health, Law, Arts and Social Sciences, Engineering and IT, and Design, Architecture and Building, as well as the UTS Library. Haymarket is the location of the Business School, UTS Startups, the UTS Animal Logic Academy and two lecture theatres in the Powerhouse Museum. The Blackfriars precinct in Chippendale contains the Blackfriars Children's Centre and research and innovation teams while the Moore Park precinct features sports facilities within the Rugby Australia Building and the Botany precinct consists of the specialist research facility UTS Tech Lab.[21][22][23]

The campus has been substantially transformed since 2008 by the university's City Campus Master Plan, a $1 billion-plus investment in new buildings and facilities, major upgrades and refurbishments.[24][25]

The UTS Tower on Broadway (Building 1) is an example of brutalist architecture with square and block concrete designs. Completed and officially opened in 1979 by Premier Neville Wran,[26] the Tower initially housed the NSW Institute of Technology, which transformed to become UTS in the late 1980s.[27] In October 2006, the UTS Tower was voted the ugliest building in Sydney in a poll hosted by The Sydney Morning Herald, receiving 23% of the total vote.[28] The Tower is the largest campus building in terms of both height and floor space.[29]

Other notable buildings in the Broadway precinct include:

The Haymarket precinct includes buildings such as:

Additionally in the Moore Park precinct, the Rugby Australia Building contains specialist facilities for UTS students, staff and researchers working across sport and exercise science, physiotherapy and sport media. Designed by architects Populous, the building is also the headquarters of Rugby Australia and home to Australia's national rugby teams.[23] The external fixed aluminium shading controls solar penetration, while internal spaces include the purpose-built laboratories of the Human Performance Research Centre.[48]

A number of UTS campus buildings have received a certified Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of Australia. The Vicki Sara Building has been awarded a 6 Star Green Star Design and As-Built Rating,[49][37] while the Faculty of Engineering and IT and Dr Chau Chak Wing Buildings has been awarded 5 stars.[50][51]

UTS provides library services through the UTS Library and Reading Room in Building 2 (UTS Central), as well as a range of online services on the UTS Library website.[30][52]

The UTS Gallery and Art Collection contains over 850 works, with a focus on contemporary Australian and Indigenous art.[53] The artworks from the collection are on display throughout the UTS campus, including in every building.[53] The university has been expanding its collection of digital and new media works. UTS Central is home to a 12-metre wide digital screen, which showcases large-scale digital artworks by leading Australian artists.[54]

The core of the UTS city campus is located close to many Sydney landmarks and notable organisations including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Powerhouse Museum, TAFE Ultimo, the International Convention Centre Sydney, Darling Harbour and Chinatown.[21][55]

Entities within the Central Park development, opposite the UTS Tower on Broadway, partner with the University on sustainability initiatives, which include a recycled water partnership and a district energy-sharing project commended at the 2018 Smart City Awards.[56][57]

The UTS Academic Board is the principal advisory body to the UTS Council on academic matters.

The Academic Board is concerned with policy development as it relates to the University's academic programs in education, scholarship and research, and community service. It refers to policy recommendations to Council and discusses matters referred to it by Council.

Academic Board plays a key role in the UTS community in providing a forum for the discussion and debate of the academic directions of the University as well as the quality of its academic programs. The Board consists of academic staff members as well as student members elected for a general period of 1â€“2 years.[61]

Diane Jolly harassment scandal (2021)

In 2021, the former Dean of Science Diane Jolley was found guilty of causing financial disadvantage by deception after orchestrating a campaign of intimidation â€“ against herself â€“ while pushing to cut the UTS traditional Chinese medicine degree.[117] Cutting of the traditional Chinese medicine degree was hotly disputed and a petition of 9000 students and alumni fought to keep the course running affecting more than 20 staff and 250 students at the time.[118] Jolley was sentenced to 2 years 6 months, to be served by way of Intensive Corrections Order for dishonestly causing financial disadvantage by deception by conveying information likely to make a person fear for the safety of a person, knowing that the information was false or misleading.[119]

Management, staff distress, and SafeWork intervention (2025)

In 2025, UTS launched a cost-cutting plan, dubbed the Operational Sustainability Initiative, aiming to reduce approximately 400 staff roles and save A$100 million, which included suspending nearly 150 course intakes for the 2026 academic year.[120] Staff reported elevated levels of psychological distress amid a perceived lack of consultation and transparency. The National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) denounced the leadership's handling as symptomatic of serious governance failures, citing budget blow-outs, flawed decision-making and low morale; particularly when the university published 50 tips for staff wellbeing, including washing delicates or flossing teeth.[121] In response to mounting concerns, SafeWork NSW issued a prohibition notice, pausing all redundancy-related meetings and the formal change proposal due to a "serious and imminent risk of psychological harm" to staff.[122] This is an unprecedented step in the history of SafeWork NSW.[123]

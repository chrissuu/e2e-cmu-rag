Gannon University is a private Catholic university with campuses in Erie, Pennsylvania, and Ruskin, Florida, United States. Established in 1925, Gannon University enrolls about 4,600 undergraduate and graduate students annually. Its intercollegiate athletics include 18 athletic programs for men and women competing at the NCAA Division II level. It plans to merge with Ursuline College by the end of 2026.

Gannon University was established in 1933 as the two-year Cathedral College by the Diocese of Erie under the leadership of Joseph J. "Doc" Wehrle.[2] In 1944, the school became the four-year men's school Gannon College of Arts and Sciences, named for then-Bishop of Erie, John Mark Gannon, the driving force behind its opening and development. The college became coeducational in 1964 and gained university status in 1979.[3][4]

The all-girls school Villa Maria College, which was founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1925,[5] merged with the university in 1989.[6] Its Villa Maria School of Nursing retains the name of the original institution.

In 2024, the university's board of trustees approved plans to merge the university with Ursuline College. Ursuline will become a part of Gannon as "Ursuline College Campus of Gannon University" with its own academic and athletic programs.[7]

The university is organized into three main colleges: the College of Engineering and Business, which includes the Dahlkemper School of Business Administration; the College of Humanities, Education and Social Sciences; and the Morosky College of Health Professions and Sciences.

U.S. News & World Report ranked Gannon University No. 260 in National Universities in 2024 and No. 244 in 2025.[8][9]

Gannon University's campus is in downtown Erie, primarily between Peach and Myrtle Streets and 3rd and 10th Streets. In summer 2015, a doctoral branch campus opened in Ruskin, Florida, focusing on healthcare majors.[10]

Gannon is a member of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference in NCAA Division II. Gannon offers 19 Division II scholarship-granting varsity sports, that includes nine men's and women's teams. The men participate in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, water polo, wrestling, competitive cheer. The women participate in basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, acrobatics and tumbling, and competitive cheer and dance.

In June 2007, Gannon University, along with cross-town rival Mercyhurst College, was accepted into the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference, where area schools Pennsylvania Western University, Edinboro and Slippery Rock University are members. Along with Gannon and Mercyhurst as full members, LIU Post also was accepted into the conference as an affiliate member.[11]

The school's football program began with the 1949 team that compiled a perfect 8–0 and shut out six of eight opponents. The 1950 team also compiled a winning record of 6–2. However, the teams did not draw well at the box office, and the Gannon board of control voted in April 1951 to discontinue the football program.[12] After the 1950 season, Gannon did not field a college football team for the next 38 years. The school resumed college football competition in 1989.[13] Since 1989, Gannon has competed at the NCAA Division II level.

Penn State New Kensington is a commonwealth campus of the Pennsylvania State University located in New Kensington, Pennsylvania. The campus has an enrollment of 545 undergraduate students and offers twelve bachelor's degree programs and five associate degree programs as well as four men's and four women's sports. In May 2025, the Board of Trustees of Pennsylvania State University announced the closure of seven of its twenty regional Commonwealth campuses after the Spring 2027 semester, including Penn State New Kensington.[1]

The New Kensington campus was founded in 1958 as a result of a study of the local need for higher education in the Alle-Kiski Valley. The first class graduated in 1960 at the New Kensington Center in the city of New Kensington. The Center moved to the old Parnassus School in 1963. The current campus opened with the Engineering Building in 1966 on 35 acres (140,000 m2) donated by ALCOA. Two years later the Science, Activities, and Administration buildings and the Library were completed and an additional 30 acres (120,000 m2) were purchased from a neighboring farmer. In 1969 the Physical Education Complex opened followed by the Theatre in 1971 and the Student Learning Center in 1975. The Science and Technology Center opened in 1990. After a ten-year building hiatus, the Conference Center and Classroom Building was dedicated in March 2001.

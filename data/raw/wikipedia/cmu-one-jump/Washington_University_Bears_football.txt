The Washington University Bears football team represents Washington University in St. Louis in college football. The team competes at the NCAA Division III level as an affiliate member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin (CCIW). They are a primary member of the University Athletic Association, of which they were a founding member. They were previously a founding member of the Missouri Valley Conference whose bigger schools split into the Big Eight Conference and then added a few members to form the Big 12 Conference.[3]

On September 4, 2024, the Division III web outlet D3sports.com reported that the CCIW would expel Washington from football membership after the 2025 season, with the report soon confirmed by the conference office.[4] On October 18, 2024, the North Coast Athletic Conference announced that Washington would join as a football-only member, beginning in the 2026 season.[5]

The school's first football team was fielded in 1887. The team plays its home games at the 3,300 seat Francis Olympic Field.

Former Washington University Bears football player and head coach Jimmy Conzelman is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[6] Another former head coach, Weeb Ewbank, later coach of AFL, NFL, and Super Bowl champion teams is also in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[7]

Two former Washington University head coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Bob Higgins in 1954[8] and Carl Snavely in 1965.[9]

Two former Washington University players have also been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Harvey Jablonsky in 1978[10] and Shelby Jordan in 2013.[11] Both Jablonsky and Jordan were All-Americans. Jordan went on to win Super Bowl XVIII with the Los Angeles Raiders.

Former Bears linebacker Brandon Roberts won the Vincent dePaul Draddy Trophy from the National Football Foundation as the nation's top football student-athlete in 2002. Roberts is the only non-FBS recipient of the award.[12]

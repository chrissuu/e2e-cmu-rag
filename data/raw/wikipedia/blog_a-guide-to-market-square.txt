You'll definitely want to experience Market Square during the holidays as it turns into an incredibly festive Winter Wonderland! The Peoples Gas Holiday Marketâ„¢ , inspired by the original German Christkindlmarkts (or "Christmas Market"), brings a cherished European tradition to Pittsburgh.
With an international flair and local charm, the market features shops from around the world with Asian, African, Haitian and Latin American goods. You can also find Santa's House and plenty of helper elves around an illuminated market square for a unique family-friendly photo op.
Across the way from the square is The Rink at PPG Place , an outdoor ice skating rink complete with a stunning 65-foot illuminated Holiday tree in the center.
The 2025 Peoples Gas Holiday Market opened Nov. 22 and runs through Dec. 24, giving you plenty of time to shop! The weekend before Thanksgiving hosts Highmark Light Up Night , which dazzles by lighting the Christmas Tree downtown along with musical acts, firework displays, shopping, food and so much more.
VENUE CHANGE: With construction in Market Square, the 2025 Peoples Gas Holiday Market has been moved to the Cultural District.

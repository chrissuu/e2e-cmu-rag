Application and First-Year Experience
Students applying to the College of Engineering apply to and are admitted directly to a department/major unless choosing undecided. Only students admitted as undecided within the College of Engineering are allowed to choose among the primary majors of Civil, Chemical, Electrical & Computer, Environmental, Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering during the spring semester of their first year. Requests to change majors will be considered after the first year, but are not guaranteed to be approved and will be evaluated on a case by case basis.
Students who are accepted to Civil & Environmental Engineering will declare either Civil Engineering or Environmental Engineering at the end of the fall semester of their first year.
In the spring of their first year, all students will also have the opportunity to declare an additional major from among Biomedical Engineering; Engineering and Public Policy; Engineering, Design, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship; and Engineering and Fine Arts.

Philanthropy changes lives.
Each year on Valentineâ€™s Day, we shower Carnegie Mellon donors with love on behalf of every member of the Tartan community who can pursue their passions and do work that matters with the resources they need to be successful.
Thank a Donor Day 2025 celebrates those who make everything at CMU possible through their gifts to scholarships and fellowships, faculty and research support, athletics, facilities, experiential learning opportunities and so much more!

Synopsis - contains spoilers!
Summer 1943. Mary Cardwell Dawson’s rehearsal studio. The National Negro Opera Company is preparing to present two operas at the outdoor Watergate Concert Barge in Washington, D.C. For the company’s ambitious schedule, La traviata was performed on the first night with the great soprano Madame Lillian Evanti. However, the damp weather was unsuitable, and the attendance was disappointing.
Madame Mary Cardwell Dawson meets with the singers who will perform the leads in a planned performance of Carmen: Frank (Don José), Isabelle (Micaëla), and Phoebe (Carmen). Fearing the rain will again keep the audience away, Madame Dawson inquires about renting a concert hall. While the hall manager agrees to rent to the NNOC, he informs Madame Dawson that the venue has a policy of segregated seating.
The future of the company hangs in the balance: according to the Union agreement, the artists and other personnel must be paid, whether the concert takes place or not. An outdoor performance in the rain is sure to be a disappointment, but an indoor performance with segregated seating is unacceptable.
The young singers, eager to make their mark, urge Madame Dawson to consider the hall. She initially will not hear it, but as rehearsals continue and the weather worsens, she has moments of doubt. The Union board, expecting a breach of contract, demands she leave rehearsal for an emergency meeting. When they insult her, she fights back and is taken to jail. After Madame Dawson is bailed out, Madame Dawson returns to rehearsal, bruised but undaunted.
The young singers realize that Madame Dawson’s life—her determination and struggle—is the greatest lesson she has for them. They tell her they will sing in the rain if necessary. Just as they resolve to go forward, the rain stops.

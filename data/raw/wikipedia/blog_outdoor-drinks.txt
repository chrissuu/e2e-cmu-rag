A Vietnamese eatery, Ineffable Cà Phê , is a great neighborhood spot for trying something new. Grab one of their lattes from their full espresso bar, one of their traditional cà phê sữa, or a made-to-order bubble tea and relax outside.
'One thing that is great about Ineffable is they make ordering bubble tea so easy for newcomers with their step-by-step menu. If you need help, the staff is so friendly!
As far as their outdoor space at Ineffable, you will find there is plenty of it. Tables can be found in the fenced-off front lot and alongside the building. In the front, there are several tables underneath their tent strung with twinkle lights as well as some cozier seating on the patio directly attached to the building.

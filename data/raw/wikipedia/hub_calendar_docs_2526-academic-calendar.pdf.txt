Calendar Notes
information about Course Changes: Add, Drop, Withdrawal & Voucher Election
Students taking courses in the Heinz College, Tepper School of Business MBA, or in the Computational Finance programs must review
and follow those separate academic calendars for those courses.
-- Similarly, students taking courses defined as doctoral sections must review and follow that separate academic calendar for those
* courses.
Students dropping a course while remaining enrolled (in at least one course-section) will receive a tuition adjustment only if they drop
by this date.
1 -- Students taking a Leave of Absence or Withdrawing from the University should consult the official Tuition Adjustment Policy
Not applicable for graduate students in CFA, DC & SCS. Only graduate students in CIT, HC, MCS & TSB students receive W grades
2 for course withdrawal.
Course withdrawal is not an option after this date for students taking undergraduate or masters course-sections. Students must decide
if they wish to use their course drop voucher, and should discuss their options with their academic advisor in advance of these dates.
-- Students taking course-sections designated as doctoral courses are exempt from this restriction ONLY IN THOSE designated
course-sections.
3
Advisor approval is required for vouchers to be initiated. It is strongly recommended that you contact your advisor prior to the
posted deadline to discuss options.
-- Please contact your advisor before 12 noon on the deadline date.
4 -- Doctoral students do not receive vouchers.
Regarding Grade Due dates, please note that fall & spring mid-semester as well as mini-1 & 3 grades are due the Monday after break
instead of during break in both fall and spring. This confirms to a desire for a single due date, and with mini finals on Saturday, it
** provides additional time for grading.
Summer Session all corresponds to Summer Semester dates.
Summer Session One and Summer Session Two correspond to Summer One & Mini-5and Summer Two & Mini-6 dates & deadlines,
*** respectively.
**** Summer Session All, One and Two Final Exams will be scheduled by the Registrar's Office.

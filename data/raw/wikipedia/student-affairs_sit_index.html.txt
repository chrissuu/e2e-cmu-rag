Student Involvement & Traditions
At Carnegie Mellon University, work that matters doesn't happen exclusively in the classroom. CMU's Office of Student Involvement and Traditions is the place where meta-curricular, student-led initiatives come to life and shape our community.
From planning memory-making moments to supporting ideas and creativity, we show up for students to help them achieve their goals and initiatives beyond the classroom.
Let's work together
We aim to be accessible. We love questions, and we're here to help you navigate campus — through student organizations, CMU's signature traditions and events, and whatever you can dream up next.

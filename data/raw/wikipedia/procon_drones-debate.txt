Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), otherwise known as drones, are remotely controlled aircraft that may be armed with missiles and bombs for attack missions. Since the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 , and the subsequent “ War on Terror ,” the United States has used thousands of armed drones to kill suspected terrorists and militants in Pakistan , Afghanistan , Yemen , Somalia , and other countries.
Earliest Drones
The first recorded unmanned air strike occurred on July 15, 1849, when the Habsburg Austrian Empire launched 200 pilotless balloons armed with bombs against the revolution-minded citizens of Venice. During the U.S. Civil War , both the Union and the Confederate sides sent balloons loaded with explosives and time-sensitive triggers over their opponents, though the strategy was ineffective. [1] [89]
The modern electronically controlled military drone traces its origins to the 1930s, when the British Royal Navy developed the Queen Bee, a radio-controlled drone used for aerial target practice by British pilots. Between Nov. 1944 and Apr. 1945, Japan released more than 9,000 bomb-laden balloons across the Pacific, intending to cause forest fires and panic in the Western United States in operation “Fu-Go.” Most of the balloons caused minimal damage or fell in the Pacific Ocean , but more than 300 made their way into the U.S. and Canada . Because the U.S. government, in concert with the American press, kept the balloons a secret, the Japanese believed the tactic to be ineffective and abandoned the project. [87] [88] [89]
What Is a Drone?
Companies have developed dozens of drone models, ranging in size from large solar-powered fixed-wing aircraft to small hummingbird -mimicking helicopter -like drones, all with a wide variety of capabilities and ranging in cost from $600 to at least $103.7 million per drone. The starting price for a weaponized drone in 2013 was about $15 million. [91] [123]
The two most widely used weaponized drones have been the MQ-1 Predator (which the U.S. military officially retired on Mar. 9, 2018) and the upgraded MQ-9 Reaper, both developed by military contractor General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. The Predator drones were first flown in June 1994 and deployed by NATO in 1995 in the Balkans during the Bosnian War (1992–95), while the Reaper was first deployed in Oct. 2007 in Afghanistan. [90] [91] [92] [124] [125]
The Reaper, flown remotely by pilots, can cruise for 27 hours, get close-up views from 10,000 feet (3,050 meters), and carry Hellfire missiles as well as both laser- and GPS -guided bombs. [128]
Cost of Drones
According to an analysis by the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College , the U.S. Department of Defense’s fiscal year 2018 budget request included $6.97 billion for drone research, development, and procurement as well as system-specific construction—a five-year high and 21% more than the enacted fiscal year 2017 drone budget. The largest drone line item in the fiscal year 2018 proposed budget was the MQ-9 Reaper, at $1.23 billion. [126]
The fiscal year 2019 Department of Defense drone budget request increased to $9.39 billion, including adding 3,447 new drones, according to the Center for the Study of the Drone, which ceased research in spring 2020. [127]
A single Reaper drone cost about $14 million in 2008. That figure rose to $32 million by June 10, 2020, making the Reaper more expensive than a top-end AH-64E Apache helicopter. [128]
While budgets and costs have undoubtedly increased, numbers are difficult to impossible to come by, as fewer and fewer organizations track military drones and drone spending.
George W. Bush Administration and the “War on Terror”
On Sept. 7, 2000, the CIA sent the first unarmed drone to fly over Afghanistan. In late Sept. an unarmed drone spotted Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, who was then wanted for his role in financing and organizing terrorist attacks against American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998. The drone reportedly observed bin Laden for four hours and 23 minutes at Tarnak Farms, an al-Qaeda camp. Because there was no guarantee that cruise missiles could strike bin Laden, the CIA lobbied to have Hellfire missiles, which are lightweight anti-tank missiles, attached to a Predator drone. [129] [130]
The newly armed drones were being tested when the World Trade Center was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. The first drone strike in Afghanistan, piloted by U.S. Air Force operators directed by CIA analysts, happened on Oct. 7, 2001, a failed attempt to kill Taliban Supreme Commander Mohammed Omar . The first known killing by armed drones occurred in Nov. 2001, when a Predator killed Muhammad Atef, al-Qaeda’s military commander. [129] [130]
U.S. President George W. Bush signed a directive creating a secret list of high-value targets, allowing the CIA to kill the listed people without further presidential approval. The CIA under the Bush Administration mostly engaged in “personality” strikes, targeting known terrorists whose identities had been firmly established through intelligence, including visual surveillance and electronic and human intelligence. In 2008 the CIA began a policy of “signature strikes” against targets outside named kill lists, targeting individuals on the basis of their “pattern of life” or their suspicious daily behavior. In Pakistan in 2009 and 2010 as many as half of the 170 strikes were classified as signature strikes. [54] [90] [105]
The United States has operated drones with the tacit consent of the leaders of Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Afghanistan. The parliaments and governing bodies of these countries, however, often issued public statements blasting the strikes, and public sentiment has been strongly anti-drone. [49] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [106] [107] [108] [109]
Number of Strikes and Casualties
According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, there were at least 14,040 confirmed strikes between Jan. 2002 and Jan. 2019. Between 8,858 and 16,901 people were killed, including 910 to 2,200 civilians, of whom 283 to 454 were children. [131]
The organization counted at least 336 strikes in Yemen between Jan. 2002 and Jan 2019, with a peak of 50 strikes in Mar. 2017. The strikes resulted in 1,020 to 1,389 people reported killed, among them 174 to 225 civilians, of whom 44 to 50 were children. An additional 155 to 303 people were injured by drone strikes in Yemen. [131]
In Pakistan, between Jan. 2005 and Jan. 2018, there were at least 430 confirmed drone strikes, with a peak of 23 strikes in Sep. 2010. At least 2,515 to 4,026 people were reported killed, including a minimum of 424 civilians, of whom at least 172 were children. An additional 1,162 to 1,749 people were reported injured. [131]
There were at least 202 confirmed drone strikes in Somalia between Jan. 2007 and Feb. 2020, with a peak of 15 strikes in Feb. 2019. Between 1,197 and 1,410 people were killed, including 12 to 97 civilians, among whom up to 13 were children. Another 39 to 58 were injured by drone strikes in Somalia. [131]
At least 13,072 drone strikes were carried out in Afghanistan between Jan. 2015 and Mar. 2020, with a peak of 1,113 strikes in Sept. 2019. Between 4,126 and 10,076 people were killed, including 300 to 909 civilians, of whom 66 to 184 were children. An additional 658 to 1,769 people were injured by the strikes. [131]
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism shuttered in the spring of 2020, leaving researchers without an independent source for the number of drone strikes and casualties.
Public Outcry
In a Freedom of Information Act request filed on Jan. 13, 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) asked the U.S. government to disclose the legal and factual basis for its use of drones to conduct targeted killings abroad. In particular, the ACLU sought to find out when, where, and against whom drone strikes may be authorized and how the United States ensures compliance with international laws relating to extrajudicial killings. A federal appeals court judge ruled on Mar. 15, 2013 that the CIA may no longer assert the “fiction” that it can’t reveal whether it has a drone program. [110] [111] [112]
Much of the public outcry about drones has been about the government’s secrecy and lack of transparency concerning drone strikes and how many civilians are killed. Under the stewardship of John O. Brennan , President Barack Obama ’s counter-terrorism adviser from Jan. 20, 2009 to Mar. 8, 2013, officials spent months discussing how to be more transparent about a program that was still officially secret and how to define its limits. [117]
On May 23, 2013, Obama released “Fact Sheet: U.S. Policy Standards and Procedures for the Use of Force in Counterterrorism Operations Outside the United States and Areas of Active Hostilities,” which listed five criteria that must be met before lethal action may be taken against a foreign target:
“1. Near certainty that the terrorist target is present;
“1. Near certainty that the terrorist target is present;
2. Near certainty that non-combatants will not be injured or killed;
2. Near certainty that non-combatants will not be injured or killed;
3. An assessment that capture is not feasible at the time of the operation;
3. An assessment that capture is not feasible at the time of the operation;
4. An assessment that the relevant governmental authorities in the country where action is contemplated cannot or will not effectively address the threat to U.S. persons; and
4. An assessment that the relevant governmental authorities in the country where action is contemplated cannot or will not effectively address the threat to U.S. persons; and
5. An assessment that no other reasonable alternatives exist to effectively address the threat to U.S. persons.” [33]
5. An assessment that no other reasonable alternatives exist to effectively address the threat to U.S. persons.”
President Obama gave a speech the same day at the National Defense University outlining his justification for the drone program and promising more transparency and tighter policies regarding targeted killings. Obama stated that the United States would take military action only against a “continuing and imminent threat to the American people.” [10]
On Oct. 15, 2015, the “Drone Papers,” a collection of classified documents about the U.S. drone program were released by an anonymous whistleblower. Among the revelations were that up to 90 percent of all U.S. drone killings in a five-month period were not of the intended targets, and that unintended deaths from strikes were classified as “enemies killed in action” regardless of whether the casualties were civilians or combatants. [120] [121] [122] [132] [133]
On July 1, 2016, Obama issued an executive order with the goal of making the drones program more transparent. Among the polices were measures to reduce civilian casualties, acknowledgment of civilians killed in strikes, and an annual report on the number of strikes outside active hostilities, the number of casualties broken down by combatants and noncombatants, and reasons for discrepancies between governmental and nongovernmental organizations’ casualty counts. [134] [135]
Donald Trump Administration
President Donald Trump revoked the July 1, 2016, executive order in 2019, stating “This action eliminates superfluous reporting requirements, requirements that do not improve government transparency, but rather distract our intelligence professionals from their primary mission.” Rights groups and lawmakers decried the enhanced secrecy and apparent lack of accountability. [136]
In July 2020 the Trump administration also loosened rules on exporting military armed drones to foreign nations, a practice that was previously de facto banned. [138]
In the first two years of the Trump administration, there were 2,243 drone strikes, compared with 1,878 in the eight years of the Obama administration, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Airwars reported 40 airstrikes in Somalia between Jan. 1, 2020 and May 18, 2020, compared with 41 airstrikes in Somalia from 2007 to 2016. [136] [137]
A Jan. 23, 2020 poll, after the Jan. 3 drone strikes that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani , found that 35% of Americans agreed that drone strikes were a “very effective way to achieve US foreign policy,” an increase from 23% in 2015. Fewer people believed that signing international agreements (29%), imposing sanctions (23%), or launching military interventions (17%) were very effective. Meanwhile, 47% supported President Trump’s decision to order the strikes that killed Soleimani and others. [140] [141]
Joe Biden Administration
In October 2022 the administration of President Joe Biden tightened rules for drone strikes, including requiring that drone operators get permission from Biden himself to “target a suspected militant outside a conventional war zone” and requiring that operators “have ‘near certainty’ at the moment of any strike that civilians will not be injured.” Strikes were also limited to operations in which capture by a commando raid was not feasible. Targets who were American triggered more-extensive reviews. [158]
After continued Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea and American forces in Jordan , President Biden authorized strikes against Houthi targets in the Red Sea and Yemen (where the Houthi movement is centered) with support from the United Kingdom . The Department of Defense did not confirm which weapons were being used against Houthi forces, but experts believed that Standard Missile-2 missiles were being shot from warships in the Red Sea (meaning $2.1-million missiles were being used against drones costing a mere $2,000). [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] [164]
Second Trump Administration
The Trump administration expanded a previously undisclosed CIA drone program, begun under the Biden administration, in which drones are flown over Mexico. The drones are not equipped to conduct airstrikes but to collect information, such as the location of fentanyl labs, which can be easily detected from the air due to the chemicals they emit. [171]

Pro 1: Drone strikes make the United States safer.
Between 2013 and 2020, drone strikes in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia killed between 7,665 and 14,247 militants and alleged militants, including high-level commanders implicated in organizing plots against the United States. [6] [7] [8] [9] [131]
According to President Obama, “Dozens of highly skilled al Qaeda commanders, trainers, bomb makers and operatives have been taken off the battlefield. Plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European cities and our troops in Afghanistan. Simply put, these strikes have saved lives.” [10]
Beyond killing terrorists, that drones are remotely piloted saves American military lives. Drones are launched from bases in allied countries and are operated remotely by pilots in the United States, minimizing the risk of injury and death that would occur if ground soldiers and airplane pilots were used instead. The United States has the right under international law to “anticipatory self-defense,” which gives the right to use force against a real and imminent threat when the necessity of that self-defense is “instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation.” [18] [28]
Al-Qaeda, the Taliban , and their affiliates have often operated in distant and environmentally unforgiving locations where it would be extremely dangerous for the United States to deploy teams of special forces to track and capture terrorists. Such pursuits may pose serious risks to U.S. and allied troops including firefights with surrounding tribal communities, antiaircraft shelling, land mines, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), suicide bombers, snipers, dangerous weather conditions, and harsh environments. Drone strikes eliminate all of those risks common to “boots on the ground” missions. [10]
“Obtaining armed drones leads to about six fewer terrorist attacks and 31 fewer deaths from terrorism annually. This translates to a 35 percent reduction in attacks and a 75 percent decrease in fatalities per year….There is indeed a compelling counterterrorism rationale for utilizing armed drones to enhance national security. Although armed drone operations can be costly—for example, by causing civilian casualties—our findings strengthen the case that the benefits exceed the costs,” say Joshua A. Schwartz, postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Kennedy School, Matthew Fuhrmann, professor of political science at Texas A&M University, and Michael C. Horowitz, Richard Perry Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. [165] [166]
Pro 2: Drone strikes keep other countries safer.
U.S. drone strikes help countries fight terrorist threats to their own domestic peace and stability—threats including al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan, al-Shabaab in Somalia, al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, and al-Qaeda in the Maghreb in Algeria and Mali.
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia have officially consented to U.S. drone strikes within their countries, because they are unable to control terrorist groups within their own borders. [26]
On Aug. 21, 2020, for example, acting in cooperation with the Somali National Army, a U.S. drone strike killed a “high-ranking” al-Shabaab bomb and IED (improvised explosive device) maker. [144]
Yemen’s former president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, openly praised drone strikes in his country, stating that the “electronic brain’s precision is unmatched by the human brain.” [34]
In a 2008 U.S. State Department cable made public by Wikileaks, the Pakistani chief of army staff General Ashfaq Kayani asked U.S. officials for more drone strikes, and in Apr. 2013 former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf acknowledged to CNN that his government had secretly signed off on U.S. drone strikes. [35] [36]
In Pakistan, where the vast majority of drone strikes are carried out, drones contributed to a major decrease in violence. The 41 suicide attacks in Pakistan in 2011 were down from a record high of 87 in 2009, which coincided with an over tenfold increase in the number of drone strikes. [37]
After the Jan. 2020 strike that killed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps major general Soleimani in Iran, President Trump stated, “Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years.…Just recently, Soleimani led the brutal repression of protesters in Iran, where more than a thousand innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government.…The future belongs to the people of Iran—those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation—not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad.” [145]
Pro 3: Drones limit the scope, scale, and casualties of military action.
Invading Pakistan, Yemen, or Somalia with boots on the ground to capture relatively small terrorist groups would lead to expensive conflict, responsibility for destabilizing the governments of those countries, large numbers of civilian casualties, empowerment of enemies who view the United States as an occupying imperialist power, and U.S. military deaths, among other consequences. The U.S. attempt to destroy al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan by invading and occupying the country resulted in a war that dragged on for 13 years. Using drone strikes against terrorists abroad allows the United States to achieve its goals at a fraction of the cost of an invasion in money, manpower, lives, and other political consequences. [142] [143]
Drones are launched from bases in allied countries and are operated remotely by pilots in the United States, minimizing the risk of injury and death that would occur if ground soldiers and airplane pilots were used instead. Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and their affiliates often operate in distant and environmentally unforgiving locations where it would be extremely dangerous for the United States to deploy teams of special forces to track and capture terrorists. Such pursuits would pose serious risks to U.S. troops including firefights with surrounding tribal communities, antiaircraft shelling, land mines, IEDs, suicide bombers, snipers, dangerous weather conditions, and harsh environments. [10] [18]
Furthermore, drone pilots suffer less than traditional pilots, because they do not have to be directly present on the battlefield, can live a normal civilian life in the United States, and do not risk death or serious injury. Only 4% of active-duty drone pilots are at “high risk for PTSD” compared with the 12–17% of soldiers who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. [46]
The traditional weapons of war—bombs, shells, mines, mortars—cause more collateral (unintended) damage to people and property than drones, whose accuracy and technical precision limit casualties mostly to combatants and intended targets. Between 2013 and 2020, civilians accounted for just 7–15% of those killed by drones in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. In the Korean, Vietnam, and Balkan Wars, civilian deaths accounted for approximately 70%, 31%, and 45% of deaths, respectively. Civilian deaths in World War II are estimated to have been 40–67% of total war deaths. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [131]
Former U.S. secretary of defense Robert Gates stated, “You can far more easily limit collateral damage with a drone than you can with a bomb, even a precision-guided munition, off an airplane.” And former CIA director Leon Panetta and former State Department legal adviser Harold Hongju Koh concurred, both using the word “precise” to describe drone strikes.

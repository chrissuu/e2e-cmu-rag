In honor of the 45th anniversary of Pittsburgh’s Creative and Performing Arts School (CAPA), the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is proud to present an exhibition of artwork recognizing the talents of CAPA faculty and alumni. Known for fostering creativity, innovation, and excellence, CAPA has shaped the artistic landscape of Pittsburgh for nearly half a century, inspiring countless young artists to pursue their passions and refine their crafts.
This exhibition shows works that highlight the wide breadth of artistic talent that has emerged from this creative institution. From traditional fine art to innovative product design and documentary film, the selection reflects the expansive range of talent nurtured at CAPA. It underscores how public arts education fosters both artistic growth and real-world opportunity.
While many CAPA alumni pursue careers beyond the arts, including in art-adjacent fields, an artistic sensibility developed in young adulthood remains a lifelong gift. When art fosters a shared sense of understanding, studying the arts becomes a lasting commitment to empathy, imagination, and curiosity - qualities that extend well beyond the classroom, as is evidenced by the works in this exhibition.
This celebrates a long-standing tradition of artistic excellence and the dedication that has helped define Pittsburgh’s cultural identity. The exhibition stands as a testament to the transformative power of public arts education and the creative energy it inspires throughout our communities.

Whenever you borrow money—whether it’s taking out a mortgage to buy a home, or loans to finance
                    an automobile,
                    pay for college, or even start that microbrewery you’ve always dreamed about—you need to know
                    the terms.
Loan amount. How much do you need (or are you allowed) to borrow?
Loan term. When do you plan to have the loan paid in full?
Compound frequency and payback rate. How often will you make payments, and
                        how often will
                        those payments be reflected in your outstanding balance? (Typically they’re both the
                        same—monthly or
                        annually, for example.)
Once you know those things, you can calculate your expected payments.
For example, suppose you plan to buy a $30,000 car. You have enough for a $2,000 down payment,
                    and the dealer
                    is offering you $3,000 for your current vehicle, so your loan amount would be $25,000 . Let’s say the finance
                    department has offered you a five-year loan, with monthly payback, at their 4.99% “incentive rate.”
Use the calculator to find out your monthly payment: $471.67.

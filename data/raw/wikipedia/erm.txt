The role of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is to provide the governance, framework, and guidance to assist and support campus leadership and stakeholders in identifying events that have the potential to impact the CMU community both positively and negatively, and to manage risks associated with those events.
The goals are to support organizational resiliency with a risk-conscious culture that aligns to the strategic mission and values of the university . This is achieved by enabling the understanding of actual risks and their criticality through the development of effective and efficient mitigation planning, and the proactive identification and management of emerging risks to prevent future issues.

We require the TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge or Duolingo English Test from all nonnative English speakers. If English isn't one of your first languages, you must submit official results from one of the following options:
IELTS (or IELTS Online) : We require at least a 7.5 overall band score on the Academic Examination and give consideration to those with subscores of 7.5 and above.
TOEFL iBT or iBT Home Edition : We require at least a 102 overall score and give consideration to those with subscores of 25 and above.
TOEFL Essentials : We require at least an 11 overall band score and give consideration to those with subscores of 11 and above.
Cambridge English Assessment : We require at least a 191 overall score and give consideration to those with subscores of 191 and above.
Duolingo English Test: we require at least a 135 overall score and give consideration to those with the following subscores and above:
Literacy: 135
Conversation: 135
Comprehension: 135
Production: 135
Scores should be no more than two years old at the time of application, and we prefer that you submit all English proficiency test results from the past two years.
Should you take the TOEFL more than once, we'll use the set of TOEFL scores corresponding with your highest overall score. We don't use TOEFL MyBest scores, which ‘superscore’ subsection results from more than one test administration of the TOEFL.
Please plan on taking the TOEFL or IELTS no later than December of your senior year. Make sure that the name you use for test registration is identical to the way your name is listed on your passport and in your admissions application.

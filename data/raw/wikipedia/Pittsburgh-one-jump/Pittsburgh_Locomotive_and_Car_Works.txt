The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works was a railroad equipment manufacturing company founded by Andrew Carnegie and T.N. Miller in 1865. It was located in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh and since 1907 part of that city.

It repaired an early locomotive known as Bausman's Rhinoceros in April 1867.[1] 
Starting in the 1870s under its superintendent and general manager Daniel A. Wightman, it became known for its production of large locomotives.  Its engines were shipped around the world, including India and Japan.

By 1901, when Pittsburgh had merged with seven other manufacturing companies to form American Locomotive Company (ALCO), Pittsburgh had produced over 2,400 locomotives.  In March 1919, ALCO closed the Pittsburgh facility.

Following is a list (in serial number order) of Pittsburgh locomotives built before the ALCO merger that have been spared the scrapper's torch.[2]

Listed below (likewise in serial number order) are preserved locomotives that were built at the Pittsburgh facility after the ALCO merger.

State College is a borough and home rule municipality in Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a college town, home to the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University.

State College is the largest designated borough in Pennsylvania.[5] It is the principal borough of the six municipalities that make up the State College area, the largest settlement in Centre County and one of the principal cities of the greater State College-DuBois Combined Statistical Area with a combined population of 236,577 as of the 2010 U.S. census. In the 2010 census, the borough population was 42,034.[5]

The Delaware, Iroquois, Mingo, and Shawnee were some of the first native inhabitants who began establishing settlements, farms, and trails throughout the valley and its water gaps.[6][7]

The name of the Nittany Valley and its most prominent feature, Mount Nittany, comes from either Shawnee, Iroquois, or Lenape. It is thought to be a place name roughly translating to "single mountain."[8] A common myth suggests the name comes from princess Nita-Nee, who led her people to the fertile valleys of central Pennsylvania. The author of the story, Henry W. Shoemaker, later admitted that the legend was "purely fictitious," although the myth persists to this day.[9] Waupelani Drive is named after Chief Woapalanne.[10]

The Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania was founded in 1855 on 400-acres of land in what was Harris Township.[11] Although the area was isolated from most of the state,[12] the land was reasonably affordable and the Nittany Valley was rich in limestone, causing exceptional soil fertility.[13] The land was clear-cut for charcoal, powering the adjacent Centre Furnace. In 1862 the school was renamed to The Agricultural College of Pennsylvania.[13]

In 1875, College Township formed, taking up most of what is now State College.[14] In 1885, the Pennsylvania Railroad opened a train station two miles from campus in Lemont on the Lewisburg and Tyrone Railroad.[12] Passengers would have to catch an autobus or a hack to complete the journey to State College from the new station.[12] Construction of the train station on West College Avenue was finally completed in 1892, connecting State College to the Bellefonte Central Railroad (BCRR) via Struble. The journey along the 20-mile-long line took 50 minutes, meandering through the Scotia Barrens and the Buffalo Run Valley south of the Bald Eagle Ridge before making it to Bellefonte.[15] On August 29, 1896, State College officially separated from College Township forming a borough.[16]

In 1909 the hilly area south of Downtown began to be developed under the name Highland Park.[17] The borough began expanding in 1916 with annexations from Ferguson and College Township. In 1917 the borough added the Hamilton,[18] Highland Park,[19] and South Side[20] additions to its boundary. Regular passenger trains were discontinued in 1917, while mixed passenger and freight trains continued until 1945.[21]

In 1930, the BCRR built a line from State College to Fairbrook, though it ceased using the line in 1933 due to the economic impact of the Great Depression.[21] Compared to the rest the country, State College was much more economically stable due to the expanding Pennsylvania State University.[22] This led to State College and the surrounding townships being nicknamed "Happy Valley."[23] The borough expanded throughout the 1930s with three more annexations, including Lytle's Addition.[24] In 1940, State College eclipsed Bellefonte in population with around 6,226 people.[22]

The influx of veterans returning from the war led to a post-war building boom from 1946 to 1947 especially around the Highlands and South End.[24] Windcrest, a trailer park community built to accommodate returning veterans, was rented to married student veteran families.[25]

In 1951, the Penn State Nittany Lions men's soccer team flew to Iran following a request from U.S. State Department. The team was meant to play several exhibition matches in an attempt to "further goodwill" between the United States and Iran. The Nittany Lions lost their first match in Isfahan 2–0 in front of 5,000 spectators.[26]

On January 21, 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech on desegregation to an audience of about 8,000 community members and students in Rec Hall.[27]

In 1970 attempts were made by university students to divest money from the Applied Research Laboratory, which produces torpedoes. A sit-in at Old Main led to the arrest of at least 30 people. Protests against the ARL escalated in 1972 when about 2,000 protesters blocking College Avenue and North Atherton Street were met with police in riot gear. The following day more than 5,000 protesters marched to the ARL, which temporarily shut down at the request of the university and Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline.[28]

In 1973, State College adopted a home rule charter which took effect in 1976;[29] since then, it has not been governed by the state's Borough Code, although it retains "Borough of State College" as its official name.

The university has a post office address in University Park, Pennsylvania. When it changed its name from Pennsylvania State College to The Pennsylvania State University in 1953, its president, Milton S. Eisenhower, sought to persuade the town to change its name as well.[30] A referendum failed to yield a majority for any of the choices proposed as a new name, so the town remains State College.

State College remained resistant to the economic shocks of the 2008 Great Recession[31] as it did during the Great Depression.[23] This led to a wave of investment into high-rises and other construction projects in the area.[32] The tallest building in State College, the Fraser Centre, was finished in 2015.[33] There have been several other high-rises built in Downtown State College since the Fraser Centre was completed, and one in the West End.[34]

Beginning in 2015 the borough council voted to change the name of State College to "City of THON" for 46 hours in honor of THON, the largest student-run philanthropic organization in the world,[35] a tradition that would continue every year since.[36]

On March 20, 2019, State College police officer Jordan Pieniazek shot and killed Osaze Osagie, a 29-year-old man, during a wellness check.[37] An investigation by the state police was passed down to the district attorney of Centre County, Bernie Cantorna, who determined that the shooting was justified.[38] Protests began after the district attorney's report was released on May 8, 2019.[38] On May 31, 2020, thousands took part in a protest downtown against police brutality with an emphasis on the killings of George Floyd and Osaze Osagie.[39] It became one of the largest protests in the county's history.[40] Demonstrations would continue for years, including a 24-hour occupation of the State College Borough municipal building in November 2020[41] and a march in 2021 outside the Marvin Gardens apartments where Osagie was fatally shot.[42][43] In 2023, the federal judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Matthew William Brann, dissmised a lawsuit against the borough and police involved.[42] March 20 was declared “Osaze Osagie Day of Remembrance” by the State College Borough in 2023.[44] Osagie's parents established two scholarships, The Osaze's Heart Community Service Scholarship for racially underrepresented State High seniors,[45] and The Osaze Olufemi Osagie Memorial Scholarship for Educational Equity for Penn State students with intellectual and mental health diagnoses.[46][47]

The borough became the first municipality in Pennsylvania to pass a resolution for a ceasefire in the Gaza war.[48] The measure passed unanimously on December 20, 2023[49] after months of marches and demonstrations.[50] A copy of the resolution was forwarded to President Joe Biden; senators John Fetterman and Bob Casey Jr.; and representative Glenn Thompson.[48]

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 4.5 square miles (12 km2), all land. It is surrounded by large tracts of farmland and an expanse of Appalachian Mountain ranges and forests. Its location within a valley makes it prone to frequent rain, snowfall, and flooding.[51]  State College is in the Susquehanna watershed.[52] The borough is the nexus, and most populous municipality in Happy Valley. State College is also a part of the larger Nittany Valley. The Nittany Valley is part of the geologic ridge-and-valley province of the Appalachian Mountains.[53] It is located at the approximate geographic center of Pennsylvania. The borough is bordered by Ferguson and College Township.

The Borough of State College has twelve neighborhoods and half of University Park. The Highlands have around ten thousand people, making it the largest neighborhood in the borough, followed by Downtown and Orchard Park.[54] The Highlands are a mix of apartments, townhouses, single-family homes, businesses, and parks. The neighborhood features working class areas like Lytle Hill and Marvin Gardens, and student areas like Frat Row. The Holmes–Foster–Highlands Historic District includes parts of Holmes-Foster, the Highlands, and the West End. Holmes-Foster and the West End were two of the first neighborhoods to be developed due to their proximity to Downtown, University Park, and the Bellefonte Central Railroad.[55] Part of College Heights makes up the College Heights Historic District which was created in 1935 and features the College Heights Service Station.[56][57] It took six annexations from College Township from 1930 to 1968 to officially bring the South End and Nittany Hills (also Penfield) neighborhoods in the borough.[24] Vallamont and Penfield are the least populated neighborhoods, both of which are in the foothills of Mount Nittany on the east side of town.[54] Parkway, short for Westerly Parkway Plaza, is home to State High, the Delta Program, the Westerly Parkway Wetlands,[58] and the Parkway Plaza Apartments, which were built in the 1960s.[59] Orchard Park is home to the South Hills School of Business & Technology. Residents of Downtown (99%), the West End (96%), and Orchard Park (89%) are largely renters; whereas Greentree (93%), College Heights (70%), and Penfield (68%) residents are predominately homeowners.[54]

Downtown bring in over two million tourists a year, and features 25 major festivals, including Arts Fest,[60] Latin Festival,[61] Fall Festival,[62] and First Night festival.[63] The neighborhood is home to Schlow Library, Memorial Field, Sydney Friedman Park, MLK Plaza, the State Theater, and several murals and art installations including the Calder Way Fresco, Dreams Take Flight, and the MLK Plaza mural depicting King's 1965 speech at Penn State.[64][65]

The 2010s saw a construction boom downtown, with several mixed-use towers developed, including Rise, Metropolitan, Fraser Centre, and Here State College, and others. Unlike older towers, many of the newer buildings are mixed-use, with retail on the ground floor, offices on the next couple floors up, and apartments on the top floors.[66][67]

The Downtown area has seen large protests over past the couple of decades,[68] particularly at the Allen Street Gates and the Martin Luther King Jr. Plaza. In recent years, marches for May Day,[69] Black Lives Matter,[70] trans rights,[71] and against Israeli war crimes have taken place in the Downtown streets.[72]

University Park is the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, and its split between the Borough of State College and College Township. It is home to Old Main, Penn State's first building of major significance, completed in 1863; Palmer Museum of Art, visual arts facility and cultural resource for Penn State and local community; and Penn State Creamery, the world's largest university creamery. University Park is also home to Beaver Stadium, the second-largest stadium in the Western Hemisphere and the home of Penn State Nittany Lions football and the Bryce Jordan Center, home of the Men's and Women's Penn State basketball and other indoor sports and entertainment events; although these structures are located in College Township.[73]

The Holmes–Foster–Highlands Historic District with 727 contributing buildings, and College Heights Historic District with 278 were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.[74] Houses come in popular early twentieth-century architectural styles including Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival, and Bungalow. The historic Camelot house is also in the Holmes–Foster–Highlands Historic District[75] while the College Heights Service Station and College Heights School are in the College Heights Historic District.[57][76]

State College has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa). Temperatures average 27.2 °F (−2.7 °C) in January and 72.2 °F (22.3 °C) in July.[77] Annual precipitation averages 41.53 inches (105 cm), with 43.8 inches (111 cm) of annual snowfall on average.[77] With a period of record dating back to 1893, the lowest temperature recorded was −20 °F (−29 °C) on February 10, 1899, and the highest was 102 °F (39 °C) on July 17, 1988, and July 9, 1936.[78]

Weather in State College is strongly influenced by the mountain and valley topology of the area. The surrounding mountains cause significantly lower temperatures in the winter, and make summer heat waves much rarer than in the rest of the state. Precipitation is about 20% lower than areas at comparable elevations, again due to the surrounding mountains. Snowfall typically occurs between October and April, but has happened as late as June.[79]

According to the 2010 census,[82] there were 42,034 people, 12,610 households, and 3,069 families residing in the borough. The population density was 9,258.6 inhabitants per square mile (3,574.8/km2). There were 13,007 housing units at an average density of 2,865.0 per square mile (1,106.2/km2).

The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.71.

The age distribution of the borough was overwhelmingly influenced by its student population: 5.1% of the population was under the age of 18, 70.6% from 18 to 24, 13.1% from 25 to 44, 6.5% from 45 to 64, and 4.7% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22 years.

Out of the total population, 10.6% of those under the age of 18 and 2.2% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. However, traditional measures of income and poverty can be very misleading when applied to a community like State College that is dominated by students.

In 1914, the State College School Board purchased a sinkhole along Fraser and Nittany avenues to build a football field and track in the “natural amphitheater.” During the Great Depression the project received a $40,000 grant from the Works Progress Administration, $5,000 from the school district, and additional federal funds.[95] The sinkhole was originally nicknamed "The Hollow", though it would later be named Memorial Field in dedication to State College High School graduates killed in both World Wars.[96] In September 1937, the stadium hosted its first football game between State College and Yeagertown. State College would win 52–7 in front of an audience of 3,000 spectators. $500,000 was spent on drainage to protect against flooding in the former sinkhole.[95] In 1966 the area between Memorial Field and the post office was turned into a parklet. Originally named Central Parklet, the parks name was changed in 2009 to Sidney Friedman Park after Altoona-born business owner and real estate mogul Sidney Friedman died.[97]

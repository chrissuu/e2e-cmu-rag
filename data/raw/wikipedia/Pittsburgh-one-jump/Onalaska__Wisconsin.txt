Onalaska (/ˌɒnəˈlæskə/ ⓘ ON-ə-LASS-kə)[4] is a city in La Crosse County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 18,803 at the 2020 census. It borders the larger La Crosse, Wisconsin, and is a part of the La Crosse-Onalaska, WI-MN Metropolitan Area.[5]

Onalaska is built on a slightly elevated ridge above the Black River.  Natural areas include both river bottom land and high, heavily wooded, scenic bluffs. A man-made reservoir at the city's western edge is known as Lake Onalaska. Onalaska is known as "The Sunfish Capital of the World."

The original village (now city) was platted by Thomas G. Rowe (New York) and John C. Laird (Pennsylvania) in 1851. In its early days, lumbering and related industries served as a basis for its economy.[6]

According to local legend, the city's name comes from the 1799 poem The Pleasures of Hope, by the Scottish poet Thomas Campbell, which makes one mention of "Oonalaska's shore" in a passage about the remote reaches of a sailor's explorations.[7] "Oonalaska" was an alternative spelling for Unalaska Island in Russian Alaska, one of the principal Aleutian Islands. Early settler Harvey Hubbard recounted that the poem was one of Thomas Rowe's favorites, leading him to choose the name.[8] However, local historian George Tabbert argued that the name was more likely inspired by the story of a Lenape woman named Onalaska who died around 1780 in what is now Richland County, Ohio. By the 1840s, the woman's name was used in a variety of places, including a New York ferryboat that Rowe would likely have been familiar with.[9] Other places named Onalaska are in Arkansas (now defunct), Texas, and Washington.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.97 square miles (28.41 km2), of which 10.38 square miles (26.88 km2) is land and 0.60 square miles (1.55 km2) is water.[10]

Onalaska lies immediately north of La Crosse, on the Black River. It is the second-largest city in La Crosse County, Wisconsin.

Named streams within the current corporate limits of the city include the Black River, the La Crosse River and Sand Lake Coulee Creek. In the 1930s, the construction of Lake Onalaska resulted in the flooding and eventual disappearance of a shallow, natural body of water, Rice Lake, and several smaller ponds in the Black River bottoms area.

Brice Prairie is an urban reserve area within the City of Onalaska, located below the ridge on which most of the city is situated. It lies to the northwest of the city's current northern border and is directly on Lake Onalaska.

The Lansing–East Lansing Metropolitan Statistical Area is a metropolitan area located in Central Michigan defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and encompassing the counties of Eaton, Clinton, and Ingham. The region is colloquially referred to as "Mid" or Central Michigan, and less often as "Greater Lansing" or the "Capital Area". As of the 2020 census, the MSA had a population of 473,203. It ranks as Michigan's third-largest metropolitan area behind metropolitan Detroit and Grand Rapids.

The metropolitan area was originally defined as only including Ingham County in 1950, but Eaton and Clinton counties were added in 1960. Ionia County was added in 1973, but taken out a decade later for the 1990 Census.[4] Shiawassee County was added in 2018 after commuting flows increased enough for it to qualify as an "outlying county"[5] but was removed when core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) were re-delineated in 2023.[6] It forms a combined statistical area (CSA) with Metro Lansing designated the Lansing-East Lansing-Owosso, MI CSA.

The Lansing Urban Area, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, which measures the extent of the built-up area, had a population of 313,532 as of the 2010 census.

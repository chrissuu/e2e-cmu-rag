Tredyffrin Township ( /trɪˈdɪfrɪn/ Welsh: [trɛˈdɘfrɪn]) is a township located in eastern Chester County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 29,332 at the 2010 census.

Settled in the late 17th century, Tredyffrin is bounded by Delaware and Montgomery counties.   It includes on its northern boundary a small part of Valley Forge National Historical Park, where George Washington encamped during the American War of Independence.  Tredyffrin and the entire Great Valley region also have many limestone deposits. Tredyffrin is the most populous township in Chester County.

Unincorporated communities within Tredyffrin Township include Chesterbrook, Strafford, a portion of Paoli, and a portion of Wayne, Howellville at the intersection of Swedesford and Howellville Roads, and East Howellville, along Howellville Road, west of the intersection of Howellville Road and the border between Tredyffrin and Easttown Townships. Tredyffrin is bordered by Easttown, East Whiteland, Willistown, Charlestown, Upper Merion, Radnor and Schuylkill townships.

On March 13, 1684, William Penn decided to set aside a portion of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania for settlements for Welsh immigrants.  This area, known as the "Welsh Tract", was surveyed in 1684 and included several modern-day townships, including Tredyffrin.  Although the Welsh Tract was originally meant to be a self-ruling municipality, it was divided between Chester County and Philadelphia when that county was created in 1685, and the Welsh subsequently submitted to the authority of Chester County.   In 1707, Tredyffrin was incorporated as a township.   This name comes from the Welsh tre(f), which means "town", joined to dyffryn, which means "wide, cultivated valley".   Tredyffrin was quick to develop into a thriving township.  In 1710, the first mill in Tredyffrin was started by Thomas Jerman on what is now North Valley Road.   Swedesford Road, one of the first roads in the township, was created by 1718.

As the population of the township grew, with 30 resident landowners in 1722 and 83 in 1774, churches sprung up to meet the demand by religious residents.  In 1710, the Baptist minister Hugh Davis moved to the Great Valley from Britain and, there being several Baptist families in this area, the Baptist Church in the Great Valley was formed on April 22, 1711.  The church originally met in Radnor.  However, there were enough members of this Baptist church that by 1722, a log building was erected in Tredyffrin to serve the congregation.

As Tredyffrin includes part of Valley Forge National Historical Park, there are many Revolutionary War-related sites in the township, especially the park and houses where various generals were quartered.

Development in the township was sparked in the 19th century by construction and advertisement of the "Main Line" railroad service, which terminated in Paoli, which straddles the western border of the township.

Tredyffrin-Easttown school district was unusual for the area in being racially integrated during the early part of the century.[3] In 1932, the district planned to segregate after building a new school, and African Americans in the township boycotted the school system for two years in protest (the "School Fight"). In 1934 a negotiated settlement was reached whereby the schools remained integrated, and helped kill school segregation in Pennsylvania.

During the Cold War, a Nike anti-aircraft missile site was active in the township. It was located off Le Boutillier Road, near Swedesford Road.

The rocks of Tredyffrin were laid down in the upper Paleozoic, meaning that they are primarily metamorphic. Limestone is often at the surface in the Great Valley, so many limestone kilns were created in the 18th century. Mine owner William Rennyson sold the fizzy water from his Howellville limestone quarry as "Tredyffrin Water" around 1900.[13] The northern edge of the township is a ridge of quartzite and sandstone (the Cambrian Chickies Formation) including Valley Forge Mountain (or Mount Misery), which was mined for quartz in the 18th century through the mid-19th century.

Tredyffrin Township Libraries operates Tredyffrin Public Library and Paoli Library.[16]

The Tredyffrin Library, with 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2) of space as of 1977, is located in the Strafford community.[17] The architectural firm Mitchell/Giurgola developed the Tredyffrin Library. It has an amphitheater that is focused on a park in a southward direction.[18] The library has a single large reading room.[17] The library building has a larger two-story end, while the other end has only one story at the upper level.[19] Offices at the main level are in a separate element of the structure from the main reading room, and this structure juts out from the flue. Architectural Record said that this "allows direct access to the reading room from the public entrance."[17] In 1990 a new children's library was created on the lower level of the building in previously unfinished space.[20]

As the community continued to grow and change, plans were finalized in 2004 to renovate and expand Tredyffrin Library. In September 2007, the library broke ground for a $6 million renovation and expansion. On January 31, 2009, the entire expanded building was open to the public for the first time.[20]

Architectural Record stated that Tredyffrin Library and the library built in Condon Hall of the University of Washington School of Law, which was also designed by Mitchell/Giurgola, have common underlying concepts. According to the publication, the shared concepts were "unusual sensitivity in using natural light to best advantage while warding off the sun," a "quickly apparent organization of functions," and being "responsive to the varying situations in which it is built."[18]

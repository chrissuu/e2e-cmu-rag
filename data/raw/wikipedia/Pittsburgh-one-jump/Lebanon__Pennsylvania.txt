Lebanon (/ˈlɛbənən/ LEB-ən-ən; Pennsylvania German: Lebnen [ˈlɛbnən]) is a city[4] in and the county seat of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, United States.[5] The population was 26,814 at the 2020 census.

Lebanon was founded by George Steitz in 1740 and was originally named Steitztown.[6]

Lebanon is located 61 miles (98 km) southwest of Allentown, 26 miles (42 km) east of Harrisburg, and 88 miles (142 km) northwest of Philadelphia.

Indigenous nations in the area of what is now Lebanon included the Shawnee, Susquehannock, Gawanese, Lenape (or Delaware), and Nanticoke peoples.[7]

Lebanon was settled by European colonists in 1720, many with the family names of "Steitz" and "Light", along a creek that was then named "Steitz Creek". The Light patriarchs built a fort to protect against Indians and named it "Light's Fort". The town was laid out in 1753, incorporated as a borough on February 20, 1821, and became a city on November 25, 1885. It adopted the commission form of government, consisting of four councilmen and a mayor.

Lebanon bologna was first made here, since before the 1780s.[8] The Union Canal, which operated from 1828 to 1885, flowed through the city's north side. San Giorgio pasta has been manufactured in Lebanon since 1914,[9] and was acquired by nearby Hershey Foods Corporation in 1966.[10] Lebanon was formerly home to a major steel mill operated by Bethlehem Steel.

Lebanon, Pennsylvania is thought to be named after the ancient Middle Eastern nation of Lebanon, however. Locals consistently pronounce the Pennsylvania city's name /ˈlɛbənən/ ("Leb-a-nin") and many shorten it to two syllables—"Leb-nin" or even "Lep-nin." The latter is particularly identified with Pennsylvania Dutch heritage.[18]

An infamous 1878 murder near Fort Indiantown Gap resulted in a trial of six defendants who all had blue eyes. They were given the moniker the Blue-eyed Six by a newspaper reporter who attended the trial, held in the Lebanon county courthouse. Five of the six defendants were hanged at the county jail. The trial received worldwide publicity and provided inspiration to Arthur Conan Doyle in writing the Sherlock Holmes short story "The Red-Headed League" (1891).[19]

At one point in history the Lebanon County courthouse and jail became the home of the popular Lebanon Farmers Market. After a time as a textile manufacturer, the market returned to the original 30,000 square foot Market House on South 8th street in 2003.

Lebanon is one of several Pennsylvania towns to drop or raise a unique item at midnight on New Year's Eve. Godshall's Quality Meats, owners of Weaver's Famous Lebanon Bologna, donates a 150-pound (68 kg) Lebanon bologna for the annual festivity. It is encased in a metal frame and suspended from a fire department ladder truck, and donated to a local rescue mission after the celebration.[20]

In December 2008, the TV show Dirty Jobs, hosted by Mike Rowe, visited the Seltzer's Smokehouse Meats to film production of Lebanon bologna.[21]  In 2008 the show featured the Wertz Candy Shop.[22][23]

In 2010, an independent film drama Lebanon, PA was made.[24] The movie was set in Lebanon and some scenes were filmed in the city and surrounding  county.

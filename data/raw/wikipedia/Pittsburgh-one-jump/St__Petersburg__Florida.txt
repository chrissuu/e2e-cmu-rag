St. Petersburg is a city in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 258,308, making it the fifth-most populous city in Florida and the most populous city in the state that is not a county seat (the city of Clearwater is the seat of Pinellas County).[4] It is the second-most populous city in the Tampa Bay area, which is the second-largest metropolitan area in Florida with an estimated population of about 3.29 million in 2022.[5]

St. Petersburg is located on the Pinellas peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and is connected to mainland Florida to the north. Locals often refer to the city as "St. Pete". Neighboring St. Pete Beach formally shortened its name in 1994 after a vote by its residents. St. Petersburg is governed by a mayor and city council.[6]

With an average of 361 days of sunshine annually, and a Guinness World Record for the most consecutive days of sunshine (768 days between 1967 and 1969),[7][8] it is nicknamed "The Sunshine City."[7] Located on the Gulf of Mexico, the average water temperature is typically around 76 °F (24 °C).[9] Due to its good weather, the city has long been a popular retirement destination, although in recent years the population has moved in a much more youthful direction.[10]

When the Spanish first arrived in the area of Tampa Bay, they encountered people of the Safety Harbor culture. About 20 sites with temple mounds have been found around Tampa Bay, with several in Pinellas County. Best known of the Safety Harbor people was the chiefdom of Tocobaga, which was likely located at the Safety Harbor site in Philippe Park in northern Pinellas County. The Pánfilo de Narváez expedition landed on the shores of Boca Ciega Bay at the Jungle Prada Site on April 14, 1528. It was the first inland exploration of North America. Of 300 men on the expedition only four survived. One of the survivors of the expedition, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, wrote the first book describing the peoples, wildlife, flora and fauna of inland North America in his Relacion, published in Spain in 1542.[11][12][13]

The city was co-founded by John C. Williams, formerly of Detroit, who purchased the land in 1875, and by Peter Demens, who was instrumental in bringing the terminus of the Orange Belt Railway there in 1888.[14] St. Petersburg was incorporated as a town on February 29, 1892, when it had a population of 300 people.[15][16][page needed]

Local lore claims John C. Williams and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming the city.[17][18] When Demens won the coin toss, the city was named after Saint Petersburg, Russia, where Peter Demens had spent half of his youth,[19] while John C. Williams named the first hotel after his birthplace, Detroit (a hotel built by Demens).[14][20] The Detroit Hotel still exists downtown on Central Ave, but has been turned into a condominium.[21]

The oldest operating hotels are the Pier Hotel (formally Hotel Cordova), built in 1921, and The Exchange Hotel (formally The Heritage Hotel), built in 1926.[22][23]

The first major newspaper to debut in Tampa Bay was the St. Petersburg Times which established in 1884.[24] Philadelphia publisher F. A. Davis turned on St. Petersburg's first electrical service in 1897.[25] The city's first major industry was born in 1899 when Henry W. Hibbs (1862–1942), a native of Newport, North Carolina, established his wholesale fish business at the end of the railroad pier, which extended out to the shipping channel. Within a year, Hibbs Fish Company was shipping more than 1,000 pounds (450 kg) of fish each day.[26]

A historic marker on the 2nd Avenue side of St. Peter's Episcopal Cathedral, facing Williams Park, notes that the cathedral and several adjacent churches played a central role in St. Petersburg being known as the "City of Churches." Among the oldest remaining structures downtown, St. Peter's was built in the Gothic Revival style in 1899, funded by philanthropist Edwin H. Tomlinson in honor of his father. The area surrounding Williams Park also features other historic congregations—including First Baptist, First Congregational, and First United Methodist—all established within a few decades of the city's founding in 1892. Architectural records indicate that of fewer than ten Gothic Revival buildings remaining citywide, seven churches were built between 1887 and 1925, most clustered around Williams Park and Central Avenue. Earlier still, the first Episcopal church in the area was established at Pinellas Point in 1887, prior to the city's own founding. This pattern of early church building by multiple denominations reflects how religious institutions served as foundational anchors in St. Petersburg's civic and cultural development—even before the city's official incorporation.[27]

The Episcopalians had the opportunity of establishing the first church in the southernmost part of St. Petersburg, Florida at Pinellas Point. There was a meeting held at the home of Robert Staunton on April 20, 1887, and it was planned to construct a church named St. Bartholomew's, on Lakeview Avenue. This church was completed late in 1887 and services were held there until 1895 when the property was given to the owners of the St. Peter's Church in St. Petersburg and were used for burial purposes. Hence another first Episcopalian church in St. Petersburg was created at the lot at Eleventh street and Second avenue north and was completed late in 1889.
Edwin H. Tomlinson was one of the earliest supporters of St. Petersburg, Florida, benefiting and blessing the city in many ways. In one such case, Edwin paid the price in full for the St. Peter's Church and construction of the church was completed early in 1899. In the context of St. Petersburg being nicknamed "The City of Churches," it is imperative to note how the first church and in fact many more churches were founded before even the city itself was (founded in 1888 and became a city in 1892). The various denominations of Christianity at the time practiced and planted their own churches in St. Petersburg. The order being the Episcopalian Church in 1887 then again in 1889, the Congregational Church in 1890 between Ninth and Tenth streets near the present Central avenue (the Presbyterians of the town joined forces with the Congregationalists to work together to accomplish it), the First Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church 1892 at Central avenue and First street, the First Baptist Church which began congregation in 1893 and built their church in 1896 at the southeast corner of Sixth street and Central avenue (the congregation worshipped in the First Methodist Church while the new church was being built), the Catholic Church in 1908 at Sixth street south between Fifth and Sixth avenues (the mass attended Point Pinellas beginning in 1892 and raised money to build this church in the meantime), the First Methodist Church built in 1892 at Central avenue and Seventh street, the First Christian Church built in 1909 at the corner of Second avenue and Fourth street south, the Grace Baptist Church built in 1909 at the railroad tracks on Fourth street south, the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church built in 1911 at Fifth street and Second avenue south, and First Church of Christ – Scientist (Christian Science Society) met in 1900 with fifteen people in the old Strowger building on the southeast corner of Central avenue and Fourth street – once the organization gathered more than sixteen members they had enough to be known as a church and an advertised practitioner – in 1913 the church bought a building at Second avenue north near Second street. In total 11 different denominations in these early founding days of the city planted their roots which were vital in helping guide these pioneers, were often a light for them, these churches were a beating heart for them – hence why these locations were built in such central locations in the city and cases of denominations crossing the aisle while their churches were being constructed to give them a place to worship and congregate in the meantime such as with the First Baptist Church which shared congregation space with the First Methodist in 1893 as their church was being built. Ultimately it shows that even if that had subtle differences in their interpretations or perspectives on their faith, they all had the same goals in who they were serving – their community, the Lord, and continuing to build and maintain their relationship with Christ and the Lord at the end of the day.[27]

The decision by these early settlers to establish houses of worship near the civic center underscored the role of faith communities as central pillars in the formation of the city. Each denomination "planted" its roots—both symbolically and physically—around Central Avenue, creating a religious and architectural landscape that led directly to the city's lasting nickname: the "City of Churches."
Today, that tradition continues, with dozens of active congregations across the city and new faith communities still being established, reflecting the ongoing importance of religious life in St. Petersburg's civic identity. Perhaps the largest growing church in the local Tampa Bay area which includes St. Petersburg, is Radiant Church, which was founded in 2013, it is a fast-growing, non-denominational church currently with 11 locations all across the bay area with a 12th location that was just announced. Radiant Church drew fewer than 200 guests in the early days, and it averaged nearly 8,000 members from their nine church locations at the time in 2024.[28]
In terms of this tradition continuing of churches being planted in this city, as recently as this year, NewSpring plans to plant Artisan City Church in St. Petersburg in 2025.[29]

St. Petersburg was incorporated as a city in June 1903.[14] With this transition, the development of the downtown waterfront had dredging of a deeper shipping channel from 1906 to 1908 which opened St. Petersburg to larger shipping. Further dredging improved the port facilities through the 1910s.[30] By then the city's population had quadrupled to a population of 4,127 citizens.[31] F. A. Davis was instrumental to bringing the first trolley service in 1904.[25]


In 1914, Al Lang invited the St. Louis Browns to move their spring training into the city, then worked tirelessly to make Grapefruit League training in and around St. Petersburg the destination for baseball teams and their fans by the 1920s. Lang eventually became mayor and ambassador for the city, and helped its permanent population grow tenfold in just a decade.[32]
In 1914 an airplane service across Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa and back was initiated, generally considered the first scheduled commercial airline flight. The flight took former mayor Abe Pheil to Tampa.[33] The company name was the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, and the pilot was Tony Jannus flying a Benoist XIV flying boat.[34] The Tony Jannus Award is presented annually for outstanding achievement in the airline industry.[35]

St. Petersburg's first library opened on December 1, 1915, which still operates to this day as the Mirror Lake Library.[14][36]

The city and its tourism industry burgeoned in the 1920s, with up to a quarter million visitors annually coming from Canada, the North and the Midwest by automobile, yacht, and railroad. The city was the principal Gulf Coast destination for long-distance trains of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad's Southland (from Chicago and Cincinnati) and Gulf Coast Limited[37] (from New York, succeeded by the West Coast Champion), and Seaboard Air Line Railroad trains such as the Southern States Special[38] (from New York, succeeded by the Silver Meteor). Travel time from across the bay was cut due to the Gandy Bridge's opening in 1924, allowing direct access to Tampa and the rest of central Florida.

The city took on a Mediterranean flair, with Old Spanish Trail style architecture promoted by Snell Isle founder Perry Snell, whose new country club island homes adopted many elements of Moorish design. Those same elements[14] were echoed in the city's new Vinoy, Jungle Country Club, Don Cesar and other fine hotels, as well as in Snell's new skyscraper office building downtown.[39] The 1926 opening of the Million Dollar Pier marked the peak of the boom, adding an attraction that brought both tourists and townspeople together to enjoy fishing, amusements, trolley access and even a local radio station.[40]

The St. Petersburg flag was created in 1927 and was designed by Mayor C.J. Maurer along with a committee of other public officials. It featured an array of colors symbolic of St. Pete's culture including the sunshine, water and land. The idea came after officials called for a new logo which later became the design for the flag. The pelican featured in the center became a symbol for the "Feed the Pelican Fund" which has supported the birds during the winter months.[41]

Tourism declined by the late 1920s and early 1930s due to the Great Depression. The city recovered later in the 1930s with the help of the Public Works Administration, including a $10 million investment plan in 1939 which helped build the St. Petersburg City Hall.[14]

St. Petersburg was a bit challenged as a city or rather had to make adaptations because it was mainly a tourist economy, and with the coming of World War II, that economy collapsed at first. It was only a few months after Pearl Harbor when the city's hotels and boardinghouses were barren. To quote historian Raymond Arsenault who experienced it firsthand, "Few cities felt the winds of war as early as St. Petersburg, and even fewer underwent such a thoroughgoing militarization."
The local leaders paused and thought about what they could do to adapt to the situation at hand, for what could be done with the city's many hotels and the perks that came with? Then there was a lightbulb moment by someone to use St. Petersburg's extensive supply of hotels, cafeterias, recreational facilities and other amenities to generously give it to our armed services as a training site. Then an aggressive campaign led by the city's chamber of commerce, city officials and Congressman J. Harden Peterson convinced Washington that the ball was in their court.
The War Department responded and selected St. Petersburg as a major technical services training center for the U.S. Army Air Corps. The city's Bayboro Harbor became a training base, The Vinoy Park Hotel was used as the headquarters, and every major hotel in the city was leased to the U.S. Air Corps except the Suwannee - for what little business remained for them was kept, and dozens of smaller hotels were leased as well. In addition to the army air corps, the Coast Guard, and the United States Maritime Service were trained in St. Petersburg also. By the time the training center was discontinued in July 1943, an estimated 120,000 troops had seen St. Petersburg as trainees and instructors.[42][43][44]
After the war, many of those troops who were stationed in St. Petersburg returned as residents or tourists.[14]

In the 1950s, St. Petersburg experienced another population boom, with the return of retiree resettlement to the city. In 1954 the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened its first span to link St. Petersburg with Manatee County, connecting the next year to U.S. Route 19 in the city. With a large influx of car traffic, it was decided to remove the city's streetcar lines.[45][46]

The development of major transportation continued into the 1960s with the completion of the Howard Frankland Bridge in 1960, creating another connection between St. Petersburg and Tampa.[46] St. Petersburg also received its first stadium named the Bayfront Center which hosted the first professional hockey league in Tampa Bay.[47][48] A new municipal marina and the Museum of Fine Arts were also built downtown.[14] St. Petersburg is home to one of the world's largest reclaimed water systems that was built in the 1970s which flows 37 million gallons of water per day to provide for customers located throughout the city.[49][50]

In 1984, a full-scale flying replica of the Benoist XIV flying boat was constructed by Florida Aviation Historical Society for the 70th anniversary of the flight. This aircraft is now on loan to the St. Petersburg Museum of History in St. Petersburg, Florida.[51][52]

In 1887, only a few dirt paths led to St. Petersburg, on which African Americans made their way to St. Petersburg. Many gained employment building railways, and settled in an area known as Pepper Town, where residents grew pepper. The neighborhood existed into the 1960s, and became the first of several black neighborhoods to maintain Jim Crow laws and government regulations that drew boundaries around said African American neighborhoods.[56] The first African American church was built in 1894. More African American neighborhoods, including Little Egypt, Sugar Hill, and Lincoln Court, were established around the Gas Plant, which developed its own business district.  A hospital for African Americans was established in 1923.[56] Segregation continued in these areas until the 1950s, when black leaders such as Robert Swain advocated for civil rights in St. Petersburg, and obtained building permits after threatening to sue the city for violating his civil rights.[56]

In 1880, the city was 53% white people to 47% black people.[57] The city publicly boasted the Klu Klux Klan klaverns' role in violence, and that they were "always on hand to help intimidate."[56] Law enforcement would enforce racially based curfews.[56] By the 1920s, St. Petersburg neighborhoods were segregated. In 1914, white residents lynched a black man suspected of murder and rape, and in 1905, after a black man knifed to death the city's police chief, a mob stormed the jail and "shot him to pieces."[56] In 1014, John Evans was accused of beating and raping a white woman, and a crowd of 1,500 white residents dragged him from his jail cell and lynched him.[56]

In 1944, the Army Service Forces feared race riots, and identified the location of black-owned newspapers and radio stations. Emergency orders were broadcast saying: "All liquor stores, bars, dance halls, moving picture theaters and public places, where people may congregate have been ordered closed. The streets have been ordered cleared...The congregation of more than three persons at any place is prohibited."[58]

From 1955 to 1959, black residents organized swim-ins of the segregated beaches and pools. The St. Petersburg government responded by closing these venues and arresting participants. This continued up to and after the 1957 Alsup v. St. Petersburg ruling that St. Petersburg could not segregate beaches or pools. In 1959, after continued pressure from residents through swim-in's, the government reopened them as an integrated venues.[54] In 1968, the city's mostly-black sanitation workers went on strike for higher wages.[59] Integration began in the 1960s, which included restaurants serving black people, integrated washrooms, and blacks hired as bus drivers (1964) and police officers.[56]

Development of the first Major League Baseball team to be located in the Tampa Bay area began in St. Petersburg throughout the 1970s. The city tried to encourage numerous teams through the United States to make St. Petersburg their new home.[14] Designs for a ballpark were first presented in 1983 and construction for a permanent dome stadium began in 1986.[60] This process controversially required the demolition of the mostly-Black Gas Plant neighborhood. The stadium opened in 1990 as the Florida Suncoast Dome, renamed the Thunderdome in 1993. After many attempts to attract tenants to the new stadium, Major League Baseball gave St. Petersburg a franchise in 1995. In 1996, the dome was renamed a third time to Tropicana Field after naming rights were established with Tropicana Dole Beverages.[61] The Tampa Bay Devil Rays was then established in 1998 after the stadium's renovation and the new team played their first game on March 31, 1998, giving the Tampa Bay area their first professional baseball team.[62]

I-275 was expanded across the bay from Tampa through St. Petersburg in the 1970s. Additional spurs I-175 and I-375 were built afterward, extending from the main highway to the northern and southern edges of the downtown area. The city population continued to multiply during the 20th century, booming through the 1970s as a retirement destination for Americans from midwestern cities, reaching 238,647 in the 1980 census. Racial tensions persisted, and t1996 riots were sparked by the shooting of a black teenager by a white St. Pete police officer. Growth stagnated in the subsequent decade and a half, but since the Great Recession, renewed interest in urban living by family-aged residents and the expansion of the downtown university and related services has led to growth.[citation needed]

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 137.6 square miles (356.4 km2). 61.7 square miles (159.9 km2) of it is land, and 75.9 square miles (196.5 km2) of it (55.13%) is water.[63] St. Petersburg is bordered by Tampa Bay's three sections, Old, Middle and Lower Tampa Bay.[64][65]

St. Petersburg is home to more than 100 neighborhoods,[66] with most of the historic districts located near the bay.[67] On the central Eastern edge of the city is Downtown St. Petersburg, which includes the city's residential and commercial skyscrapers, art galleries, museums, and parks.[68]

The downtown area is home to the central business district and to many start-up companies, corporate branches, banks, law firms, and restaurants.[69][70] Apart from downtown's business and cultural offerings, the area also includes a branch of St. Petersburg College and the campus of the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg.[68] The downtown district is home to two professional sports teams, the Tampa Bay Rays, which play in the western part of downtown at Tropicana Field, and the Tampa Bay Rowdies, which play along the downtown waterfront at Al Lang Stadium.[68] The emerging Edge district on the western edge of downtown is rapidly growing as development spreads down Central Avenue.

North of downtown lie the Historic Old Northeast and Snell Isle, which both have Mediterranean style historic and waterfront homes, parks, and recreational areas.[71][72] Old Northeast is home to a shopping district, city landmarks, beaches, and small shops as well as small residential high rises.[71] Snell Isle was founded by C. Perry Snell who bought up the land to develop upscale properties in the 1900s, and helped create some of St. Petersburg's resorts such as the Vinoy Park Hotel and the St. Petersburg Woman's Club,[73] both of which are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[74] The far north consists of the Gateway area which overlaps part of Pinellas Park, home to major employers such as Home Shopping Network and currently the site of much construction of residential and business buildings and of new toll roads.

The central portion of St. Petersburg includes the Grand Central District and Historic Kenwood. The Grand Central District houses many of the city's cafes, art galleries, restaurants, and bars all owing to the Craftsman style architecture.[75][76] Historic Kenwood is filled with art studios and galleries similarly to the Grand Central District.[77]

South of downtown is Historic Roser Park, which houses historic Mediterranean and Eclectic style housing, parks, and museums.[78] The neighborhood is divided by Booker Creek which flows into Bayboro Harbor.[79][80]

In far western St. Petersburg, north of the separate city of South Pasadena, Florida, is the neighborhood of Pasadena, which includes the intersection of State Road 693 (Pasadena Avenue) and County Road 150 (Central Avenue).

Downtown St. Petersburg is the Central Business District, containing high rises for office and residential use. The Tampa Bay Times newspaper is headquartered in the downtown area.[81][82] The Poynter Institute, which owns the paper, is located on 3rd Street South.[83]

The Mahaffey Theater complex, the Morean Arts Center, dozens of other art galleries, The Coliseum, Palladium Theatre, and Jannus Live are among the galleries and cultural venues featured downtown.[84] Several prominent museums are located in the perimeter. Many of them have received notable accolades, including the Chihuly Collection presented by the Morean Arts Center, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Salvador Dalí Museum, the now-closed Florida International Museum, the St. Petersburg Museum of History, Florida Holocaust Museum, and the James Museum of Western and Wildlife Art.[84] The city hosts many outdoor festivals throughout the year.[85]

Jutting a half mile into the bay is the St. Petersburg Pier, a major tourist attraction that offers various activities. "The Lens" design which was chosen by the International Design Competition Jury and accepted by City Council later had its contract terminated by a citywide election during the summer of 2013.[86][87] Following this, the "Pier Park" was chosen out of the 16 new design teams that submitted work in late 2014 and in 2015 the Pier Park was set for construction in early 2017.[40] The new Pier District opened on July 6, 2020, and contains green space, the Marketplace, playground, splash pad, and several public art installations, including Janet Echelman's aerial net sculpture, Bending Arc.[88]

Downtown also contains the University of South Florida St. Petersburg and a downtown branch of St. Petersburg College.[89][90] The downtown perimeter includes several parks, most of which are waterfront or lakefront. Straub Park is nearly a half mile long, boasts a waterfront location, and is home of the St. Petersburg Museum of Fine Arts.[91] Because of the number of parks in the downtown area, The Trust for Public Land ranks St. Petersburg 1st in Florida and 15th out of 100 of the largest cities in the U.S.[92] The Vinoy Park Hotel has a bayfront location, a spot on the National Register of Historic Places,[93] and an AAA Four-Diamond rating.[94] It fronts Vinoy Park, which holds music festivals, including the Warped Tour. Nearby is the historic Tramor Cafeteria building, now part of the Tampa Bay Times. The city is connected via the Looper Trolley.[95]

Many dining and nightlife locations can be found downtown on or near Central Avenue extending to 34th Street in the west or Beach Drive along the waterfront. Venues include Jannus Live and the State Theatre. The active nightlife scene is credited to recent demographic and regulatory changes.[96][97] In 2010, the city council voted to extend bar hours until 3 A.M., identical to cross-bay "rival" Tampa.[98][99]

Tropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays, is located in the western part of downtown. Until 2008, the team played its spring training games at nearby Progress Energy Park. This setup was unique, making St. Petersburg the first city that played host to its baseball team during spring training as well as the regular season since the 1919 Philadelphia Athletics.[100] At the end of 2007, there was a debate over a new stadium to be built on the downtown waterfront at the current Progress Energy Park site. Tropicana Field would be demolished and replaced with prime residential and retail space. Completion of the stadium was planned for 2012; however, the proposal was tabled indefinitely while a community-based organization investigates all alternatives for new stadium construction.[101][102][103] In 2022, the Rays organization and the city came to an agreement over redevelopment; the Trop will be demolished by 2027, to be replaced by a new stadium and a restored Gas Plant neighborhood surrounding it.[104] Although originally set to expire in 2027, the Rays use agreement for Tropicana Field was extended until 2028 due to the damage caused by Hurricane Milton in 2024 and will continue to be extended every year the field remains unplayable.[105] Previous plans to move forward with the construction of a new stadium in St. Petersburg's Historic Gas Plant District have since been scrapped, with the Rays stepping away from the deal.[105] The repairs to Tropicana field have been estimated to cost upwards of $55 million and the city aims to have them completed in time for the 2026 season.[106]

St. Petersburg has the third-largest dedicated public waterfront park system in North America,[107] with a waterfront park system that stretches 7 miles (11 km) and is used year-round for public events, festivals and other activities.[108] In the early 20th century, citizens and city leaders engaged in a long and boisterous debate over the future of the young city's waterfront space, with one side advocating for commercial, port and industrial development and the other side advocating for a long-term commitment to parks and public access to the waterfront. It was during the earliest days of the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce in 1908, that their committee at the time, investigated and reported that "The piers, all sorts of riff-raff, and especially where the outgoing tide leaves large stretches of sand covered with a variety of animal and vegetable matter in all stages of decay - does not well comport with a live, progressive city such as St. Petersburg aspires and claims to be." One of the chamber of commerce's many purposes is to serve as a collective voice for its local business members - with the overarching goal of helping them thrive, and one of the biggest roles the chamber has is promoting tourism too, which ultimately brings their city's business more visitors and money to the economy. For those reasons, when the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce heard that the waterfront could have a stigma attached to it - that was bad news to be hearing, for it meant it could be negatively impacting the city surrounding it. The committee urged the board of the chamber to take action by convincing the city officials to follow their plan that would lead them to plead into striking a deal with those who owned the waterfront lots at the time, and to acquire whatever remained of other necessary, relevant properties. The public access and park contingent won the debate when, on Christmas Eve 1909, the city announced the acquisition of the waterfront land that is encompassed by the waterfront park system.[109][27]
From the beginning of the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce's inception until even today, the chamber has made it clear the importance of the public access, upkeep, maintenance, expansion plans, and passion for their city's waterfront. Today the chamber has a Downtown Waterfront Committee, which has quarterly meetings involving public and private entities. Anyone can RSVP to be a part of this committee, and recommendations made during these meetings often go to the chambers board of directors meetings.[110][111]

The city is also becoming one of the largest destinations in Florida for kiteboarding with locations such as Fort De Soto Park, Pass-a-Grille, and Ten-Cent.[112]

The St. Petersburg Shuffleboard Club was established in 1924 and gained attention as the "World's Largest Shuffleboard Club" with 110 courts and over 5,000 members in the 1950s and 1960s.[113]

Northshore Aquatic Complex is a public pool and small water park located downtown on the St. Petersburg waterfront. Northshore contains a 50-meter pool with diving board, 25 meter training pool with zero depth entry, a play pool, and is home to both Saint Petersburg Aquatics swim club and Saint Petersburg Masters swim club.[114]

St. Petersburg has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) with some characteristics of a tropical monsoon climate (Am), with a defined rainy season from June through September. Many portions of St. Petersburg, especially along the bay and in south St. Petersburg, have tropical microclimates due to the maritime influence of the Gulf of Mexico and Tampa Bay.[citation needed] As a result, tropical flora like coconut palms and royal palms can be found throughout the city, and the city is home to the Gizella Kopsick Palm Arboretum, a 2-acre (0.81 ha) park which houses over 500 palms and cycads,[115] including a pair of large Jamaican Tall coconut palms which predate the freeze of 1989. St. Petersburg, like the rest of the Tampa Bay area, is occasionally affected by tropical storms and hurricanes. There were 2 hurricanes in 2024 that impacted St. Petersburg within 2 weeks of each other: Hurricane Helene followed by Hurricane Milton. However, both made landfall in other regions of the state (the Big Bend and Southwest Florida, respectively). The last time a hurricane directly struck the city was in 1921.

The city adopted an Integrated Sustainability Action Plan in 2019,[118] designed to help the city adopt sustainable practices.[119]

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 258,308 people, 111,957 households, and 59,448 families residing in the city.[125]

As of the 2010 United States census, there were 244,769 people, 106,755 households, and 58,353 families residing in the city.[126]

As for the history of the roads of St. Petersburg, the total and complete failure of Hillsborough County to build roads on the peninsula was one of the main reasons why Pinellas County was formed. Through Pinellas County, a system of marl roads was built throughout the county, giving good service for a while until the rain gave trouble with the marl surface. A demand was then made for brick roads, which was met with opposition for the price of bricks was much more expensive, the election was eventually passed a new network of nine-foot brick roads was completed by November 15, 1916. It had only been a few years after that, and it was apparent that there was a mistake with the fact that 9 foot roads were not wide enough to handle the heavy traffic, which was at the time two cars to pass each other - which was essential. There was another issue that the shoulders could not be maintained in good condition either, probably due to the fact that drivers had to constantly use them due to the road not being wide enough to begin with. It took years later for the election to finally be called and passed to create wider and better roads on a bond issue of $2,597,000.[27]

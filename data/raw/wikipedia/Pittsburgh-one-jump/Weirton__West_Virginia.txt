Weirton (/ˈwɪərtən/ WEER-tən) is a city in Hancock and Brooke counties in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It is located along the Ohio River in the state's northern panhandle bordering Ohio and Pennsylvania. The population was 19,163 at the 2020 census, making it the seventh-most populous city in West Virginia.[3]

Weirton was established in 1947 after the consolidation of various small towns in the vicinity of the Weirton Steel Corporation, founded by Ernest T. Weir in 1909. It is a principal city of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area, which had a population of 116,903 residents in 2020; it is also a major city in the western part of the Pittsburgh–New Castle–Weirton combined statistical area.

Holliday's Cove Fort was a Revolutionary War fortification constructed in 1774 by soldiers from Fort Pitt. It was located in what is now downtown Weirton, along Harmons Creek (named for Harmon Greathouse), about three miles from its mouth on the Ohio River. It was commanded by Colonel Andrew Van Swearingen (1741–1793) and later by his son-in-law, Captain Samuel Brady (1756–1795), the famous leader of Brady's Rangers. In 1779, over 28 militia were garrisoned at Hollidays Cove. Two years earlier, Colonel Van Swearingen led a dozen soldiers by longboat down the Ohio to help rescue the inhabitants of Ft. Henry in Wheeling in a siege by the British and Indian tribes in 1777. That mission was memorialized in a WPA-era mural painted on the wall of the Cove Post Office by Charles S. Chapman (1879–1962). The mural features Col. John Bilderback, who later gained infamy as the leader of the massacre of the Moravian Indians in Gnadenhutten in 1782.[7]

A small village called Holliday's Cove — which is now most of downtown Weirton — was founded on the site in 1793. In 1909, Ernest T. Weir arrived from neighboring Pittsburgh and built a steel mill, later known as the Weirton Steel Corporation, just north of Holliday's Cove.[8] An unincorporated settlement called Weirton grew up around the mill that, by 1940, was said to be the largest unincorporated city in the United States. By then Hollidays Cove and two other outlying areas, Weirton Heights, and Marland Heights, which as their names suggest were on hilltops or ridges surrounding the "Weir–Cove" area, had also incorporated.

On July 1, 1947, all of these areas — Hollidays Cove, Marland Heights, Weirton Heights, and unincorporated Weirton — merged and formed the city of Weirton as it currently exists. Thomas E. Millsop, the head of the Weirton Steel division of the other Ernest T. Weir company, National Steel Corporation, was elected as the city's first mayor. The city charter was approved by voters in 1950.

The Weirton Steel Corporation was once a fully integrated steel mill employing over 12,000 people. At one point was the largest private employer and the largest taxpayer in West Virginia. Due to reorganization of the steel industry, not only within the United States but worldwide, the Weirton mill faced declines in production. During the early 1980s the employees of Weirton Steel endeavored to purchase the mill from National Steel Corporation as the largest Employee Stock Ownership Program in the nation, saving the mill from bankruptcy.[9] However, by 2003 the corporation was forced to file bankruptcy after generating more than $700 million in losses since 1998.[10] In 2004, International Steel Group acquired the 3,000-worker plant before merging with international giant ArcelorMittal. By 2016, only the tin-plating section of the mill, though still one of the country's largest tin-plate makers, was in operation with only 800 workers.[11] In 2020, Ohio-based Cleveland-Cliffs purchased the tin mill.[12] In February 2024, Cleveland-Cliffs announced permanent closure of the mill and layoff of its remaining 800 workers.[13]

In May 2023, Form Energy began construction at the Weirton mill site for a manufacturing facility producing iron-air batteries for electrical storage.[14]

Some civic leaders are attempting to attract businesses and homeowners from the neighboring Pittsburgh metropolitan area, marketing Weirton as a bedroom community, taking advantage of the close proximity to the Pittsburgh International Airport and Interstate 70.

Weirton is home to a number of sites on the National Register of Historic Places including: Johnston-Truax House, Marland Heights Park and Margaret Manson Weir Memorial Pool, People's Bank, Dr. George Rigas House, and the Peter Tarr Furnace Site.[15]

The city of Weirton is located at 40°25′08″N 80°35′22″W﻿ / ﻿40.41889°N 80.58944°W﻿ / 40.41889; -80.58944 (40.4189, −80.5894).[16] It extends from the Ohio border on the west to the Pennsylvania border on the east at a point where the northern extension of West Virginia is 5 miles (8.0 km) across. It is the only community in the United States to touch two different states on either side and its own state on the other two.

Weirton is across the Ohio River from Steubenville, Ohio, and approximately 35 miles (56 km) west of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along U.S. Route 22. Pittsburgh International Airport is less than 30 miles (48 km) away. With the opening of Pennsylvania Route 576 from US 22 to the airport in October 2006, the highway distance to the airport has decreased to about 20 miles (32 km).

While most of the city is in Hancock County, a small section of the city is in Brooke County.  [18]

Weirton has three borders, including the cities of Follansbee to the south and New Cumberland to the north and the Pennsylvania/Washington County township of Hanover to the east.  Weirton is also adjacent to Steubenville, Ohio and is directly accessible via the Veterans' Memorial Bridge (U.S. Route 22).

Weirton has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa), with warm summers and chilly to cold winters.

By 2011, the city and its two counties had attracted the attention of the New York Times which noted the town was dwindling in population. The article reported that Brooke County had just 71 live births for every 100 deaths and that Hancock County was in similar straits. This has led, the article claimed, to a reduction in civic institutions.[22]

Historically, Weirton's economy was dominated by the steel industry, with the biggest employer being Weirton Steel Corporation. Over the years as the steel industry declined, the local economy has become more diversified, with retail services and medical services recording the largest increases. Due to the area's proximity to Pittsburgh, there is also a growing number of workers who work in Pittsburgh and commute from Weirton.

Weirton Medical Center, part of the West Virginia University Health System, is a large 238-bed hospital that services patients from all over the region and is one of the city's largest employers today employing over 1,400 people.[24]

In December 2022, Form Energy announced it will build a plant to manufacture iron-air batteries for grid-scale electrical storage in Weirton.[25]

There have been three fatal shootings by police officers in the history of the Weirton department.[26]  The third, in 2016, was a case of suicide by cop.  The first officer on the scene recognized the situation, determined that the situation posed no immediate threat, and started talking to the distressed citizen, who was holding an unloaded gun and telling the officer to "Just shoot me".[26] An officer who arrived subsequently shot the man dead on his fourth attempt, less than 10 seconds after arriving on the scene.[26]

The police department fired the first officer for not killing the man first.[26]  The police chief said in sworn testimony that although he had fired the officer for not shooting the man soon enough, the department's policy prohibits officers from shooting people whom they believe do not pose a threat.[26]  Shortly after this admission that the officer was fired for correctly following the department policy on the legitimate use of force, the city settled a lawsuit for wrongful termination.[26]

Children in Weirton are served by the Hancock County School District [27] and the Brooke County School District.[28]  The current schools serving the city are:

Weirton was the subject of a photo essay, "Weir's Weirton," in the Life issue of September 13, 1937. The issue's front cover featured a portrait of Ernest Tener Weir.

Weirton has attracted the attention of Hollywood filmmakers and writers on several occasions:

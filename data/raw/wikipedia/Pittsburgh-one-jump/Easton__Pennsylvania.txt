Easton is a city in and the county seat of Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States.[3] The city's population was 28,127 as of the 2020 census. Easton is located at the confluence of the Lehigh River and the Delaware River. Easton straddles the Lehigh River on the western side of the Delaware River, which serves as the city's eastern geographic boundary with Phillipsburg, New Jersey.

Easton is the easternmost city in the Lehigh Valley, a region of 731 square miles (1,890 km2) that is Pennsylvania's third-largest and the nation's 68th-largest metropolitan region with 861,889 residents as of the U.S. 2020 census. Of the Valley's three major cities, Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton, Easton is the smallest with approximately one-fourth the population of Allentown, the Valley's largest city.

The greater Easton area includes the city of Easton, three townships (Forks, Palmer, and Williams), and three boroughs (Glendon, West Easton, and Wilson). Centre Square, the city's town square in its downtown neighborhood, is home to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, a memorial for Easton area veterans killed during the American Civil War. In the first half of the 20th century, Centre Square was referred to locally as the Circle.[4] The Peace Candle, a candle-like structure, is assembled and disassembled every year atop the Civil War monument for the Christmas season.[5]

Norfolk Southern Railway's Lehigh Line, formerly the main line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, runs through Easton on its way to Bethlehem and Allentown heading west across the Delaware River to Phillipsburg, New Jersey. Easton is located 14 miles (23 km) northeast of Allentown, 51 miles (82 km) north of Philadelphia, and 64 miles (103 km) west of New York City.

On August 22, 1751, Thomas Penn, the son of William Penn, the colony's founder and original proprietor married Juliana Fermor. On September 8, 1751, a letter was sent to Colonial Governor James Hamilton by Penn requesting that a new town on the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers be named Easton and that it be in a new county called Northampton.[6] In 1752, as requested, the city was named in honor of Lady Juliana's family estate, the Easton Neston. The county was named after the estate's location, which was in the south of Northamptonshire, England.[7]

The Lenape Native Americans originally referred to present-day Easton and its surrounding region as Lechauwitank, meaning "the Place at the Forks".[8]

The land that includes present-day Easton was obtained from the Lenape in the Walking Purchase in 1737. A plaque commemorating the transaction appears in Easton's town square.[9][10]

Thomas Penn set aside a 1,000-acre (4 km2) tract of land at the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers for the town's establishment, and the city was formally founded in 1752. The same year, Easton was selected as the county seat of Northampton County.[11][12]

During the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Easton was signed in Easton by the British colonial government then governing the Province of Pennsylvania and the Native American tribes, including the Shawnee and Lenape, from what was then called Ohio Country.

Easton and the broader Lehigh Valley region played an instrumental and supportive role during the American Revolution, which commenced in 1775. In recognition of the strong pro-revolutionary sentiment in the city and region, Easton was one of only three designated locations, along with Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey, where the Declaration of Independence was read aloud in public for the first time on July 8, 1776, at noon, four days following its unanimous passage by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia.[13] During the Declaration's reading in Easton, the Easton flag was flown, making it one of the first non-colonial flags to fly in the Thirteen Colonies.[14] The same flag was later used by a militia during the War of 1812 and currently serves as Easton's municipal flag.

Easton maintained hospital used in the treatment of injured Continental Army soldiers during the war.[15] On June 18, 1779, General John Sullivan led 2,500 Continental Army soldiers from Easton to engage Indian allies of the British Army on the frontier.[16]

Located at the confluence of the rapidly flowing Lehigh River and the deeper and wider Delaware River, Easton became a major commercial center during the canal and railroad periods of the 19th century and a transportation hub for the region's coal, iron, and steel industries. The Delaware Canal was built soon after the lower Lehigh Canal was opened in 1818 and became effective in delivering much-needed anthracite coal to the region's largest markets, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and New York City.

Seeing other ways of exploiting the new fuel source, other entrepreneurs quickly moved to connect across the Delaware River reaching into the New York City area to the east through the Morris Canal in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, so the town became a canal hub from which coal from Mauch Chunk reached the world. Early railroads were often built to parallel this transportation corridor.

Historians of angling believe that, in 1845, Samuel Phillipe, an Easton gunsmith, invented the six-strip split-cane bamboo fly rod, which is commemorated by a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission plaque near Easton's Center Square.[17]

By the late 1860s, the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (LH&S) and Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) were built to augment the bulk traffic through the canals and provide lucrative passenger travel services. The LVRR, known as the Black Diamond Line operated twice daily express passenger trains to and from New York City and Buffalo, New York via Easton. The Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), leased and operated the LH&S tracks from the 1870s until the Conrail consolidations absorbed both the Central Railroad of New Jersey and Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1966. Today, the Lehigh Valley Railroad's main line is the only major rail line that goes through Easton and is now known as the Lehigh Line; the Lehigh Line was bought by the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999.

In the mid-19th century, canal transportation was largely replaced by railroads, and Easton became a hub for five railroads, including the Jersey Central, Lehigh Valley Railroad, and others. Easton lost its prominence in passenger transportation with the rise of the automobile in the mid-20th century.[18]


Like the Pennsylvania Dutch region to the southwest, Easton was settled largely by Germans. The Pennsylvania Argus, a German language newspaper, was published in Easton until 1917. As part of their heritage, the Germans put up one of the continent's earliest Christmas trees in Easton; Daniel Foley's book states that, "Another diary reference unearthed recently makes mention of a tree set-up at Easton, Pennsylvania, in 1816."[19] A plaque in Scott Park along the Delaware River commemorates this event. The Pennsylvania guide, compiled by the Writers' Program of the Works Progress Administration in 1940, described the rich and cosmopolitan fabric of Easton's society in the first half of the 20th century:[20]
The city is a composite of a hurried commercial present and a sedate mercantile past, leavened by a carefree college atmosphere. Coeds, dressed according to the dictates of Hollywood, and college boys in sports clothes and near-white buckskin shoes worn without regard for time or season, rub elbows with frugal Pennsylvania Dutch. A familiar sight on market days is the trucks and wagons, loaded with farm produce, drawn up to the curb at the Circle [Centre Square]. Women, scrupulously clean in their calico house dresses, and men in overalls or 'Sunday best,' arrange makeshift counters on which to display their vegetables, meats, crocks of apple butter, and pastries.

On December 16, 1925, the nation's largest fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, was founded at Lafayette College in Easton.[21][22]

Easton is located at 40°41′18″N 75°12′59″W﻿ / ﻿40.68833°N 75.21639°W﻿ / 40.68833; -75.21639 (40.688248, −75.216458).[23]
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.7 square miles (12 km2), 4.3 square miles (11 km2) of which is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) (8.39%) of which is water, including Bushkill Creek and the Lehigh and Delaware rivers. It also includes an island, Getter's Island, which was the site of Pennsylvania's last public execution.

Easton is divided into four districts: Downtown (DD), College Hill (CH), South Side (SS), and West Ward (WW). A number of smaller additional parks and institutional districts also exist.

Downtown Easton lies at the confluence of the Lehigh River and Delaware River and is a low-lying area surrounded by hills to the north, west, and south. North of downtown is College Hill, home of Lafayette College. South Easton, divided by the Lehigh River from the rest of the city, was a separate borough until 1898; it was settled initially by Native Americans and later by canal workers, and home to several silk mills.[citation needed] Wilson, West Easton, and Glendon are directly adjacent to the city. Wilson partly aligns to the same north–south grid as Easton.

Easton's Historic Downtown District lies directly at the confluence of the north banks of the Lehigh River and west banks of the Delaware River. Downtown adjoins each of the three other districts to the north, west, and south. Downtown continues west to Sixth Street and north to US Route 22.

College Hill is located north of downtown, starting north of US Route 22. This neighborhood is home of Lafayette College, a liberal arts and engineering institution.

The South Side district lies south of the Lehigh River.

The West Ward district is located west of downtown and encompasses much of west side Easton between Sixth and Fifteenth Streets.

Under the Köppen climate classification, Easton falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used.  Summers are usually hot and very muggy, averaging in the mid-80s during the day, though the high humidity makes it feel much warmer.  Fall and spring months are typically mild, offering many days in the mid-60s, as well as stronger winds. Winters are usually very cold and produce about 30 inches of snow. The local hardiness zone is 6b.

Easton operates a mayor-on-council city government. Residents elect a city controller, six city councilpersons (three at large and three district), and a mayor who is chairman and a voting member of the city council. All these officials are elected to four-year terms.[27][28] The incumbent mayor, Democrat Salvatore J. Panto, Jr., was reelected to his fourth consecutive term in 2019; he previously served two terms as Easton mayor from 1984 to 1992.[29][30]

Easton is part of Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district, represented in the U.S. House of Representatives currently by Republican Ryan Mackenzie, who was first elected to the office in 2024.

As of the 2010 census, the city was 67.2% White, 16.8% Black or African American, 0.4% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian, and 4.9% were two or more races. 19.9% of the population were of Latino ancestry.[34] As of the 2000 census,[35] there were 26,263 people, 9,544 households, and 5,735 families residing in the city.

Latino or Latino of any race were 9.79% of the population. The increase in Latinos—from less than 10% of the population in the 2000 census, to nearly 20% in the 2010 census, is a significant change in the city's demographics. The growth in Latino residents is similar to increases in Allentown and Bethlehem, the Valley's two largest cities.

The school district has seven elementary schools: Cheston, Forks, March, Palmer, Paxinosa, Shawnee, and Tracy for grades K-5, Easton Area Middle School Campus (in Forks Township) for grades 6–8, and Easton Area High School (in Easton) for grades 9–12. Total student enrollment in the school district is approximately 8,289 students in all grades as of 2020–21.

Easton Area High School is known[36] for its long-standing athletic rivalry with Phillipsburg High School in neighboring Phillipsburg, New Jersey. The two teams play an annual football game on Thanksgiving Day that is considered one of the largest and longest-standing rivalries in American high school football. In 2006, the rivalry marked its 100th anniversary.[36] The game, which was broadcast on ESPN, was won by Easton. In 2009, Easton was the location of the Gatorade REPLAY Game in which the 1993 teams from the Easton vs. Phillipsburg game met again following their 7–7 tie in 1993. The REPLAY Game was won by Phillipsburg, 27–12.[37]

Easton Area High School competes in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, which includes the 12 largest high schools in the Lehigh Valley and Poconos and is one of the nation's most elite high school athletic conferences. Easton holds the third most conference championships in all sports, behind only Parkland High School and Emmaus High School.[38] Easton is also home to Notre Dame High School, a Catholic school.

Easton is the home of one four-year college, Lafayette College, which was established in 1826. Lafayette is located in Easton's College Hill section and is home to 2,514 undergraduate students as of the 2022–2023 academic year.[39] In 2017, U.S. News & World Report ranked Lafayette as the nation's 36th best liberal arts college.[39]

Prior to the American Civil War, Easton was also home to Union Law School, which was founded in 1846 but struggled soon after the death of its founder, Judge Washington McCartney, a decade later, in 1856. While at least two students, future U.S. Representative Philip Johnson and Wisconsin state senator Robert L. D. Potter, attended the school, a historian in 2000 described Union Law School as not being able to sustain itself after McCartney's death, writing that the school was "a one-man operation that died with him."[40]

Easton has a long history of involvement with arts and culture, encompassing both the promotion of artistic and cultural events and serving as the home or birthplace of many notable artists. The city is home to the State Theatre Center for the Arts, a restored 1920s vaudeville and movie palace[41] that now hosts concerts, theatrical productions, and exhibitions. It is also home to the Sigal Museum, a history museum that grew out of the Northampton County Historical and Genealogical Society[42]. Alongside long-standing institutions such as the Arts Community of Easton (ACE)[43] and the Karl Stirner Arts Trail[44], a range of smaller galleries and community organizations[45] contribute to the city's cultural life. Local and visiting artists regularly present work in Easton, and the city has become a subject of artistic interpretation in photography, painting, and literature.

The city and surrounding area have produced notable musicians such as guitarist Greg Howe[46] and jazz pianist Mulgrew Miller[47], as well as dancers like Jennie Somogyi, who trained in classical ballet and, after an injury, opened a ballet school in Easton[48]. Easton's visual arts scene includes historical artists such as fraktur artist Johannes Ernst Spangenberg, known as the Easton Bible Artist[49], painters such as Frederick Knecht Detwiller[50], and documentary photographer Ed Eckstein[51]. Photographer Peter Ydeen created a comprehensive photographic documentation of Easton at night, capturing its streets and urban landscapes in his series Easton Nights[52]. Karl Stirner, the namesake of the Karl Stirner Arts Trail, maintained a large Ferry Street warehouse that served as both a studio and the center of artist engagement in Easton[53].

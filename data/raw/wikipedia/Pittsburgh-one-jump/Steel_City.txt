The Steel City is a common nickname for many cities that were once known for their production of large amounts of steel.  With industrial production also in developing countries, like those in Eastern Europe and Asia, most of these cities do not produce as much steel as they used to.  It is possible there will be new steel cities in those developing countries.

Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Sheffield, United Kingdom; Birmingham, Alabama, United States; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; Gary, Indiana, United States; Lorain, Ohio, United States; Pueblo, Colorado, United States; Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia; Hamilton, Ontario, Canada; Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada; Rourkela, Bokaro Steel City and Bhilai, India, are some of the cities most commonly referred to with this name, in their respective countries.

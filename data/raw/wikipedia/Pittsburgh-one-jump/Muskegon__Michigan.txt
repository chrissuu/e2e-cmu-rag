Muskegon (/məˈskiːɡən/ mə-SKEE-gən) is a city in and the county seat of Muskegon County, Michigan, United States.[7] Situated around a harbor of Lake Michigan, Muskegon is known for fishing, sailing regattas, and boating. It is the most populous city along Lake Michigan's eastern shore. At the 2020 census, the city's population was 38,318.[4] The city is administratively autonomous from adjacent Muskegon Township, and several locations in Muskegon Township and other surrounding townships have Muskegon addresses.

Muskegon is the center of the Muskegon metropolitan statistical area, which is coextensive with Muskegon County and had a population of 175,824 as of the 2020 census.[3] It is also part of the larger Grand Rapids-Kentwood-Muskegon-combined statistical area.[8]

The name "Muskegon" is derived from the Ottawa mashkiigong, meaning "marshy river or swamp".[9][10]

The "Masquigon" River (Muskegon River) was identified on French maps dating from the late 17th century, suggesting French explorers had reached Michigan's western coast by that time. Father Jacques Marquette traveled northward through the area on his fateful trip to St. Ignace in 1675, and a party of French soldiers under La Salle's lieutenant, Henry de Tonty, passed through the area in 1679.[11]

The county's earliest known Euro-American resident was Edward Fitzgerald, a fur trader and trapper who came to the Muskegon area in 1748 and who died there, reportedly being buried in the vicinity of White Lake. Between 1790 and 1800, a French-Canadian trader named Joseph La Framboise established a fur-trading post at the mouth of Duck Lake. Between 1810 and 1820, several French-Canadian fur traders, including Lamar Andie, Jean Baptiste Recollect, and Pierre Constant, had established fur-trading posts around Muskegon Lake.[11]

Euro-American settlement of Muskegon began in earnest in 1837, which coincided with the beginning of the exploitation of the area's extensive timber resources. The explosion of the lumber industry in 1837 inaugurated what some regard as the most romantic era in the history of the region. Lumbering in the mid-19th century brought many settlers, particularly from Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden.[12]

Some Muskegon neighborhoods began as separate villages. Bluffton was founded as a lumbering village in 1862 in Laketon Township. It had its own post office from 1868 until 1892. Muskegon annexed it in 1889.[13]

Muskegon is in western Muskegon County, on the south side of Muskegon Lake, a harbor of Lake Michigan. The city is bordered to the north, across Muskegon Lake, by the city of North Muskegon and Laketon Township. It is bordered to the east by Muskegon Township, to the southeast by Fruitport Township, to the south by the cities of Muskegon Heights, Roosevelt Park, and Norton Shores, and to the west by Lake Michigan.

In May 2022, local environmental groups announced cleanup efforts along Muskegon Lake officially have been completed, leading the Environmental Protection Agency to begin its study to remove Muskegon Lake from the EPA's list of "Areas of Concern", which was expected to be finalized by the end of 2022 and promised additional new economic activity in the downtown and nearby lakefront neighborhoods.[14]

Muskegon has a humid continental climate (Dfa) with hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation is consistent year-round. Muskegon receives heavy lake-effect snow from Lake Michigan during winter.

The Michigan Shore Railway, provides freight rail service for many of Muskegon's industries. Rail passenger services ended in 1971 with the advent of Amtrak; the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad’s routes in Michigan were not included in the initial Amtrak system. The nearest passenger rail available is via Amtrak in nearby Holland or Grand Rapids. Until 1971, the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway (successor to the Pere Marquette Railway) operated day and night trains from Union Station to Holland and Chicago. The C&O became a unit of Chessie System in 1973 and subsequently CSX Transportation in 1987. CSX leased their Muskegon area lines to MS in 2005.[37] The Grand Trunk Western and the Pennsylvania Railroad had earlier operated passenger trains out of another Muskegon station to various points in Michigan.[38]

In 1937, the Grand Trunk Western began operating ferries that met up with train and carried passengers and automobiles across Lake Michigan to Milwaukee. Earlier, the GTW had operated the ferries out of Grand Haven. The GTW stopped operating the ferries in 1978. The last remaining ferries across the lake would be the ones launching from Ludington, Michigan[39][40] until the Lake Express first came into service on June 1, 2004.[41]

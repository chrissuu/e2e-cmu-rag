Millcreek Township is a township in Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 54,070 at the 2020 census,[3] making it the 14th-largest municipality in the state[4] and the largest township in Western Pennsylvania.

Millcreek Township is home to the entrance to Presque Isle State Park, Waldameer Park, Millcreek Mall, and other attractions. Also located in the township is Erie International Airport, the primary airport serving the Erie metropolitan area. LECOM Health, a non-profit healthcare system serving Erie County and the surrounding areas, also calls the township home.

Evidence exists of Native American presence in Millcreek Township as early as 3700 BC. The township's Sommerheim Park is the location of the Sommerheim Park Archaeological District, which has yielded archaeological artifacts from the Archaic and Woodland periods.[5]

Millcreek, one of the original 16 townships of Erie County, was among the first areas settled in the Erie Triangle. As new families arrived, they moved inland from the bayfront settlement of Erie. They established small hamlets such as Federal Hill, Kearsarge, Marvintown, and Weigelville—all of which later became part of Millcreek Township. As Erie expanded, first becoming a borough and then a city, it gradually annexed increasing portions of the township.

After surveyors laid out the east–west roads, tavern owners began establishing inns roughly every mile. In 1805, workers extended Ridge Road—now part of U.S. Route 20—westward through Millcreek, prompting a rise in such establishments. One tavern that still stands is the Nicholson Tavern, which Isabella Nicholson and her sons constructed in 1836. The Nicholson family continues to own the property, which appears on the National Register of Historic Places. Other Millcreek sites on the National Register include the Presque Isle Light and the Sommerheim Park Archaeological District.[6]

A recurving sandspit peninsula, Presque Isle, connects to the mainland in western Millcreek. During the War of 1812, Oliver Hazard Perry commanded his fleet in battle and strategically used the peninsula's bay as a harbor to construct six out of nine of the ships in his fleet. In 1921, the peninsula was designated a state park and later became a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. Today, the park serves as a bird sanctuary, home to over 150 different species.

Just west of the entry into Presque Isle was a well-forested area known as Hopkins Grove. The Erie Electric Motor Company purchased the grove in 1896 for development into an amusement park. Waldameer Park is one of the oldest amusement parks in the nation.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 32.8 square miles (84.9 km2), of which 32.1 square miles (83.1 km2) is land and 0.73 square miles (1.9 km2), or 2.20%, is water.[7]

Today, Millcreek dedicates its land to retail, commercial, and service-oriented businesses, as well as light industry, public and private schools, and residential neighborhoods. Only about 1% of the land remains zoned for agriculture. Within the township's borders, Edinboro University operates Porreco College, and the community maintains recreational spaces such as Zuck Park, the Erie Golf Course, and the Asbury Woods Nature Center and Recreation Center.

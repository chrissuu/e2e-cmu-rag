The Clemente Museum carries on the giving legacy of Roberto Clemente. The museum organized local relief efforts upon hearing of the devastation of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.[6] They asked the community to donate $21, in honor of Clemente's number, for relief.[7] The efforts raised over $50,000 and filled two 43-foot tractor-trailers with supplies.[8]

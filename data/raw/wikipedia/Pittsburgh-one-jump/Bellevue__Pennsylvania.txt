Bellevue is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 8,311 at the 2020 census.[3] A suburb of Pittsburgh, it is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

The borough was incorporated in 1867. There is a public park and library, the Andrew Bayne Memorial Library.

The land on which the borough now sits was once part of the Depreciation Lands reserved for Revolutionary War veterans.[4] The first landowners in the area were James Robinson and Hugh Henry Brackenridge, who purchased parcels in 1799 and 1792, respectively.[4]

Early settlers in what would become Bellevue included Samuel Dilworth, Andrew Jack, Zachariah Blackburn, and Erasmus Cooper. Jack operated a ferry, hotel, and mill, and was prominent in the community’s early development.[5] By the late 19th century, the borough was described as combining "healthfulness, accessibility, and beautiful natural scenery,"[5] and as offering suburban advantages for those working in nearby Pittsburgh. Methodist and Presbyterian congregations were established in the mid-19th century, with church buildings completed in the 1860s and 1870s.[5]

Residents of the area sought road and infrastructure improvements from Ross Township, but township officials opposed development along the Venango Trail (today Route 19).[4] In response, Bellevue incorporated as a borough independent of Ross on September 7, 1867.[6] The name “Bellevue” was chosen by J. J. East, a linguist and early resident, and means “beautiful view.”[4] At the time of its incorporation, Bellevue had exactly the minimum population then required for borough status: 300 residents.[7]

The community's post office, originally established under the name Robella, was renamed "Bellevue" on April 16, 1887.[5]

Bellevue was historically a dry town, prohibiting the sale of alcohol in stores and restaurants even before Prohibition. Alcohol sales remain regulated by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB).[8] A 2011 referendum to allow limited alcohol sales at certain establishments was defeated,[9] but a similar measure passed in 2015.[10]

Bellevue contains over 1,000 buildings over 100 years old. In 2016, to recognize 150 years since the borough's founding, Bellevue's Community Development Corporation (CDC), Bona Fide Bellevue, launched a historic building plaque program, consisting of inventorying all the buildings in Bellevue. Of over 2,600 buildings, just over 730 had been approved locally "historic." Over 150 property owners voluntarily elected to purchase a plaque signifying the historic nature of their buildings.

Three buildings have been further recognized as historic:

I am a bit confused about this template. What are these classes in reference to? Because from my understanding a first class city references different parts of the state code than first class townships (such as the First-Class Township Code vs Borough Code vs Third-Class City Code as listed on List of Pennsylvania municipalities and counties with home rule charters, optional charters, or optional plans). So if the numbered classes for cities and townships are different, shouldn't they be given distinct sections on this template? Or is there some similarity between first-class cities and townships and between second-class cities and townships that I am unaware of? 
If not I suggest we create tiered categories to separate cities and townships, while also renaming the N/A section to Boroughs. --Gimelthedog (talk) 20:03, 5 September 2020 (UTC)[reply]

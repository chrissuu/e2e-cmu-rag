The Steel City Yellow Jackets are a basketball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The team is a member of the American Basketball Association. They play their home games at A Giving Heart Community Center.

The Yellow Jackets began play on November 8, 2014 as an expansion team competing in the ABA's Northeast Division. The Yellow Jackets played all of their first season home games at the Community College of Allegheny County Allegheny Campus, which is located on Pittsburgh's North Shore, directly behind Heinz Field.

The Steel City Yellow Jackets were originally owned by national recording Hip hop artist Antjuan "Tjuan Benafactor" Washington and Averill 'Ace' Pippens, who also serves as the team's general manager and head coach.[1] Pippens, also known as "Coach Ace", was the assistant coach at Pittsburgh's David B. Oliver High School before becoming assistant, and eventually head coach, of the Penn State McKeesport men's basketball team. Pippens' led Penn State McKeesport to a championship title in 2006.

In 2022, the Yellow Jackets won their first ABA national championship by defeating Team Trouble 123-118.[2] After the game, Jackets' player Kenny Holmes was named the Most Valuable Player of the playoff tournament.

In August 2023, the team announced it would not participate in the 2023â€“24 ABA season after Averill Pippens was named head coach of Westinghouse High School.[3] Gilmore Cummings and other veteran players from the team attempted to play that season as the Pennsylvania Starz, but were thrown out of the ABA after infringing on the Yellow Jackets' territorial rights by staging a game within Pittsburgh city limits.[4]

The Yellow Jackets returned to play for the 2024-25 ABA season.[5] Although the team struggled to a 5-5 record, they defeated the Columbus Wizards 136-103 to win the ABA Central Blue Division and advance to the 2025 ABA playoffs. Steel City then lost a Region Semifinal matchup to the defending league champion Chicago Fury by a score of 100-86.

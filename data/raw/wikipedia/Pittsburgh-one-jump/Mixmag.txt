Mixmag is a British electronic dance and clubbing magazine published in London. Launched in 1983 as a print magazine, it has branched into dance events, including festivals and club nights.

The first issue of Mixmag was printed on 1 February 1983 as a 16-page black-and-white magazine published by Disco Mix Club, a DJ mailout service. The first cover featured American music group Shalamar.[1]

When house music began in the 1980s, editor and DJ Dave Seaman turned the magazine from a newsletter for DJs into a magazine covering all dance music and club culture.[2] Mixmag, in association with its original publishing company, DMC Publishing, released a series of CDs under the "Mixmag Live" heading. The magazine, which reached a circulation of up to 70,000 copies[citation needed], was later sold to EMAP Ltd. in the mid-1990s.

In 1996, an American version titled Mixmag USA was launched. It was renamed Mixer after the UK edition of Mixmag was sold to EMAP. It ceased publication altogether in 2003.[3][4][5][6]

After a fall in sales in 2003,[7] Mixmag was acquired by Development Hell, in 2005.[8] In 2007, Nick DeCosemo became editor.[8] Duncan Dick became editor in April 2015.[9] Patrick Hinton became editor in August 2022. [10]  In 2012, The Guardian collaborated with Mixmag on a survey of British drug-taking habits.[11]

The magazine ended its print edition in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as of 2025 is now online only.[12][13]

Mixmag is owned by Wasted Talent Ltd, a company which changed its name from Mixmag Media Ltd in May 2017.[14]

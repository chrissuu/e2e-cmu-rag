Fox Chapel is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is a suburb of Pittsburgh located 6 miles (10 km) northeast of downtown. The population was 5,343 as of the 2020 census.[3]

In the 1750s, the Seneca Indians lived in the region. Until the late 18th century, American Indian tribes hunted and fished in the general Fox Chapel area. Virginia and Pennsylvania both claimed the territory. The dispute was not resolved until after the Revolutionary War.[4] Today, less than 1% of its population is Native American.[5]

The first white settler in the area was James Powers, who arrived around 1790.[6] The first schoolhouse was on Squaw Run, where it stood in 1806. It was a log house. A church was organized in 1818 on Kittanning Road, on a branch of Pine Creek.[7] The Pittsburgh Field Club, which was established in 1882, moved to present-day Fox Chapel in 1915, and the Fox Chapel Golf Club opened in 1919. Shady Side Academy opened its senior school on property that was formerly two large farms, a gift from prominent Pittsburgh industrialist Wallace H. Rowe, in 1922. A nearby private estate, built in 1928 by steel industrialist James E. Lewis, became the academy's standalone middle school campus in 1958.[8]

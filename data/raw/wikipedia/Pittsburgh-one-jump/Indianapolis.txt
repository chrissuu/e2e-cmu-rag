Indianapolis (/ˌɪndiəˈnæpəlɪs/ ⓘ IN-dee-ə-NAP-ə-lis),[10][11] colloquially known as Indy, is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Indiana and the county seat of Marion County. Indianapolis is situated in the state's central till plain region along the west fork of the White River. The city's official slogan, "Crossroads of America", reflects its historic importance as a transportation hub and its relative proximity to other major North American markets.[12][13]

At the 2020 census, the balance population was 887,642.[14] Indianapolis is the 16th-most populous city in the U.S., the third-most populous city in the Midwest after Chicago and Columbus, Ohio, and the fourth-most populous state capital in the nation after Phoenix, Austin, and Columbus. The Indianapolis metropolitan area is the 33rd-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., home to 2.1 million residents.[15] With a population of more than 2.6 million, the combined statistical area ranks 28th.[16] Indianapolis proper covers 368 square miles (950 km2), making it the 18th-most extensive city by land area in the country.

Indigenous peoples inhabited the area dating to as early as 10,000 BC.[17] In 1818, the Lenape relinquished their tribal lands in the Treaty of St. Mary's.[18] In 1821, Indianapolis was established as a planned city for the new seat of Indiana's state government. The city was platted by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham on a 1-square-mile (2.6 km2) grid. Completion of the National and Michigan roads and later arrival of rail solidified the city's position as a major manufacturing and commercial center.[19] Since the 1970 city-county consolidation, known as Unigov, local government administration operates under the direction of an elected 25-member city-county council headed by the mayor.

Indianapolis anchors the 28th largest metropolitan economy in the U.S.[20] Prominent industries include trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; professional and business services; government; leisure and hospitality; and manufacturing.[21] The city has notable niche markets in amateur sports and auto racing.[22][23] Contemporary Indianapolis is home to two major league sports teams, three Fortune 500 companies, eight university campuses, and numerous cultural institutions, including the world's largest children's museum.[24][25] The city is perhaps best known for hosting the world's largest single-day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500.[26][27] Among the city's historic sites and districts, Indianapolis is home to the largest collection of monuments dedicated to veterans and war casualties in the U.S. outside of Washington, D.C.[28][29]

The name Indianapolis is derived from pairing the state's name, Indiana (meaning "Land of the Indians", or simply "Indian Land"[30]), with the suffix -polis, the Greek word for "city". Jeremiah Sullivan, justice of the Indiana Supreme Court, is credited with coining the name.[31] Other names considered were Concord, Delaware, Suwarrow, Tecumseh, Wayne, and Whetzel.[32][33]

In 1816, the year Indiana gained statehood, the U.S. Congress donated four sections of federal land to establish a permanent seat of state government.[34] Two years later, under the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818), the Delaware relinquished title to their tribal lands in central Indiana, agreeing to leave the area by 1821.[18] This tract of land, which was called the New Purchase, included the site selected for the new state capital in 1820.[35] The indigenous people of the land prior to systematic removal are the Miami Nation of Indiana (Miami Nation of Oklahoma) and Indianapolis makes up part of Cession 99; the primary treaty between the indigenous population and the United States was the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818).[36]

The availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American settlers were Protestants, a large proportion of the early Irish and German immigrants were Catholics. Few African Americans lived in central Indiana before 1840.[37]

The first European Americans to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe George Pogue and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later called Pogue's Run. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 that John Wesley McCormick and his family and employees became the area's first European American settlers, settling near the White River in February 1820.[38]

On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital.[39] The state legislature approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821.[1] In April, Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham were appointed to survey and design a town plan for the new settlement.[40] Indianapolis became a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, when Marion County, was established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832 when Indianapolis was incorporated as a town.[41]

Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847. Samuel Henderson, the city's first mayor, led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to be revised as Indianapolis expanded.[41] Effective January 1, 1825, the seat of state government moved to Indianapolis from Corydon, Indiana. In addition to state government offices, a U.S. district court was established at Indianapolis in 1825.[42]

Growth occurred with the opening of the National Road through the town in 1827, the first major federally funded highway in the United States.[43] A small segment of the ultimately failed Indiana Central Canal was opened in 1839.[44] The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, began operation in 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth.[45] Indianapolis Union Station was the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 1853.[46]

During the American Civil War, Indianapolis was mostly loyal to the Union cause. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a rallying place for Union army troops. On February 11, 1861, President-elect Lincoln arrived in the city, en route to Washington, D.C. for his presidential inauguration, marking the first visit from a president-elect in the city's history.[47] On April 16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis as a headquarters for the state's volunteer soldiers.[48][49] Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits signed up to fight for the Union.[50]

Indianapolis became a major logistics hub during the war, establishing the city as a crucial military base.[51][52] Between 1860 and 1870, the city's population more than doubled.[45] An estimated 4,000 men from Indianapolis served in 39 regiments, and an estimated 700 died during the war.[53] On May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic convention at Indianapolis, forcing an adjournment of the proceedings, sarcastically referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run.[54] Fear turned to panic in July 1863, during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but Confederate forces turned east toward Ohio, never reaching Indianapolis.[55] On April 30, 1865, Lincoln's funeral train made a stop at Indianapolis, where an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people passed the assassinated president's bier at the Indiana Statehouse.[52][56]

Following the Civil War and in the wake of the Second Industrial Revolution, Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity. In 1880, Indianapolis was the world's third-largest pork packing city, after Chicago and Cincinnati, and the second-largest railroad center in the U.S. by 1888.[57][58] By 1890, the city's population surpassed 100,000.[45] Some of the city's most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation, including L. S. Ayres (1872), Eli Lilly and Company (1876), Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company (1910), and Allison Transmission (1915).

Some of the city's most prominent architectural features and best-known historical events date from the turn of the 20th century. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, dedicated on May 15, 1902, would later become the city's unofficial symbol.[59] Ray Harroun won the inaugural running of the Indianapolis 500, held May 30, 1911, at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Indianapolis was one of the hardest hit cities in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in five known deaths[60][61][62] and the displacement of 7,000 families.[63]

Once home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile manufacturing.[64] The city was an early focus of labor organization.[45] The Indianapolis streetcar strike of 1913 and subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state's earliest labor-protection laws, including a minimum wage, regular work weeks, and improved working conditions.[65] The International Typographical Union and United Mine Workers of America were among several influential labor unions based in the city.[45]

As a stop on the Underground Railroad, Indianapolis had one of the largest black populations in the Northern States, until the Great Migration.[66] Led by D. C. Stephenson, the Indiana Klan became the most powerful political and social organization in Indianapolis from 1921 through 1928, controlling the City Council and the Board of School Commissioners, among others. At its height, more than 40% of native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan.

While campaigning in the city in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy delivered one of the most lauded speeches in 20th century American history, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.[67][68][69] As in most U.S. cities during the civil rights movement, the city experienced strained race relations, including 1969 riots. A 1971 federal court decision forcing Indianapolis Public Schools to implement desegregation busing proved controversial.[70]

During the mayoral administration of Richard Lugar (1968–1976), the city and county governments consolidated. Known as Unigov (a portmanteau of "unified" and "government"), the city-county consolidation removed bureaucratic redundancies, captured increasingly suburbanizing tax revenue, and created a Republican political machine that dominated local politics until the early 2000s.[71][72] Effective January 1, 1970, Unigov expanded the city's land area by more than 300 square miles (780 km2) and increased its population by some 250,000 people.[73] It was the first major city-county consolidation to occur in the U.S. without a referendum since the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898.[74] Lugar is credited with initiating downtown revitalization efforts, overseeing the building of Market Square Arena, renovations to Indianapolis City Market, and the formation of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis.[75]

Amid the changes in government and growth, the city pursued an aggressive economic development strategy to raise the city's stature as a sports tourism destination, known as the Indianapolis Project.[76] During the administration of the city's longest-serving mayor, William Hudnut (1976–1992), millions of dollars were invested into sports venues and public relations campaigns. The strategy was successful in landing the U.S. Olympic Festival in 1982, securing the relocation of the Baltimore Colts in 1984, and hosting the 1987 Pan American Games.[23]

Beginning in 1992, the mayoral administration of Stephen Goldsmith introduced a number of austerity measures to address budget shortfalls through privatization and greater reliance on public–private partnerships. Major downtown revitalization projects continued through the 1990s, including the openings of Circle Centre Mall, Victory Field, and Gainbridge Fieldhouse, as well as ongoing redevelopment of the Canal and White River State Park area.[77]

Bart Peterson took office in 2000, the first Democrat elected to the post since John J. Barton's 1963 election.[78] The Peterson administration focused on education reform and promoting the arts. In 2001, the mayor's office became the first in the U.S. to authorize charter schools. Indianapolis Cultural Districts were designated in 2003, followed by the groundbreaking of the Indianapolis Cultural Trail in 2007. Further consolidation of city and county units of government resulted in the establishment of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department in 2007. Later that year, Greg Ballard succeeded Peterson in a political upset.[79]

The Ballard administration oversaw the lease of the city's parking meters and the sale of the city's water and wastewater utilities with proceeds financing street repairs. Ballard pursued several environmental sustainability efforts, including establishing an office of sustainability, installing 200 miles (320 km) of bike lanes and trails, and spearheading a controversial deal to start an electric carsharing program.[80][81] Two of the city's largest capital projects, the Indianapolis International Airport's new terminal and Lucas Oil Stadium, were completed in 2008.[82][83] In 2012, construction began on a $2 billion tunnel system, a project known as DigIndy, which was designed to reduce sewage overflows into the city's waterways.[84]

Since 2016, the administration of Joe Hogsett has focused on addressing a rise in gun violence and the city's racial disparities. In recent years, significant capital and operational investments have been made in public safety, criminal justice, and public transit. The city also established rental assistance and food security programs. In 2020, the George Floyd protests in Indiana prompted a series of local police reforms and renewed efforts to bolster social services for mental health treatment and homelessness.[85][86] In 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a FedEx facility on the city's southwest side, killing nine (including the gunman) and injuring seven others.[87][88]

Indianapolis is located in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States, about 14 miles (23 km) south-southeast of Indiana's geographic center.[89] It is situated 98 miles (158 km) northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio, 107 miles (172 km) north of Louisville, Kentucky, 164 miles (264 km) southeast of Chicago, Illinois, and 168 miles (270 km) west of Columbus, Ohio.[90] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Indianapolis (balance) encompasses a total area of 367.9 square miles (953 km2), of which 361.6 square miles (937 km2) is land and 6.3 square miles (16 km2) is water.[3] It is the 18th-most extensive city by land area in the U.S.

As a consolidated city-county, Indianapolis's city limits are coterminous with Marion County, except the autonomous and semi-autonomous municipalities outlined in Unigov.[45][91] Nine civil townships form the broadest geographic divisions within the city and county; these are Center, Decatur, Franklin, Lawrence, Perry, Pike, Warren, Washington, and Wayne townships.[92] The consolidated city-county borders the adjacent counties of Boone to the northwest; Hamilton to the north; Hancock to the east; Shelby to the southeast; Johnson to the south; Morgan to the southwest; and Hendricks to the west.[93]

Between 2.6 million and 11,700 years ago, the Indianapolis area was situated on the southern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The erosive advance and retreat of glacial ice produced a flat or gently sloping landscape, known as a till plain. Elevations across Indianapolis vary from about 650 feet (198 m) to 900 feet (274 m) above mean sea level.[94] Indianapolis is located in the West Fork White River drainage basin, part of the larger Mississippi River watershed via the Wabash and Ohio rivers.[95] The White River flows 31 miles (50 km) north-to-south through the city and is fed by some 35 streams, including Eagle Creek, Fall Creek, Pleasant Run, and Pogue's Run.[96] The city's largest waterbodies are artificial quarry lakes and reservoirs.

Indianapolis is an example of a planned city. In 1821, the Indiana General Assembly selected a site near the confluence of the White River and Fall Creek to serve as the new state capital, adopting a plan co-designed by surveyors Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham.[97] The grid plan called for a town of 1 square mile (2.6 km2) centered on a traffic circle (from which Indianapolis's "Circle City" nickname originates).[98] Four diagonal avenues—Indiana (northwest), Kentucky (southwest), Massachusetts (northeast), and Virginia (southeast)—radiated a block from the circle.[99] The city's address numbering system originates at the intersection of Washington (running east–west) and Meridian streets (running north–south).[100]

In the 2020 census, Indianapolis was among the 20 largest cities in the U.S. by both population and land area; however, the city’s population density of 2,455 people per square mile (948/km2) ranked 222nd. This contrast is evident in Indianapolis's cityscape where low-density development patterns dominate and some 14,600 acres (5,900 ha) of farmland remain within its municipal boundaries.[101]

For statistical purposes, the consolidated city-county is organized into 99 "neighborhood areas" with most containing numerous individual historic and cultural districts, subdivisions, and some semi-autonomous towns. In total, some 500 self-identified neighborhood associations are listed in the city's Registered Community Organization system.[102] As a result of the city's expansive land area, Indianapolis has a unique urban-to-rural transect, ranging from dense urban neighborhoods to suburban tract housing subdivisions, to rural villages.[103]

Typical of American cities in the Midwest, Indianapolis urbanized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, resulting in the development of relatively dense, well-defined neighborhoods clustered around streetcar corridors, especially in Center Township.[104] Notable streetcar suburbs include Broad Ripple, Irvington, and University Heights.[105] Starting in the mid-20th century, the post–World War II economic expansion and subsequent suburbanization greatly influenced the city's development patterns. From 1950 to 1970, nearly 100,000 housing units were built in Marion County, most outside Center Township in suburban neighborhoods such as Castleton, Eagledale, and Nora.[105]

Since the 2000s, downtown Indianapolis and surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment mirroring nationwide market trends, driven by empty nesters and millennials.[106][107] Renewed interest in urban living has been met with some dispute regarding gentrification and affordable housing.[108][109][110] According to a Center for Community Progress report, neighborhoods like Cottage Home and Fall Creek Place have experienced measurable gentrification since 2000.[111] The North Meridian Street Historic District is among the most affluent urban neighborhoods in the U.S., with a mean household income of $102,599 in 2017.[112]

More than 260 properties and historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Marion County; most sites are located in Center Township, listed separately. This includes nine National Historic Landmarks: the Athenæum (Das Deutsche Haus), the Benjamin Harrison House, the Broad Ripple Park Carousel, Hinkle Fieldhouse, the Indiana World War Memorial, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the James Whitcomb Riley House, the Madam C. J. Walker Building, and Oldfields.

The Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission oversees 13 local historic districts and five conservation areas.[113] Notable districts include Chatham–Arch and Massachusetts Avenue, Cottage Home, Cumberland, Fletcher Place, Fountain Square, Herron–Morton Place, Irvington, Lockefield Gardens, Lockerbie Square, Monument Circle, New Augusta, the Old Northside, Ransom Place, St. Joseph, the Wholesale District, and Woodruff Place.[114]

The 8-mile-long (13 km) Indiana Central Canal is the oldest extant artificial facility in the city, dating to the 1830s. Between 1985 and 2001, nearly 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of the former canal in downtown Indianapolis were redeveloped into a cultural and recreational amenity. North of 18th Street, the canal retains much of its original appearance, flowing through the northside neighborhoods of Riverside, Butler–Tarkington, Rocky Ripple, and Broad Ripple. This segment has been recognized as an American Water Landmark since 1971.[115][116]

Following the dedication of the 284-foot (87 m) Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in 1902, Indianapolis enacted its first height restriction laws to protect views of the monument.[citation needed] In 1962, the 372-foot (113 m) City-County Building became the first high-rise in the city to surpass the monument’s height.[citation needed] The tallest residential buildings in Indianapolis, the twin 295-foot (90 m) 30-floor Riley Towers, were completed in 1963.[117] The 48-floor Salesforce Tower, completed in 1990, is the city’s tallest, with a roof height of 701 feet (214 m). Its distinctive twin antenna masts bring the building’s height to 811 feet (247 m).[118]

Indiana limestone has been a signature building material in Indianapolis since the 1800s, featured prominently in the city’s monuments, churches, commercial, and civic buildings.[119] Examples include Roberts Park Methodist Episcopal Church (1876), the Indiana Statehouse (1888), the Majestic Building (1896), the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (1902), Birch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse (1905), Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral (1907), the Indianapolis Masonic Temple (1909), Old Indianapolis City Hall (1910), Central Library (1917), the Scottish Rite Cathedral (1927), Circle Tower (1929), the Indiana World War Memorial (1933), the Indiana State Library and Historical Bureau (1934), Clowes Memorial Hall (1963), and OneAmerica Tower (1982).

The city of Indianapolis maintains 212 public parks, totaling 11,258 acres (4,556 ha) or about 5.1% of the city's land area.[120][121] Garfield Park, the city's first municipal park, opened in 1876 as Southern Park.[122][123] George Kessler's Indianapolis Park and Boulevard Plan (1909) linked notable parks, such as Brookside, Ellenberger, Garfield, and Riverside, with a system of parkways following the city's waterways.[124] The system's 3,474 acres (1,406 ha) were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.[125] Eagle Creek Park, Indianapolis's largest and most visited park, ranks among the largest municipal parks in the U.S., covering 4,766 acres (1,929 ha).[126]

Marion County is also home to parks managed by the State of Indiana, including Fort Harrison State Park and White River State Park. Established in 1996, Fort Harrison State Park covers 1,744 acres (706 ha) that are overseen by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.[127] Since 1979, White River has been owned and operated by the White River State Park Development Commission, a quasi-governmental agency.[128] White River's 250 acres (100 ha) are home to several attractions, including the Indianapolis Zoo and White River Gardens. Two land trusts are active in the city managing several sites for nature conservation throughout the region.[129][130]

Indianapolis is situated in the Southern Great Lakes forests ecoregion which in turn is located within the larger temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome, as defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature.[131] Based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's alternative classification system, the city is located in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains, an area of the country known for its fertile soil.[132]

Much of the decidious forests that once covered 98% of the region were cleared for agriculture and urban development, contributing to considerable habitat loss.[131][133] Indianapolis's current urban tree canopy averages approximately 33%.[134] A rare example of old-growth forest in the city can be found on 15 acres (6.1 ha) of Crown Hill Cemetery's North Woods in the Butler–Tarkington neighborhood.[135] The cemetery's 555 acres (225 ha) represents the largest green space in Center Township, home to an abundance of wildlife and some 130 species of trees.[136] Native trees most common to the area include varieties of ash, maple, and oak.[131] Several invasive species are also common in Indianapolis, including tree of heaven, wintercreeper, Amur honeysuckle, and Callery pear.[137][138]

A 2016 bioblitz along three of the city's riparian corridors found 590 taxa.[133] Urban wildlife common to the Indianapolis area include mammals such as the white-tailed deer, eastern chipmunk, eastern cottontail, and the eastern grey and American red squirrels.[131] In recent years, local raccoon and groundhog populations have increased alongside sightings of American badgers, beavers, mink, coyotes, and red fox.[139][140] Birds native to the area include the northern cardinal, wood thrush, eastern screech owl, mourning dove, pileated and red-bellied woodpeckers, and wild turkey.[131] Located in the Mississippi Flyway, the city sees more than 400 migratory bird species throughout the year.[141][142][143] Some 57 species of fish can be found in the city's waterways, including bass and sunfish.[96] Some federally-designated endangered and threatened species are native to the Indianapolis area, including several species of freshwater mussels, the rusty patched bumble bee, Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and the running buffalo clover.[144]

In recent years, the National Wildlife Federation has ranked Indianapolis among the ten most wildlife-friendly cities in the U.S.[145]

Indianapolis has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa) using the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm. It experiences four distinct seasons.[146] The city lies at the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6a and 6b.[147]

Typically, summers are fairly hot, humid, and wet. Winters are generally cold with moderate snowfall. The July daily average temperature is 75.4 °F (24.1 °C). High temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) an average of 18 days each year,[148] and occasionally exceed 95 °F (35 °C). Spring and autumn are usually pleasant, if at times unpredictable. Midday temperature drops exceeding 30 °F or 17 °C are common during March and April, and instances of very warm days (80 °F or 27 °C) followed within 36 hours by snowfall are not unusual during these months. Winters are cold, with an average January temperature of 28.1 °F (−2.2 °C). Temperatures dip to 0 °F (−18 °C) or below an average of 3.7 nights per year.[148]

The rainiest months occur in the spring and summer, with slightly higher averages during May, June, and July. May is typically the wettest, with an average of 5.05 inches (12.8 cm) of rain.[148] Most rain is derived from thunderstorm activity. There is no distinct dry season, although occasional droughts occur. Severe weather is not uncommon, particularly in the spring and summer months. Indianapolis experiences an average of 20 thunderstorm days annually.[149]

Indianapolis's average annual rainfall is 42.4 inches (108 cm). Snowfall averages 25.9 inches (66 cm) per season. Official temperature extremes range from 106 °F (41 °C), set on July 14, 1936,[150] to −27 °F (−33 °C), set on January 19, 1994.[150][151]

The U.S. Census Bureau considers Indianapolis as two entities: the consolidated city and the city's remainder, or balance. The consolidated city is coterminous with Marion County, except the independent municipalities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Southport, and Speedway.[157] The city's balance excludes the populations of ten semi-autonomous municipalities that are included in totals for the consolidated city.[91] These are Clermont, Crows Nest, Homecroft, Meridian Hills, North Crows Nest, Rocky Ripple, Spring Hill, Warren Park, Williams Creek, and Wynnedale.[157][2] An eleventh town, Cumberland, is partially included.[158][159]

In 2015, Brookings characterized the Indianapolis metropolitan area as a minor-emerging immigrant gateway with a foreign-born population of 126,767, or 6.4% of the total population, a 131% increase from 2000.[160] Much of this growth can be attributed to thousands of Burmese-Chin refugees who have settled in Indianapolis, particularly Perry Township, since the late 1990s.[161] Indianapolis is home to one of the largest concentrations of Chin people outside of Myanmar (formerly Burma), with an estimated population ranging from 17,000 to 24,000.[162][163][164]

The Williams Institute reported that the Indianapolis metropolitan area had an estimated 4.6% LGBT adult population in 2020, totaling about 68,000.[165]

At the 2020 census, Indianapolis had a population of 887,642 and a population density of 2,455 people per square mile (948/km2). The estimated population was 880,621 in 2022.[14] By population, Indianapolis is the state's largest city and the country's 16th largest.[172]

The Indianapolis metropolitan area, officially the Indianapolis–Carmel–Greenwood, IN metropolitan statistical area (MSA), consists of Marion County and the surrounding counties of Boone, Brown, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Johnson, Madison, Morgan, Shelby, and Tipton.[173] In 2020, the metropolitan area's population was 2,111,040, the most populous in Indiana and home to 31% of the state's residents. In 2022, the estimated population was 2,141,779.[15] In 2020, the larger Indianapolis–Carmel–Muncie, IN combined statistical area (CSA) had a population of 2,492,514, home to nearly 37% of Indiana residents across 20 of Indiana's 92 counties.[173] In 2022, the estimated population was 2,524,790.[16]

In the 2010 census, 97.2% of the Indianapolis population was reported as one race: 61.8% White, 27.5% Black or African American, 2.1% Asian (0.4% Burmese, 0.4% Indian, 0.3% Chinese, 0.3% Filipino, 0.1% Korean, 0.1% Vietnamese, 0.1% Japanese, 0.1% Thai, 0.1% other Asian); 0.3% American Indian, and 5.5% as other. The remaining 2.8% of the population was reported as multiracial (two or more races).[174] Indianapolis's Hispanic or Latino community was 9.4% of the city's population in the 2010 U.S. Census: 6.9% Mexican, 0.4% Puerto Rican, 0.1% Cuban, and 2% as other.[174] Sometime between 2020 and 2023, Marion County became majority non-white.[175]

In 2010, the median age for Indianapolis was 33.7 years.

The Birch Bayh Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse houses the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Most federal field offices are located in the Minton-Capehart Federal Building. From 1906 to 1991, the U.S. Army operated Fort Benjamin Harrison in neighboring Lawrence. About 5,000 federal employees work for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, headquartered near the former base.[388] Indianapolis is split between two of Indiana's nine congressional districts: Indiana's 7th congressional district, represented by André Carson, and Indiana's 6th congressional district, represented by Jefferson Shreve.

Until fairly recently, Indianapolis was considered one of the most conservative major cities in the U.S.[389][71] According to 2014 research published in the American Political Science Review, the city's policy preferences are less conservative than the national mean when compared with other large U.S. cities.[390] While Indianapolis as a whole leans Democratic, the southern third of the city, consisting of Decatur, Perry, and Franklin townships, trends Republican.[391]

Republicans held the mayor's office for 32 years (1967–1999), and controlled the City-County Council from its inception in 1970 to 2003.[71] In the 2000 United States presidential election, Marion County voters narrowly selected George W. Bush over Al Gore by a margin of 1.3%, but voted in favor of John Kerry by a margin of 1.9% in the 2004 United States presidential election. Presidential election results have increasingly favored Democrats, with Marion County voters selecting Joe Biden over Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election, 63.3–34.3%.[392] Incumbent mayor Democrat Joe Hogsett faced Republican State Senator Jim Merritt and Libertarian Doug McNaughton in the 2019 Indianapolis mayoral election. Hogsett was elected to a second term, with 72% of the vote.[393] The 2019 City-County Council elections expanded Democratic control of the council, flipping six seats to hold a 20–5 supermajority over Republicans.[394]

The Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) comprises seven battalions with 44 fire stations.[395] IFD provides mutual aid to the excluded municipalities of Lawrence and Speedway, as well as Decatur, Pike, and Wayne townships (all of which operate separate fire departments). IFD directs operations for Indiana Task Force 1 (IN-TF1), one of 28 FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force teams in the U.S.[396]

The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) is the city's primary law enforcement agency. IMPD's jurisdiction covers Marion County, excluding the municipalities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Southport, and Speedway (all of which operate separate forces). In 2020, IMPD had 1,700 sworn police personnel and 250 civilian employees across six districts.[397] In 2022, the Community Justice Campus opened, housing the Marion County Sheriff's Office, a new courthouse, jail, and mental health and substance abuse clinic.[398]

The Indiana National Guard's major command units and joint headquarters staff are based at the former Stout Army Air Field on the city's southwest side.[399]

Unlike other major Midwest cities like Detroit and Chicago, the homicide rate for Indianapolis remained below the national average throughout the 1990s.[400] Homicides hit a spike in 1998 when the city reached 162 murders. Murders drastically decreased in the following years but spiked again in 2006 with 153 murders.[401] Until 2019, annual criminal homicide numbers had grown each year since 2011, reaching record highs from 2015 to 2018.[402] With 144 criminal homicides, 2015 surpassed 1998 as the year with the most murder investigations in the city. With 159 criminal homicides, 2018 stands as the most violent year on record in the city.[402] FBI data showed a 7% increase in violent crimes committed in Indianapolis, outpacing the rest of the state and country.[403] Law enforcement has blamed increased violence on a combination of root causes, including poverty, substance abuse, and mental illness.[404]

Nine K–12 public school districts serve residents of the consolidated city as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau (which includes the balance and included cities, and does not include the excluded cities):[406]

Beech Grove City Schools and Speedway School Town only include sections of excluded cities.

Indianapolis Public Schools is the largest district in the city, enrolling about 23,000 students across 60 schools.[407] In 2015, the district began contracting with charter organizations and nonprofit managers to operate failing schools.[408] About 63% of the district's students attend traditional neighborhood or magnet schools, while the remaining 37% are enrolled in independently managed schools.[409][410] About 18,000 students are enrolled in tuition-free charter schools sponsored by the Indianapolis Mayor's Office of Education Innovation and Indianapolis Charter School Board.[411]

Indianapolis is home to two state-supported residential schools, the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired and Indiana School for the Deaf. According to the Indiana Department of Education, about 75 private, parochial, and independent charter schools operate throughout Marion County. Roman Catholic and Christian parochial primary and secondary schools are most prevalent.[412][413] Notable independent private schools include the International School of Indiana,[414] the Orchard School,[415] and Park Tudor School[416] in Meridian Hills.[417]

The city is home to two four-year public university campuses: Indiana University Indianapolis and Purdue University in Indianapolis. The two institutions jointly operated Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) until its dissolution in 2024.[366] IU Indianapolis is an R1[418] urban research university that enrolls about 25,000 students in 330 different bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs.

Urban sprawl and the absence of a comprehensive regional public transit system have contributed to Indianapolis residents driving more vehicle miles per capita than any other U.S. city.[468] According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 83.7% of working residents in the city commuted by driving alone, 8.4% carpooled, 1.5% used public transportation, and 1.8% walked. About 1.5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 3.1% of working city residents worked at home.[469] In 2015, 10.5 percent of Indianapolis households lacked a car, which decreased to 8.7 percent in 2016, the same as the national average in that year. Indianapolis averaged 1.63 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.[470]

Four primary Interstate Highways intersect the city: Interstate 65, Interstate 69, Interstate 70, and Interstate 74. The metropolitan area also has two auxiliary Interstate Highways: a beltway (Interstate 465) and connector (Interstate 865). The Indiana Department of Transportation manages all Interstates, U.S. Highways, and state roads within the city. The city's Department of Public Works maintains more than 3,400 miles (5,500 km) of local streets in addition to alleys, sidewalks, curbs, and 510 bridges.[471]

Sidewalks are absent from nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of the city's roadways,[471] contributing to Indianapolis's low walkability among peer U.S. cities.[472] However, city officials have increased investments in bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in recent years.[468] About 110 miles (180 km) of trails and greenways form the core of the city's active transportation network, connecting into 115 miles (185 km) of on-street bike lanes.[473][306] Popular routes include the Fall Creek Greenway, Monon Trail, and Pleasant Run Greenway.[465] The privately managed Indianapolis Cultural Trail operates Indiana Pacers Bikeshare, the city's bicycle-sharing system, which consists of 525 bicycles and 50 stations.[474]

IndyGo operates and manages the city's public bus system, including bus rapid transit, microtransit, and paratransit services. The Julia M. Carson Transit Center serves as the downtown hub for 27 of its 31 fixed routes.[475][465] In 2020, IndyGo's fleet of 212 buses provided about 4.8 million passenger trips (compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic ridership of 9.2 million in 2019).[476] The Central Indiana Regional Transportation Authority is a quasi-governmental agency that organizes regional car and vanpools and operates three public shuttle buses connecting Indianapolis to employment centers in suburban Plainfield and Whitestown.[477]

Located in the enclave of Beech Grove, the Beech Grove Shops serve as Amtrak's primary heavy maintenance and overhaul facility.[483] About 282 miles (454 km)[465] of freight rail lines traverse the city, including one Class I railroad (CSX Transportation), one Class II railroad (Indiana Rail Road), and two shortline railroads (Indiana Southern Railroad and Louisville and Indiana Railroad).

AES Indiana supplies electricity to more than 500,000 Indianapolis customers[484] and maintains 90,000 street lights.[485] Natural gas, water, and wastewater utilities are provided by Citizens Energy Group.[486] The company's thermal division operates the Perry K. Generating Station which produces and distributes steam for heating and cooling to about 160 customers in downtown Indianapolis.[487] The city's water supply is sourced from the White River and its tributaries as well as aquifers via four surface water treatment plants, four reservoirs, and five groundwater pumping stations throughout the region.[488]

Area codes 317 and 463 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan assigned to Indianapolis and seven surrounding counties in Central Indiana.

Reworld operates a waste-to-energy plant in the city. About 11% of residents subscribe to private curbside recycling services;[492] however, free public recycling drop-off sites are available throughout the city.[493] Of U.S. cities, Indianapolis is the largest without a universal curbside recycling program, resulting in one of the lowest landfill diversion rates.[492][494]

Healthcare in Indianapolis is provided by about 20 hospitals, most belonging to the private, non-profit hospital networks of Ascension St. Vincent Health, Community Health Network,[495] and IU Health.[496] Several are teaching hospitals affiliated with the IU School of Medicine or Marian University's Tom and Julie Wood College of Osteopathic Medicine.

Beaver Falls is a city in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 9,005 at the 2020 census.[3] Located 31 miles (50 km) northwest of Pittsburgh, the city lies along the Beaver River, six miles (9 km) north of its confluence with the Ohio River. It is a part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

The area of present-day Beaver Falls was first mentioned in 1770 in the journals of David Zeisberger, a Moravian Church missionary who eventually settled in present-day Lawrence County. A Lenape chief named Pakanke took Zeisberger to the valley surrounding the Beaver River, where the Lenape owned a large tract of open land which Zeisberger was given access to.[4] In April 1770, Zeisberger and his followers set out in 16 canoes down the Allegheny and Ohio rivers, reaching the mouth of the Beaver three days later. They made their way up to what was called the “Falls of the Beaver," where they encamped.[4] The town originally formed around the middle falls area was named Brighton after Brighton, England, which was the hometown of the area's surveyors.[4]

Despite early promise through the canal business on the falls, the town fell behind neighboring New Brighton after repeated poor economic periods. The earlier proprietors sold the land to the Harmony Society in 1859.[4] The Harmonists immediately brought in surveyors to re-plan Brighton, laying out a town twice the size of the original, paving several main streets with brick and officially changing the name of the community to Beaver Falls.[4] The rapid revitalization of the community allowed it to gain borough status on November 9, 1868. In the 1870s, Beaver Falls had a Chinatown and had up to 225 Chinese residents, brought in to work at Beaver Falls Cutlery Company moved in to the borough by the Harmonists.[5][6]

In 1932, the Borough of College Hill merged with the city, nearly doubling its size.[7]

On May 31, 1985, an F3 tornado hit just north of the city as it went across northern portions of Beaver County, as part of the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak.[8]

The population declined nearly 50% between 1940 and 2000, which is attributed mostly to its central location in the Rust Belt.[9][10][11]

Since the 2021 election cycle, the mayor has been Kenya Johns.[15]

Clinton County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 37,450.[4] Its county seat is Lock Haven.[5]  Clinton County comprises the Lock Haven, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Williamsport-Lock Haven, PA Combined Statistical Area. The county is part of the Central region of the commonwealth.[a]

In the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, new lands in Pennsylvania were purchased from the  Haudenosaunee for colonial settlement, including parts of what is now Clinton County. The land was formally associated with  Northumberland County, but a group of organized settlers near modern  Jersey Shore elected three commissioners each March who were responsible for seeing that everyone was dealt with fairly. This became known as the  Fairplay System. Most of the rulings seem to have dealt with property issues, but they dealt with any legal or criminal cases in their area. They granted permission for new settlers to enter the area, could take away a settler's land claim if they were absent more than six weeks (except for military service), and could expel a person (by setting them adrift in a canoe on the river).
The county was created on June 21, 1839, from parts of Centre and Lycoming Counties.

The county name is in honor of the sixth Governor of New York, DeWitt Clinton. Some alternate sources suggest the namesake is Henry Clinton.[6]

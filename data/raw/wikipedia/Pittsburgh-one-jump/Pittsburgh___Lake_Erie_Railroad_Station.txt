The Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, now Landry's Grand Concourse restaurant in Station Square Plaza in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is an historic building that was erected in 1898. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.[4]

The Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station served as the depot for the passenger rail operations of the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad and the Pittsburgh depot from 1934 into the 1960s. Many of the trains making stops here were trains of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which were making their way to Pittsburgh from Baltimore, Washington, Chicago, Detroit, and St. Louis.[5]

In 1934, the B&O obtained trackage rights on the P&LE from New Castle  Junction to McKeesport and, until the discontinuance of its passenger service, used the P&LE station to reduce the amount of heavy-curvature trackage required to reach the original B&O station on the opposite side of the  Monongahela River.[6]

The station closed in 1985 after the last commuter train to College Hill station was discontinued.

The Pittsburgh Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.[4]

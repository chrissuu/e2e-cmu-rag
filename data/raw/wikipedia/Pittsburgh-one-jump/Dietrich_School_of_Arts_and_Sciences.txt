The Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences (Dietrich School or School of Arts and Sciences) is one of the 17 schools and colleges of University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  A direct descendant of the 1787-chartered Pittsburgh Academy, and the oldest part of the university,[1]: 501  the school serves as "the  liberal arts core" of the university;[2] some 30 departments and programs provide instruction in natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences to all students at the Pittsburgh campus in Oakland. The school is the largest graduate school in the Pittsburgh area.

Founded by Hugh Henry Brackenridge as the Pittsburgh Academy and chartered in 1787,[4] the School of Arts and Sciences may have originally grown out of a school that was active before the charter was granted,[1]: 26 [5] perhaps as early as 1770.[6][7] Thus the SAS began its life as a preparatory school, presumably in a log cabin, in what is now downtown Pittsburgh, which was then on the frontier of the United States. The school was established on the principles of  teaching the rudiments of the "sacred six" of the Scottish universities, as Brackenridge was himself Scottish.[1]: 27    Within a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status. The school took the name the Western University of Pennsylvania.[8]

By the 1830s, the school faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional  liberal education in favor of the state legislature's desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to  remain committed to liberal education nearly ended the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.[9] Similar pressure to abandon the liberal arts focus of the school occurred again between 1902 and 1908 when industrial development in the region was attracting more students to technical trades. Financial pressure mounted to abandon the traditional liberal arts curriculum and focus on more vocational training, but petitions from students, alumni, faculty and some trustees kept the original mission intact.[1]: 503–505 

Out of the school, which by then was often referred to as "the College", came the genesis for some of the university's other schools, such as the School of Engineering and School of Law. Both continued to require the traditional classical studies for a bachelor's degree, but they began to formally separate around the time when the university moved to its new location in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, when it also changed its name to the University of Pittsburgh in 1908.[1]: 503–505   With the formal separation from the school of engineering, the school became known as the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Several of the school's departments, like mathematics and chemistry, have an unbroken line of professors from the Pittsburgh Academy.[1]: 517  Courses such as astronomy, chemistry, English, mathematics, modern languages, and classics, are essentially descended from the academy and resemble the course listings of the day.[1]: 512 

In the summer of 2006, the School of Arts and Sciences began to oversee the administration of the University’s College of General Studies,[10][11] expanding the community of Arts and Sciences learners to include nontraditional students. On September 22, 2011, it was announced that an alumnus of the school's Department of Political Science, William S. Dietrich II, had donated $125 million to the university, the largest ever donation to the university up until that time, and that the university would rename the School of Arts and Sciences to honor his father, Kenneth.[12][13] Since July 2023, Adam K. Leibovich has served as the school's Bettye J. and Ralph E. Bailey Dean.[14]  The position is named after a couple that donated $3 million to the school in November 2007 using profits from high-ranking positions with Consol Energy, Conoco, and Fuel Tech, as Bettye had graduated from Pitt's College of General Studies with a BA in 1984.[15]

The School of Arts and Sciences graduate programs offer MA, MS, MFA, and PhD programs in 34 concentrations, as well as a wide range of interdisciplinary programs.[16]

Certificate programs allow students to complete a concentrated area of study in addition to their major. Certificates typically require 18-24 credits, are noted the student's transcript upon graduation. 

Certificates can also be obtained from the University Center for International Studies.

Many of the programs offered within the School of Arts and Sciences are considered among the best in the nation. For instance, the Department of Philosophy,[19] is considered one of the top five in the United States,[20] and the Department of History and Philosophy of Science,[21] consistently ranked at the top of the field.[22][23][24]

Other rankings, including those by the National Research Council and U.S. News & World Report, include the following programs among the best in the nation:[25][26][27]

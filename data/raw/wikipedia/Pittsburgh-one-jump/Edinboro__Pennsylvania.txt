Edinboro is a borough in Erie County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,920 at the 2020 census.[5] It is a small college town, home to Pennsylvania Western University, Edinboro. It is part of the Erie metropolitan area.

Members of the Eriez, Iroquois, and Cornplanter Native tribes were the first known inhabitants of the area that is now known as Edinboro. These nations called the region Conneauttee, meaning "land of the living snowflake". William Culbertson moved to the area in 1801, building a gristmill near Conneauttee Lake.[6]

From 1801 to 1825, the roots of the town were formed when congregations of Presbyterian and Methodist churches began moving to the area and building houses and churches, some of which are still standing today. The first settler, William Culbertson, built the first school around 1825. The first post office was built around 1837 when it was included in the Erie and Crawford counties' postal routes. The farms helped the area grow during this time, and the area was incorporated in 1840 with a population of 232 at about 500 acres (200 ha). A turnpike between Erie and Meadville was constructed in the 1840s; it was made of wooden planks, and completed in 1852. In 1857, an academy was started, which was renamed the State Normal School in 1861, and which would eventually become Pennsylvania Western University, Edinboro.[6]

A trolley station was built by the railway company (which railway company is apparently unknown). That company built an electric railway in the 1900s which drew more traffic to the area. Fires in 1902, 1905, and 1909, destroyed most of the wood-framed, commercial buildings, many of which were replaced with brick structures that are still standing today. Many more houses, condominiums, and apartments were constructed from 1910 through the 1950s, as Edinboro promoted itself, mainly to the surrounding populations in Pittsburgh and Erie as a resort area by the lake.  This promotion boosted tourism, while the college gained enrollment and drew more residents to the town.[6]

The 1960s was a significant growth period for the town, as around 400 building permits were issued for both housing and business. A post office was built in 1960, and evolved to first class status by 1966. The demand for water consumption had tripled throughout this period, and prompted the construction of a new sewage plant in 1970.[6]

The borough's home rule charter was adopted in 1974, with a new municipal building being constructed in 1975. In 1980, the census placed Edinboro first in population growth in Erie County, with a population increase of 30% from 1970 to 1980 to a total of 6,324. Today, Edinboro is known as a college town in the winter and lake resort during the summer.

Academy Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.[7]

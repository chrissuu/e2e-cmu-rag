Dennis Publishing bought Mental Floss in 2011.

Mental Floss was acquired by Minute Media from the Felix Dennis estate in September 2018.[13]

The magazine was co-founded by William E. Pearson and Mangesh Hattikudur while they were students at Duke University. According to the Mental Floss website, the idea came from conversations in the Duke cafeteria about the need for an entertaining educational magazine.[14] According to Hattikudur, they wanted to "distill some of the best lectures from our favorite college professors. We thought if we could bottle their enthusiasm and deliver it in monthly installments, it'd be great."[10]

Later, Pearson met with president of Duke University, who loved the idea, but disliked the name. The first published issue, known as the "Campus Edition", was published in spring 2000, distributing 3,000 issues.

The founders spent much of their first year looking for investors and staff members while raising funds to publish the first issue, which was released in May 2001. Over the following summer, 8,000 copies were distributed, and 60% sold out on newsstands.[15] Pearson and Hattikidur were named two of thirty promising 2007 entrepreneurs in business magazine Inc.[16]

Mental Floss was sold to magazine mogul Felix Dennis in 2011[17] and again to Minute Media in late 2018.[18]

Beginning in June 2017, Pearson and Hattikudur have been producing the podcast Part Time Genius,[19] a variety style knowledge show, created in partner with HowStuffWorks. In addition to the magazine, a board game, a weekly CNN Headline News segment and a daily updated website, the two have collaborated on seven Mental Floss books.

Mangesh Hattikudur is an American businessman who co-founded Mental Floss, with Pearson when both were students at Duke University.[20] Hattikudur graduated from Duke in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. The Huffington Post in 2010 wrote that Hattikudur and Pearson have created a knowledge empire complete with board games, T-shirts, and a website called mentalfloss.com which has monthly visitors tallying into the millions.[21] They have collaborated on books such as The Mental Floss History of the United States along with writer Erik Sass.[20]

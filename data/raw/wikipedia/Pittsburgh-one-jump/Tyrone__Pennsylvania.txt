Tyrone is a borough in Blair County, Pennsylvania, United States, located 15 miles (24 km) northeast of Altoona, on the Little Juniata River. Tyrone was of considerable commercial importance in the twentieth century. It was an outlet for the Clearfield coal fields and was noted for manufacturing paper products. There were planing mills and chemical and candy factories. In 1900, 5,847 people lived here; in 1910, 7,176; and in 1940, 8,845 people resided here. The population was 5,477 at the 2010 census.

Located along the main lines of the Norfolk Southern and Nittany and Bald Eagle railroads, and U.S. Route 220, Pennsylvania Route 453, and Interstate 99 highways, Tyrone was at one time known as "The Hub of the Highways". In those days, four railroads [Pennsylvania, Tyrone and Clearfield, Tyrone and Lock Haven, Lewisburg, and Tyrone] and three main highways [US-220, PA-350, PA-453] converged there.

The Tyrone Borough Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.[5]

On May 30, 1893, a train carrying employees and animals belonging to the Walter L. Main Circus derailed at an embankment resulting in the deaths of five circus employees, plus many animal casualties. Many unharmed animals escaped from the wreck and were reported across the countryside for months after the wreck, most notably, a woman who escaped a Bengal tiger, but lost her cow in the attack. A memorial now stands at the site.[6]

On June 2, 1998, an F1 tornado moved southeast along Pennsylvania Route 453 northwest of Tyrone. Significant tree damage was noted in several locations along a four-mile path, beginning approximately five miles northwest of Tyrone. No significant damage was reported in Tyrone, although eyewitnesses reported seeing clouds rotating as they crossed the city. This tornado was part of the 1998 Eastern Tornado Outbreak.

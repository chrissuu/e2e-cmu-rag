Springdale is a borough in northeastern Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, 18 miles (29 km) northeast of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River. The population was 3,400 at the 2020 census.[4] The borough became official in 1906, after breaking away from the township.

Springdale Borough was incorporated in 1906, when it broke away from the larger Springdale Township, and was named after the natural springs and the surrounding small valley, or the "dale." The area was originally inhabited by Native American tribes, but soon overtaken by Europeans. The town became a bustling railroad town and a hub for the coal industry in the late 1800s and the early 1900s. Springdale originally got its name in the year 1820 by either Hannah Keene or her daughter, Frances Keene. Before this, the town is believed to have been known as "Deertown."[5] Today, Springdale is a quiet residential community with a small downtown area and many small businesses.

The first European settlers arrived in the area in the early 1800s. Among these settlers were familiar surnames such as Mellon, Henderson, Remaley, Shoop, Brackenridge, Denny, Pillow, Keene, Hanna, Coe, and Moyer. Several streets in Springdale today are named after these families.

The Dapper Dan Open was a professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour that was played intermittently in the 1930s and 1940s. It was sponsored by Dapper Dan Charities, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based charitable organization founded in 1936 as a businessman's sports club by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette sports editor Al Abrams. Dapper Dan evolved into one of western Pennsylvania's premier sports charities with six fund raising events throughout the year, including Pittsburgh's oldest, largest and most-prestigious annual sports banquet.[1] The organization awarded its top honor to golfer Arnold Palmer in 1960.[2]

Arnold Palmer's first ever PGA tournament was the Dapper Dan when he was just 16 years old.[3]

The tournament was played at the Wildwood Country Club in Allison Park, Pennsylvania in 1939. After a break of nine years, the tournament resumed in 1948 at the Alcoma Country Club in Pittsburgh.

Adding a formed borough, Whitehall: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania 162.51.15.113 (talk) 14:49, 5 December 2019 (UTC)[reply]

I have added this borough to the list, and since it is little remembered and a bit confusing, I explain it here.  It was carved out of Reserve Twp in 1849, running along the north shore of the Allegheny from what was then the northern border of Allegheny city to the township boundary near Girty's Run, and included Herrs Island.  It was disincorporated in 1868 and partitioned, with Herrs Island, the adjacent and downriver bottomland annexed to Allegheny City, while that portion of riverfront from the northern end of Herrs Island upriver was added to land from Shaler Twp to form Millvale.  I have included dates in the listing so it is not confused with the distinct modern borough, and for want of a better choice I linked it to Troy Hill, which is the inhabited part of Pittsburgh that includes former Duquesne borough land (even though the part of Troy Hill neighborhood that was Duquesne is now only inhabited by the East Ohio Street/Rt 28 corridor).

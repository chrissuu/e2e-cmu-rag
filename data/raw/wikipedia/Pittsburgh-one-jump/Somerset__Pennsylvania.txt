Somerset (/ˈsʌmərsɛt/ SUM-ər-set) is a borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat.[3] The population was 6,046 at the 2020 census.[2] The borough is surrounded by Somerset Township and is located off the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70 and I-76). Somerset is the principal city of the Somerset micropolitan statistical area, which consists of Somerset County, and is also a principal city of the larger Johnstown-Somerset combined statistical area.

Somerset was a central stage for the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.  Several rebellion leaders, including Harmon Husband, lived in Somerset.  The federal militia sent to put down the rebellion worked from its headquarters in the nearby town of Berlin.

A major fire on the afternoon of May 9, 1872, destroyed a significant portion of the town within just a few hours.[4]

In July 2002, nine miners were trapped for 77 hours, 240 feet (73 m) underground, by flooding in the Quecreek coal mine, just outside Somerset.  All nine miners were rescued.  The Quecreek Mine Rescue was chronicled by journalists from around the world and was televised globally.

Somerset Crater on Mars was named after the borough in 2006.

The Somerset County Courthouse and Uptown Somerset Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[5]

Somerset has the ninth-highest elevation of towns in Pennsylvania, at 2,190 feet (670 m) above sea level.[7] Somerset County is in Appalachia.

Somerset has a humid continental climate that is affected by the high elevation, rendering it colder much of the winter than Altoona, Johnstown, or State College, despite being well south of these locations. Its climate is quite similar to those seen in northern Pennsylvania, although the average winter high temperatures are slightly higher. Somerset holds the June and November record low records for the state of Pennsylvania. Somerset is also the only place in Pennsylvania to receive accumulations of snow in June (other places received a partial dusting at most) when it received three inches of snow from the same polar front that caused it to drop to 20 degrees on June 10, 1913. Because of arctic air, powdery snow fell. It was photographed being swept off porches with brooms. That same cold snap brought snow to many other Pennsylvania communities, especially in the northern counties.

Dormont is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,244 at the 2020 census.[3] It is a residential suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Loosely translated, Dormont means "Mountain of Gold" in French.

The territory in which Dormont Borough is situated was held by the Delaware and Shawnee tribes until 1768, when the territory was part of the transaction in which Fort Stanwix was purchased from the Six Nations. In following years, Dormont's area was part of Cumberland County, Pitt Township in Bedford County, Penn Township in Washington County, and finally, St. Clair Township in Allegheny County in 1788.[4]

Dormont was originally fashioned from parts of Scott and Union Townships. An order of incorporation was signed on March 31, 1909, making Dormont the first independent municipality in the South Hills of Allegheny County. Municipal officials initially wanted to name the new community "Mt. Lebanon"; however, objections were raised by their as yet unincorporated neighbors to the south, who eventually adopted the name. Instead, the name Dormont was chosen from the Americanized version of the French term "mont d'or", loosely translated as "Mountain of Gold."[5]

The first election of borough officials was held on April 27, 1909. Dormont later annexed part of Scott Township in 1909, two additional parts of Union Township in 1913 and 1916, and a portion of Mt. Lebanon Township in January 1921, giving it a total area of just less than one square mile. With the construction of the streetcar tunnel and the Liberty Tunnels came rapid growth.

Once the borough of Dormont was incorporated in 1909, at least 30 different streets were given new names. Today, all but two of Dormont's "side streets" are designated as avenues, the exceptions being Memorial Drive and Park Blvd. Two of Dormont's mainline streets, Scott Road and McFarland Road, are two-lane "borough line" streets in which one lane is located in Dormont and the other in Mt. Lebanon. The northern stretch of another "borough line" street, McNeilly Avenue, runs through Dormont on one side and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Brookline on the other. Before the incorporation and street name changes, Dormont actually had four designated "streets": Beech St. (Dwight Ave.), Sycamore St. (Philadelphia Ave.), Sylvester St. (Texas Ave.) and "C" St. (Miles Ave.).

In June 2020, the Dormont Borough Council approved a comprehensive plan for the next ten years, which includes provisions for land use, housing, transportation, economic development, parks and recreation, community facilities, historic preservation, sustainability, and public engagement.[6] The council also adopted a $9.8 million budget for 2021 without a tax increase for residents.[7] The Keystone Oaks School District, after a stint of fully remote learning, resumed in-person instruction for all students starting in February 2021.[8]

Its citizens enjoy one of the largest swimming pools in Pennsylvania (>60,000 square feet), two parks, basketball and tennis courts, two Little League fields, a fine library, an impressive volunteer-built children's playground, as well as seasonal activities for both children and adults. "Dormont Day," the annual Fourth of July park-wide event, is the highlight of the summer season and features all day family entertainment beginning with the 8:00 a.m. Twenty-One Gun Salute and culminating with one of the most spectacular fireworks displays for a community of this size. During the day, park goers are treated to live music, picnics, food booths, games, pony rides, and youth foot races.

Organizations such as the Dormont Historical Society, the Dormont Library, the Dormont Arts & Culture Committee, and the Dormont Community Development Corporation work to promote and preserve the culture of Dormont. Annual events like Dormont Pride, Dormont Ethnic Food Festival, and Dormont Multicultural Day celebrate its cultural diversity and inclusivity.[6]

Since 1965, Dormont's school system, Keystone Oaks School District, is a jointure with the boroughs of Castle Shannon and Green Tree. The borough itself includes Dormont Elementary School, Keystone Oaks Middle School and Keystone Oaks High School. Oddly enough, none of the three communities which make up the Keystone Oaks School District are contiguous. Also, the Keystone Oaks Middle and High Schools are located just outside the Dormont Borough line in neighboring Mt. Lebanon.

Dormont Elementary School is located on the site of the old Dormont High School on Annapolis Ave. When the Keystone Oaks High School building was completed in 1969, the old high school was changed to Jay Neff Middle School, named after the superintendent of Dormont schools. In 1996, the old middle school was demolished, and Keystone Oaks High School expanded to include Keystone Oaks Middle School. A brand-new building for the grade school was then built, bringing together students from the two previous grade schools, Kelton and Hillsdale. The Kelton School building, located on a hillside adjacent to Keystone Oaks (corner of Kelton & Delwood Aves.), was razed also in 1996; it is now occupied with a soccer field. Hillsdale School (Hillsdale Ave. between Glenmore and Espy Aves.) is now the Dormont Municipal Building which also houses the Dormont Historical Society.

Dormont is also home to the South Hills Beauty Academy and the Pittsburgh Bartending School.

Dormont has a comprehensive public works department responsible for services like street maintenance, snow removal, leaf collection, recycling, trash collection, and operating the Dormont Stormwater Authority.[6]

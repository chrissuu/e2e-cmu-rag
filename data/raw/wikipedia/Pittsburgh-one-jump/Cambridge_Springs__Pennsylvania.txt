Cambridge Springs is a borough with home rule status in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 2,583 at the 2020 census,[4] down from 2,595 at the 2010 census.[6]

The village of Cambridge was settled in 1822 and named for the town of Cambridge, Massachusetts.[7][8] It was incorporated into the borough of Cambridgeboro on April 3, 1866.[7][9]

In the late 19th century, Cambridgeboro was known for its mineral springs. The discovery of the springs eventually led to the borough being renamed to Cambridge Springs on April 1, 1897.[9] It was a resort town featuring a variety of hotels including the Rider Hotel, which burned down in 1931. The last of these hotels, the Riverside Inn, burned down on May 2, 2017, and had been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1978. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Cambridge Springs Bridge and Amos Kelly House.[10]

In 1904, the Rider Hotel in Cambridge Springs was the site of a famous chess tournament won by Frank Marshall ahead of World Champion Emanuel Lasker and fourteen other players. A variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined opening played several times there is today known as the Cambridge Springs Defense (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Nbd7 5.e3 c6 6.Nf3 Qa5 in algebraic notation).

From 1912 to 1987, it was home to Alliance College. In 1912, United States President William Howard Taft traveled to Cambridge Springs for the dedication. The site of the college is now occupied by the State Correctional Institution – Cambridge Springs, a minimum-security prison.

In the early 20th century, the town became a "veritable 'Mecca' to chronic hoboes" who were interested in meeting Leon Ray Livingston, the famed hobo and author who had established Cambridge Springs as his home base while not traveling.

The borough adopted a home rule charter on May 21, 1974, that took effect on January 5, 1976.[11] While the community's official name remains the "Borough of Cambridge Springs", it is no longer subject to the Pennsylvania Borough Code.

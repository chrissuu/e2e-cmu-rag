Spring Township is a township in Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 28,396 at the 2020 census, making it the second most populous municipality in Berks County after Reading.

In 1850, the Township of Cumru included about 33,000 acres of land, with a population of 3,853, making it the most populous district in the county outside of Reading. In area, this was the largest township. In the decade before, two unsuccessful attempts were made to divide Cumru on account of its great extent. In 1850, a third attempt was made. The petition called for a division line situated to the west of the line requested in previous petitions, beginning at the “Harrisburg Bridge” and extending southward to the Lancaster County lines, at the corner of Brecknock Township, and it was inscribed by only 45 taxable inhabitants of the township. The court appointed Aaron Albright, Richard Boone and Michael K. Boyer as commissioners to inquire into advisability of the proposed division. The commissioners, after viewing Cumru Township, divided it and recommended the western part to be designated as a new township under the name of “Spring”. The name was derived from a large fresh water spring in the central portion of the area. Because of the limestone fissures under the ground, the spring periodically appeared and disappeared. The early settlers, who used it for their daily water supplies, referred to it as the “Sinking Spring”. The boundary lines of the township were described as enclosing some 15,000 acres. The report was presented for these boundaries on August 5, 1850. The Court confirmed the report on November 23, 1850, and formed the new township calling it the Township of Spring.[3]

Wertz's Covered Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[4]

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 18.3 square miles (47.3 km2), of which 18.2 square miles (47.2 km2)  is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2)  (0.22%) is water. Since it extends from near the Schuylkill River in the northeast to the Lancaster County border in the southwest, the township's terrain varies considerably. Most is drained to the Schuylkill, except for the southwestern end, which is in the Susquehanna watershed and drains via the Conestoga River. While much of the north is low-lying, much of the southwest is mountainous. The Cacoosing Creek forms the natural northwestern boundary and flows into the Tulpehocken Creek, which in turn forms the natural northeastern boundary.

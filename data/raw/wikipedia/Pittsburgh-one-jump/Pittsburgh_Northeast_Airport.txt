Pittsburgh Northeast Airport (FAA LID: 9G1) was a privately owned, public use airport in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States.[1] The airport is currently abandoned.[2] The airport is located 12 nautical miles (14 mi, 22 km) north-northeast of the central business district of Pittsburgh,[1] in West Deer Township. The airport is located a few miles north of Pittsburgh Mills shopping mall.

Pittsburgh Northeast Airport covers an area of 149 acres (60 ha) at an elevation of 1,063 feet (324 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 17/35 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,550 by 100 feet (1,082 x 30 m).[1]

For the 12-month period ending November 23, 2011, the airport had 2,982 aircraft operations, an average of 248 per month: 99% general aviation and 1% military. At that time there were 20 aircraft based at this airport: 95% single-engine and 5% multi-engine.[1] As of March 2019, no aircraft are based in the facility.[3]

The property went through a major overhaul between 2000 and 2004, and can now accommodate larger aircraft.[citation needed] The airport's former runway, designated 2/20, had an asphalt surface measuring 2,645 by 36 feet (806 x 11 m).[4]

This airport was included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2009–2013, which categorized it as a general aviation facility.[5] It was originally known as West Penn Airport.[citation needed]

Formerly known as Rock Airport, Pittsburgh Northeast Airport was bought for $9 million in 2014 by Alaskan Property Management, a subsidiary of Management Science Associates, after the former owner filed for bankruptcy.[3]

In 2022, the airport was used by Carnegie Mellon University and used to test drones.[6]

On May 11, 2011, shortly after 1:45pm two students, a science teacher, and a pilot attempted a takeoff on runway 35. They went off the end of the runway and fell off the bank.[7]

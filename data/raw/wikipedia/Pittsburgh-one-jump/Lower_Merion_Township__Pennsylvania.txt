Lower Merion Township is a township in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Philadelphia Main Line. The township's name originates with the county of Merioneth in north Wales. Merioneth is an English-language transcription of the Welsh Meirionnydd.

A number of Main Line suburbs are located in Lower Merion, west of Philadelphia, the sixth largest city in the United States as of 2020. With a population of 63,633, Lower Merion Township is the ninth-most populous municipality in Pennsylvania as of the 2020 U.S. census.[3]

The center of Lower Merion Township is located 11.9 miles (19.2 km) northwest of central Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city-county, and parts of Lower Merion border this section of the city.

Lower Merion Township was first settled in 1682 by Welsh Quakers, who were granted a tract of land, the Welsh Tract, by William Penn. In 1713, Lower Merion was established as an independent Township with about 52 landholders and tenants. In 1900, the Township was incorporated as a Township of the First Class. Lower Merion is home to the oldest continuously used place of worship in the United States, the Merion Friends Meeting House, used continuously since 1695.

On April 4, 1991, U.S. Senator John Heinz died while as a passenger in a Piper Aerostar propeller aircraft when it collided with a Bell 412 helicopter over the Merion Elementary School in the Merion air disaster. The other four people in both aircraft also died, and the falling debris from the aircraft also caused the death of two elementary students and injured five others.[4]

The Mill Creek Historic District, and Seville Theatre are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[5] Green Hill Farms was added in 2011.

In 2010, the township received national media attention when a student filed a lawsuit, Robbins v. Lower Merion School District, after a school administrator used the webcam of a school-issued laptop to spy on the student while the student was in his home. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed an amicus brief in support of the student.

In 2012, the Federal Highway Administration modified the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in a way that would have required the replacement of Lower Merion Township's historic street signs, some of which date back to the early 1910s. After some campaigning by local residents and by Senator Pat Toomey, the Lower Merion Board of Commissioners declared, via an ordinance, the entire Lower Merion as a historic district and received a waiver from Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood.[6][7][8]

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 23.9 square miles (61.8 km2), of which 23.7 square miles (61.4 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.4 km2) (0.67%) is water.

The township is bounded by Wynnefield Heights, Belmont Village, Wynnefield, and Overbrook in the city/county of Philadelphia; the boroughs of Conshohocken and West Conshohocken; the townships of Upper Merion; Whitemarsh;  Haverford; and Radnor. The borough of Narberth, a separate political entity of one-half square mile, is completely surrounded by the township.

Forming the township's southern border is City Avenue, known to many locals as "City Line", a very busy major artery in this part of the metro area that also separates Montgomery and Philadelphia counties. City Avenue begins at the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76), where it also becomes U.S. Route 1, and between this area south to Bala Cynwyd  is sometimes referred to as the Golden Mile.[9][10]  Many buildings, including the radio and television studios of Philadelphia's NBC and ABC affiliates, PCOM, and the Fox and Germantown Savings Bank towers, line the avenue beside newer office complexes, shopping centers, and restaurants. Situated behind a lot of these spaces are condos and townhomes; several well-known residences are 191 Presidential, Corinthian Condominium and Sutton Terrace. The township's eastern border is along the Schuylkill River.

Before European settlement, Lower Merion's dense forest was home to bears, cougars, wolves, rattlesnakes, otters, beavers, weasels, turkeys, grouses, woodland bison, trout, and bald eagles. When Europeans arrived, they began cutting down the forests, chasing away much of the wildlife. After World War II, Lower Merion transformed from a farming township to a suburban area, and wildlife changed accordingly. Today, red foxes, white-footed mice, horned owls, skunks, raccoons, crayfish, songbirds, butterflies, and white-tailed deer populate the township.[11]

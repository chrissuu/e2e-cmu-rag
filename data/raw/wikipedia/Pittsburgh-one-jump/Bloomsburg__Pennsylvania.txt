Bloomsburg is the only incorporated town in Columbia County, Pennsylvania,[3] United States, of which it is also the county seat. It is part of Northeastern Pennsylvania and is located 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Wilkes-Barre along the Susquehanna River.[4] As of the 2010 census, Bloomsburg had a population of 14,855,[5] with an estimated population of 13,811 in 2019.[6]

The first signs of European settlement date to the year 1772, when James McClure established a log cabin in the area. Until the mid-19th century, it was just a small village, known as Bloom Township. Traditionally, Bloomsburg's founding in 1802 has been ascribed to settler Ludwig Eyer, son of Johann Martin Eyer,[9][10] acting as agent for his brother Johann Adam.[11] For 75 years after the discovery of ore in the area,[when?] Bloomsburg developed a booming iron industry.

Since its incorporation on March 4, 1870, Bloomsburg has held the distinction of being the only town in Pennsylvania.[12][13] While some home rule municipalities may be styled as towns in their charters, they remain classified as either cities, boroughs, or townships. One particular point of confusion regards McCandless in Allegheny County, which remains a township despite taking the name "Town of McCandless" when adopting a home rule charter in 1975.[14] Bloomsburg's slogan of "The only [incorporated] town in Pennsylvania" reflects its unique status.[15]

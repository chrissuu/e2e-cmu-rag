Whitehall Township is a township with home rule status in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township's population was 29,173 as of the 2020 census.[5]

Whitehall Township is a suburb of Allentown in the Lehigh Valley metropolitan region, which had a population of 861,899 and was the 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of the 2020 census.

The township is 4.4 miles (7.1 km) north of Allentown, 64.1 miles (103.2 km) northwest of Philadelphia, and 93.7 miles (150.8 km) west of New York City.[6]

The Province of Pennsylvania was created in 1681 when King Charles II granted a charter of land in America to William Penn.[7]

After the death of Penn, his sons, John, Thomas, and Richard, became the owners of Pennsylvania.[8] The Lenape Indian tribe deeded that part of Lehigh County lying between the South Mountain and Blue Mountain to Penn's sons in 1736.

A wave of German immigrants from Germany's Palatinate settled in Whitehall Township. The first was Jacob Kohler, who settled in the vicinity of Egypt about 1728. The settlers staked their claim on the lands by applying to the Penns for a land warrant. They cleared the land for farming and established churches around which villages grew.

When the first European settlers came to the Whitehall area, the Lenape people were living on the banks of Hokendauqua Creek. The Europeans and the Lenape designed a deal to determine how much land the Europeans would acquire based on how far the Europeans were able to walk in two days. To gain more land, the Europeans paid a professional runner who got as far as what is now Coaldale, in Schuylkill County.

The Lenape lived peacefully among the German settlers for a time. But the tribe suffered injustices at the hands of the settlers and lashed back during a 1763 uprising in Lehigh County. Fort Deshler, which stood near Route 145 at Chestnut Street, played a key role in the defense of settler-held lands during this battle, in which 23 settlers were killed.

The original Whitehall Township, established in 1753, was split into the three townships of Whitehall, North Whitehall, and South Whitehall in 1867. The name Whitehall is said to have originated from Lynford Lardner's hunting lodge that was painted with whitewash.[disputed – discuss] Lardner named it "Grouse Hall", but the common people of the region called it "White Hall". Whitehall Township's villages include Cementon, Egypt, Fullerton, Hokendauqua, Mickleys, Stiles, and West Catasauqua. Coplay was also part of Whitehall until it incorporated as a borough in 1869. Agriculture was the major industry until the mid-1800s. Today, about 2,000 acres (809 ha) are under cultivation. There were six grist mills in Whitehall, built to process grains for the farmers into flour and animal feed. Only one grist mill remains, the Helfrich Springs Grist Mill, which is also home to the Whitehall Historical Preservation Society, which has preserved the building for use as a local history museum.

Completion of the Lehigh Canal in 1829 led to further development. Discovery of iron ore deposits brought Whitehall into the Industrial Revolution when the first blast iron furnace was built in Hokendauqua in 1854. This was immediately followed by the establishment of a railroad system to transport raw materials to the furnaces and to ship the final product. Population grew rapidly as these industries attracted Welsh and Irish immigrants.

While the railroads were being constructed, cuts in the bedrock led to the discovery of Whitehall's deposits of Jacksonburg limestone. David O. Saylor perfected and patented the process of manufacturing Portland cement. The first Portland cement plant was located between the villages of Cementon and Coplay. Others quickly followed, and by 1914 70% of the cement produced in the United States came from the "Cement Belt" or Lehigh District. The cement industry attracted a new wave of immigrants from Austria-Hungary, creating yet another population spurt.

Whitehall became classified as a first class township with a population of 7,935 in 1900. This gave the township specified municipal rights for supplying electric lights, highways, and sewers at public expense. The post-World War II era began the transition from the manufacturing industries to the retail industry as Whitehall became a bedroom community and suburb of Allentown. The individual villages united into a single entity known as Whitehall in 1968, when the U.S. Post Office combined its separate town branches. Breadon Field, which was the home field for a series of Minor League Baseball teams from the stadium's 1948 opening until its 1964 demolition, was based in Whitehall Township.

In 1974, voters approved the adoption of a Home Rule Charter form of government, creating a seven-member legislative body and an elected mayor. Today, with an annual budget in excess of $21 million, Whitehall provides a full range of municipal services to its residents.[9]

Whitehall Township is in eastern Lehigh County on the north side of the city of Allentown. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 12.9 square miles (33.3 km2), of which 12.6 square miles (32.6 km2) are land and 0.3 square miles (0.7 km2), or 2.22%, are water.[2] Whitehall is drained by the Lehigh River, which forms the eastern boundary of the township, separating it from the boroughs of Northampton and North Catasauqua in Northampton County and the borough of Catasauqua in Lehigh County.

The township was originally created on March 20, 1753, and included what is now North Whitehall and South Whitehall townships. In 1810, a petition was made to the Northampton County Court to split the township into two portions; at the time, the area now encompassed by Lehigh County was part of Northampton County. The name "Whitehall" refers to a white hall that was built along Jordan Creek in the early 1700s as a hunting lodge. The area had a large ruffed grouse population along with numerous white-tailed deer, eastern elk, eastern wolves, and black bear. Mountain lions or cougars may have also existed within Whitehall Township at some point in time. Because of the rich biodiversity of the area it became known as the wilderness of Whitehall. Old-growth forest consisting of oak, tulip poplar, hickory, black walnut, sugar maple, basswood, American chestnut, American beech, and sycamore covered the entire township.

In 1867, eastern portions of both North and South Whitehall were reapportioned into the current Whitehall Township. The new Whitehall Township is generally rectangular in shape, running from north-northwest to south-southeast, and is situated along the western bank of the Lehigh River. Two years after the new township's formation, the borough of Coplay was incorporated, removing from the township a square section of 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2).

The township's villages include Cementon, Eagle Point, Egypt, Fullerton, Hokendauqua, Mickleys, North Coplay, Scherersville (also in South Whitehall), Stiles, and West Catasauqua.

Whitehall Township has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) and the hardiness zone is 6b. Average monthly temperatures in Hokendauqua range from 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C) in January to 73.8 °F (23.2 °C) in July.[10]

As of 2025, Whitehall Township is represented by the following federal, state, county, and township officials:

Whitehall Township Bureau of Police is a medium-sized city police force. The first police patrolmen were hire in 1905, and the current police department was formed in 1946.[18] Since then, has been ensuring law and order in the township.

The township's main north–south road is MacArthur Road (PA 145), which has an interchange with US 22 in the south and crosses PA 329 in the north. PA 145 heads south into Allentown and north to Walnutport. US 22 passes east–west through the southern portion of Whitehall Township on a freeway called the Lehigh Valley Thruway, with interchanges at PA 145 and Fullerton Avenue. US 22 leads west to connections with PA 309, I-476, also known as the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension, and I-78 and east to Bethlehem and Easton. PA 329 passes east–west through the northern portion of Whitehall Township on Main Street, leading west to Schnecksville and east to Northampton and Bath.[20]

LANta provides bus service in Whitehall Township with several routes serving the MacArthur Road retail corridor. The bus routes connect the township with Allentown, Bethlehem, and other points in the Lehigh Valley.[21] The transit center at the Lehigh Valley Mall moved because the mall requested LANta to move due to safety concerns.[22]

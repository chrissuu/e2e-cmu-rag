Smithsonian Affiliations is a division of the Smithsonian Institution that establishes long-term partnerships with non-Smithsonian museums and educational and cultural organizations in order to share collections, exhibitions and educational strategies and conduct joint research.[2] Partner organizations are known as "Smithsonian Affiliates".

The Smithsonian Affiliations program was established in 1996 by Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman[3][4] with the approval of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, in response to several challenges the Institution faced at the time: a decrease in federal funding, limited storage space for expanding collections, and the need to make the Institution more reflective of the nation without operating additional museums outside of Washington, D.C.[5]

In 1993, the Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution introduced the first proposal for initiatives promoting strategic, collections-based partnerships at the Institution.  The Commission, composed of 22 members appointed by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, was charged with examining the Institution's ability to uphold James Smithson's vision of an organization dedicated to "the increase and diffusion of knowledge" despite a changing society and increasing financial hardships. Of the four initiatives proposed by the Commission: Educate More of the Nation's People; Collections, Research and Exhibitions; Governance; and Assure the Future, two directly called for the creation of strategic partnerships and making artifacts in the collections accessible to other museums.[6]

To Educate More of the Nation's People: "Build collaborative partnerships with other museums, research centers, and educational institutions throughout the nation."[6]

Collections, Research and Exhibitions:  "Shape a master plan for maintenance of the priceless collections, including the sharing of collections through long-term or permanent loans to partner institutions."[6]

Significant emphasis was placed on the benefits that partnerships with outside museums would create for the Institution.  By dispersing artifacts to museums in a responsible way, the Commission believed it, "could make the Institution more reflective of our nation… [as well as] address the problem of storing, curating, studying, and exhibiting the constantly growing collections."[6]

In 1996, during his second year as Secretary, Heyman observed several challenges facing the Institution.  Closely aligned with the announcements presented by the "Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution" in 1993, Heyman was faced with the challenges of dwindling storage for expanding collections, decreasing funds, and the need to reinforce the Smithsonian's identity as the nation's museum.  In addition, the Institution began to see increased interest from outside museums for partnerships and loans of artifacts that extended beyond standing practices.  Although collaborative agreements in the form of traveling exhibitions, joint exhibition sponsorship, and loans had been entered in the past by different Smithsonian museums, no infrastructure existed to provide institution-wide oversight and coordination of such partnerships. Heyman responded to these challenges by creating the Smithsonian Affiliations program to oversee and manage collections-based partnerships with other museums.  As stated by the minutes from the Smithsonian Board of Regents meeting housed in the Smithsonian Institution Archives, the program was formally approved by the Board of Regents on September 15, 1996.

Using the occasion of the Smithsonian Institution's 150th Anniversary, Smithsonian Affiliations was one of several outreach initiatives introduced by Heyman to expand the Institution's national reach.[7] In addition to the Affiliations program, the Institution became more accessible through its presence on the World Wide Web and through the largest traveling exhibition Smithsonian ever mounted, America's Smithsonian.[8] Secretary Heyman made formal announcements about the Affiliations program while delivering opening remarks for the Smithsonian's 150th Birthday Party on the Mall and in a number of cities for the opening of America's Smithsonian:

"The Smithsonian of the future must provide access to its collections and its vast resources.  There is no value in being just the largest if we do not share the Smithsonian with as many people as possible.  It means making sure those who cannot travel to Washington can somehow experience and enjoy the Smithsonian." – Secretary I. Michael Heyman[9]

At the end of the 1997 fiscal year, there were 21 organizations recognized as Affiliates.[10] As of 2017, there were over 200 Affiliates.[11]

Partner organizations are allowed to use the tag line "In Association with the Smithsonian Institution" and the approved Smithsonian Affiliations logo on their website, programming, and marketing material.[12][13] Any 501(c)(3) nonprofit or publicly operated educational entity can apply to become a Smithsonian Affiliate.[14]

Smithsonian Affiliations considers membership proposals from organizations that will advance the Smithsonian Institution's mission and strategic plan. Successful applicants are non-profit or publicly operated organizations whose missions are directed toward advancing research, knowledge, and education in science, history, and the arts. The guidelines of Smithsonian Affiliations establishes that the Smithsonian Institution maintain appropriate control over all collections loaned and that Affiliates cover all costs associated with borrowing and exhibiting objects.[15] To qualify as an Affiliate, an organization must prove that it is able to properly care for, protect, and exhibit Smithsonian collections on a long-term basis.  Strong applicants are organizations that are fiscally sound and capable of developing, installing, and evaluating professional exhibitions.

While serving as an Affiliate, organizations are required to grant Smithsonian Institution curators and personnel access to visit borrowed artifacts, provide the Smithsonian with reports and information necessary to monitor the state of the partnership, and uphold the integrity of the Board of Regents.[16][17]

To become an Affiliate, organizations submit an application package to Smithsonian Affiliations. Applicants provide documentation that confirms IRS status as a 501(c)(3) entity and a narrative detailing how the agreement will be mutually beneficial. Applications must also include a copy of the institution's mission statement, an organizational chart, an annual report, and a facilities report that follows the American Alliance of Museums format. Once approved, Affiliates sign a Smithsonian Affiliations Agreement and are assigned a National Outreach Manager to oversee loans and projects. All loan agreements are set for defined period of time.[18]

Affiliate organizations participate in a number of professional training, outreach, and programming initiatives coordinated by the Smithsonian Affiliations office.[19]

The Smithsonian Affiliations program supports, develops, and organizes a number of collaborative programs to promote education in science, art, history, and culture.

Affiliate organizations exchange ideas, professional research, and information about programming and exhibitions through a variety of activities including lecture, traveling exhibitions, workshops and reciprocal membership.

Affiliate organizations share research, exhibitions, and institutional updates through a variety of social media including the Smithsonian Affiliations website,[28] the Affiliate Blog,[29] the quarterly newsletter The Affiliate,[30] the electronic newsletter E-Affiliate,[31] YouTube, Flickr, Facebook and Twitter.

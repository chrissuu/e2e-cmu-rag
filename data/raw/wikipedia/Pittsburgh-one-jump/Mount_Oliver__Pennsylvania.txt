Mount Oliver is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,394 at the 2020 census.[4] It is a largely residential area situated atop a crest about 3 miles (5 km) west of the Monongahela River. The borough is surrounded entirely by the city of Pittsburgh, having resisted annexation attempts by the city.[5]

Mount Oliver was first settled by John Ormsby, an officer in the command of General Forbes, who was granted 249 acres of land along the banks of the Monongahela River. In 1788 Allegheny County was divided into townships, with Ormsby's plot being part of St. Clair Township. In 1800 Ormsby began selling parcels of land, while retaining rent and property taxes from residents. Ormsby named his growing settlement Mount Oliver, after his son, Oliver Ormsby. Later that year St. Clair Township would be divided with residents attempting to incorporate as a borough, however, the state ruled against the effort stating that the property owner quota was not sufficient to award incorporation, and Mount Oliver would become part of Lower St. Clair Township.[6]

In 1872 Pittsburgh began expanding southward, annexing the boroughs of South Pittsburgh, Monongahela, Allentown, Lawrenceville, Temperanceville, Birmingham, Mt. Washington, West Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Borough, East Birmingham, St. Clair Borough and Ormsby. Local residents began to feel threatened by this expansion, as well as feeling that Lower St. Clair Township was not properly dealing with their road improvements and public safety. As a result, in 1892 a petition circulated to incorporate Mount Oliver as a borough, which passed the courts on November 9, 1892.[6]

In 1927 Pittsburgh began another expansion effort, annexing the boroughs of Knoxville and Carrick, completely surrounding Mount Oliver. The city of Pittsburgh attempted to force annexation through a lengthy legal battle, however, the borough ultimately prevailed due to its population being too high to annex the municipality without a referendum approved by its residents.[6]

To this day residents of Mount Oliver fiercely defend their independence from Pittsburgh, seeing it as a point of local pride, which is helped by how approachable the local government is, and the rapid allocation of municipal services. However, there has been a noted decline from the 1980s, when the Borough was a local commercial hub.[7]

Turkey,[a] officially the Republic of Türkiye,[b] is a country mainly located in Anatolia in West Asia, with a relatively small part called East Thrace in Southeast Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq, Syria, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and the Aegean Sea, Greece, and Bulgaria to the west. Turkey is home to over 85 million people;[8] most are ethnic Turks, while Kurds are the largest ethnic minority.[5] Officially a secular state, Turkey has a Muslim-majority population. Ankara is Turkey's capital and second-largest city. Istanbul is its largest city and economic center. Other major cities include İzmir, Bursa, and Antalya.

First inhabited by modern humans during the Late Paleolithic,[13] present-day Turkey was home to various ancient peoples.[14] The Hattians were assimilated by the Hittites and other Anatolian peoples.[15] Classical Anatolia transitioned into cultural Hellenization after Alexander the Great's conquests, and later Romanization during the Roman and Byzantine eras.[16] The Seljuk Turks began migrating into Anatolia in the 11th century, starting the Turkification process.[17] The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into Turkish principalities.[18] Beginning in 1299, the Ottomans united the principalities and expanded. Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in 1453. During the reigns of Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power.[19] From 1789 onwards, the empire saw major changes, reforms, centralization, and rising nationalism while its territory declined.[20]

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction and in the Russian Empire resulted in large-scale loss of life and mass migration into modern-day Turkey from the Balkans, Caucasus, and Crimea.[21] Under the control of the Three Pashas, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian subjects.[22][23][24] Following Ottoman defeat, the Turkish War of Independence resulted in the abolition of the sultanate and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne. Turkey emerged as a more homogenous nation state.[25] The Republic was proclaimed on 29 October 1923, modelled on the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II, but was involved in the Korean War. Several military interventions interfered with the transition to a multi-party system.

Turkey is an upper-middle-income and emerging country; its economy is the world's 16th-largest by nominal and 12th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. As the 15th-largest electricity producer in the world, Turkey aims to become a hub for regional energy transportation. It is a unitary presidential republic. Turkey is a founding member of the OECD, G20, and Organization of Turkic States. With a geopolitically significant location, Turkey is a NATO member and has its second-largest military force. It may be recognized as an emerging, a middle, and a regional power. As an EU candidate, Turkey is part of the EU Customs Union.

Turkey has coastal plains, a high central plateau, and various mountain ranges with rising elevation eastwards. Turkey's climate is diverse, ranging from Mediterranean and other temperate climates to semi-arid and continental types. Home to three biodiversity hotspots, Turkey is prone to frequent earthquakes and is highly vulnerable to climate change.[26] Turkey has a universal healthcare system, growing access to education, and increasing levels of innovativeness.[27] It is a leading TV content exporter.[28] With numerous UNESCO World Heritage sites and intangible cultural heritage inscriptions, and a rich and diverse cuisine, Turkey is the fourth most visited country in the world.

Turchia, meaning "the land of the Turks", had begun to be used in European texts for Anatolia by the end of the 12th century.[29][30][31] As a word in Turkic languages, Turk may mean "strong, strength, ripe" or "flourishing, in full strength".[32] It may also mean ripe as in for a fruit or "in the prime of life, young, and vigorous" for a person.[33] As an ethnonym, the etymology is still unknown.[34] In addition to usage in languages such as Chinese in the 6th century,[31] the earliest mention of  Turk (𐱅𐰇𐰺𐰜, türü̲k̲; or 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰚, türk/tẄrk) in Turkic languages comes from the Second Turkic Khaganate.[35]

In Byzantine sources in the 10th century, the name Tourkia was used for defining two medieval states: Hungary (Western Tourkia); and Khazaria (Eastern Tourkia).[36][37] The Mamluk Sultanate, with its ruling elite of Turkic origin, was called the "State of the Turks" (Dawlat at-Turk, or Dawlat al-Atrāk, or Dawlat-at-Turkiyya).[38] Turkestan, also meaning the "land of the Turks", was used for a historic region in Central Asia.[39]

Middle English usage of Turkye or Turkeye is found in The Book of the Duchess (written in 1369–1372) to refer to Anatolia or the Ottoman Empire.[40] The modern spelling Turkey dates back to at least 1719.[41] The bird called turkey was named as such due to trade of guineafowl from Turkey to England.[31] The name Turkey has been used in international treaties referring to the Ottoman Empire.[42] With the Treaty of Alexandropol in 1920, the name Türkiye entered international documents for the first time. In the treaty signed with Afghanistan in 1921, the expression Devlet-i Âliyye-i Türkiyye ("Sublime Turkish State") was used, likened to the Ottoman Empire's name.[43]

In December 2021, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called for expanded official usage of Türkiye, saying that Türkiye "represents and expresses the culture, civilization, and values of the Turkish nation in the best way".[44] In May 2022, the Turkish government requested the United Nations and other international organizations to use Türkiye officially in English; the UN agreed.[45][46][47]

Present-day Turkey has been inhabited by modern humans since the late Paleolithic period and contains some of the world's oldest Neolithic sites.[49][50] Göbekli Tepe is close to 12,000 years old.[49] Parts of Anatolia include the Fertile Crescent, an origin of agriculture.[51] Other important Anatolian Neolithic sites include Çatalhöyük and Alaca Höyük.[52] Neolithic Anatolian farmers differed genetically from farmers in Iran and Jordan Valley.[53] These early Anatolian farmers also migrated into Europe, starting around 9,000 years ago.[53][54][55] Troy's earliest layers go back to around 4500 BC.[52]

Anatolia's historical records start with clay tablets from approximately around 2000 BC that were found in modern-day Kültepe.[56] These tablets belonged to an Assyrian trade colony.[56] The languages in Anatolia at that time included Hattian, Hurrian, Hittite, Luwian, and Palaic.[57] Hattian was a language indigenous to Anatolia, with no known modern-day connections.[57][58] Hurrian language was used in northern Syria.[57] Hittite, Palaic, and Luwian languages were "the oldest written Indo-European languages",[59] forming the Anatolian sub-group.[60][c]

Hattian rulers were gradually replaced by Hittite rulers.[56] The Hittite kingdom was a large kingdom in Central Anatolia, with its capital of Hattusa.[56] It co-existed in Anatolia with Palaians and Luwians, approximately between 1700 and 1200 BC.[56] As the Hittite kingdom was disintegrating, further waves of Indo-European peoples migrated from southeastern Europe, which was followed by warfare.[64] The Thracians were also present in modern-day Turkish Thrace.[65] It is not known if the Trojan War is based on historical events.[66] Troy's Late Bronze Age layers matches most with Iliad's story.[67]

Around 750 BC, Phrygia had been established, with its two centers in Gordium and modern-day Kayseri.[69] Phrygians spoke an Indo-European language, which was closer to Greek than Anatolian languages.[60] Phrygians shared Anatolia with Neo-Hittites and Urartu. Luwian-speakers were probably the majority in various Anatolian Neo-Hittite states.[70] Urartians spoke a non-Indo-European language and their capital was around Lake Van.[71][69] Urartu and Phrygia fell in seventh century BC.[69][72] They were replaced by Carians, Lycians and Lydians.[72] These three cultures "can be considered a reassertion of the ancient, indigenous culture of the Hattian cities of Anatolia".[72]

Before 1200 BC, there were four Greek-speaking settlements in Anatolia, including Miletus.[73] Around 1000 BC, Greeks started migrating to the west coast of Anatolia. These eastern Greek settlements played a vital role in shaping the Archaic Greek civilization;[69][74] important cities included Miletus, Ephesus, Halicarnassus, Smyrna (now İzmir) and Byzantium (now Istanbul), the latter founded by colonists from Megara in the seventh century BCE.[75] These settlements were grouped as Aeolis, Ionia, and Doris, after the specific Greek groups that settled them.[76][77] Further Greek colonization in Anatolia was led by Miletus and Megara in 750–480 BC.[78] The Greek cities along the Aegean prospered with trade, and saw remarkable scientific and scholarly accomplishments.[79] Thales and Anaximander from Miletus founded the Ionian School of philosophy, thereby laying the foundations of rationalism and Western philosophy.[80]

Cyrus attacked eastern Anatolia in 547 BC, and Achaemenid Empire eventually expanded into western Anatolia.[72] In the east, the Armenian province was part of the Achaemenid Empire.[69] Following the Greco-Persian Wars, the Greek city-states of the Anatolian Aegean coast regained independence, but most of the interior stayed part of the Achaemenid Empire.[72] Two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, were located in Anatolia.[82]

Following the victories of Alexander in 334 BC and 333 BC, the Achaemenid Empire collapsed and Anatolia became part of the Macedonian Empire.[72] This led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization of the Anatolian interior,[83][84][85] which met resistance in some places.[86] Following Alexander's death, the Seleucids ruled large parts of Anatolia, while native Anatolian states emerged in the Marmara and Black Sea areas. In eastern Anatolia, the kingdom of Armenia appeared. In third century BC, Celts invaded central Anatolia and continued as a major ethnic group in the area for around 200 years. They were known as the Galatians.[87]

When Pergamon requested assistance in its conflict with the Seleucids, Rome intervened in Anatolia in the second century BC. Without an heir, Pergamum's king left the kingdom to Rome, which was annexed as province of Asia. Roman influence grew in Anatolia afterwards.[88] Following Asiatic Vespers massacre, and Mithridatic Wars with Pontus, Rome emerged victorious. Around the 1st century BC, Rome expanded into parts of Pontus and Bithynia, while turning rest of Anatolian states into Roman satellites.[89] Several conflicts with Parthians ensued, with peace and wars alternating.[90]

According to Acts of the Apostles, early Christian Church had significant growth in Anatolia because of St Paul's efforts. Letters from St. Paul in Anatolia comprise the oldest Christian literature.[91] Under Roman authority, ecumenical councils such as Council of Nicaea (Iznik) in 325 served as a guide for developing "orthodox expressions of basic Christian teachings".[91]

The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire centered in Constantinople during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The eastern half of the Empire survived the conditions that caused the fall of the West in the 5th century AD, and continued to exist until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in the Mediterranean world. The term Byzantine Empire was only coined following the empire's demise; its citizens referred to the polity as the "Roman Empire" and to themselves as Romans. Due to the imperial seat's move from Rome to Byzantium, the adoption of Christianity as the state religion, and the predominance of Greek instead of Latin, modern historians continue to make a distinction between the earlier Roman Empire and the later Byzantine Empire.[citation needed]

In the early Byzantine Empire period, the Anatolian coastal areas were Greek speaking. In addition to natives, interior Anatolia had diverse groups such as Goths, Celts, Persians and Jews. Interior Anatolia had been "heavily Hellenized".[93] Anatolian languages eventually became extinct after Hellenization of Anatolia.[94]

According to historians and linguists, the Proto-Turkic language originated in Central-East Asia.[95] Initially, Proto-Turkic speakers were potentially both hunter-gatherers and farmers; they later became nomadic pastoralists.[96] Early and medieval Turkic groups exhibited a wide range of both East Asian and West-Eurasian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring peoples such as Iranic, Mongolic, Tocharian, Uralic, and Yeniseian peoples.[97] During the 9th and 10th centuries CE, the Oghuz were a Turkic group that lived in the Caspian and Aral steppes.[98] Partly due to pressure from the Kipchaks, the Oghuz migrated into Iran and Transoxiana.[98] They mixed with Iranic-speaking groups in the area and converted to Islam.[98] Oghuz Turks were also known as Turkmen or Turkoman.[99][98]

The ruling family of the Seljuks originated from the Kınık branch of the Oghuz Turks.[100] In 1040, the Seljuks defeated the Ghaznavids at the Battle of Dandanaqan and established the Seljuk Empire in Greater Khorasan.[101] Baghdad, the Abbasid Caliphate's capital and center of the Islamic world, was taken by Seljuks in 1055.[99] Given the role Khurasani traditions played in art, culture, and political traditions in the empire, the Seljuk period is described as a mixture of "Turkish, Persian and Islamic influences".[102] In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into medieval Armenia and Anatolia.[99] At the time, Anatolia was a diverse and largely Greek-speaking region after previously being Hellenized.[103][104][93]

The Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and later established the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum.[105] During this period, there were also Turkish principalities such as Danishmendids.[106] Seljuk arrival started the Turkification process in Anatolia;[104][65] there were Turkic/Turkish migrations, intermarriages, and conversions into Islam.[107][108] The shift took several centuries and happened gradually.[109][110] Members of Islamic mysticism orders, such as Mevlevi Order, played a role in the Islamization of the diverse people of Anatolia.[111][112] Seljuk expansion was one of the reasons for the Crusades.[113] In 13th century, there was a second significant wave of Turkic migration, as people fled Mongol expansion.[114][115] Seljuk sultanate was defeated by the Mongols at the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243 and disappeared by the beginning of the 14th century. It was replaced by various Turkish principalities.[18][116]

Based around Söğüt, Ottoman Beylik was founded by Osman I in the early 14th century.[117] According to Ottoman chroniclers, Osman descended from the Kayı tribe of the Oghuz Turks.[118] Ottomans started annexing the nearby Turkish beyliks (principalities) in Anatolia and expanded into the Balkans.[119] Mehmed II completed Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, Constantinople, on 29 May 1453.[120] Selim I united Anatolia under Ottoman rule.[121] Turkification continued as Ottomans mixed with various indigenous people in Anatolia and the Balkans.[118]

The Ottoman Empire was a global power during the reigns of Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent.[121][122] In the 16th and 17th centuries, Sephardic Jews moved into Ottoman Empire following their expulsion from Spain.[123] From the second half of the 18th century onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to decline. The Tanzimat reforms, initiated by Mahmud II in 1839, aimed to modernize the Ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in Western Europe. The Ottoman constitution of 1876 was the first among Muslim states, but was short-lived.[124][125]

As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth; especially after the Ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875[128] which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples, leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the Hamidian massacres of Armenians, which claimed up to 300,000 lives.[129][better source needed] Ottoman territories in Europe (Rumelia) were lost in the First Balkan War (1912–1913).[130] Ottomans managed to recover some territory in Europe, such as Edirne, in the Second Balkan War (1913).

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction and in the Russian Empire resulted in estimated 5 million deaths,[131][132] with the casualties including Turks.[132] Five to seven or seven to nine million refugees migrated into modern-day Turkey from the Balkans, Caucasus, Crimea, and Mediterranean islands,[133] shifting the center of the Ottoman Empire to Anatolia.[134] In addition to a small number of Jews, the refugees were overwhelmingly Muslim; they were both Turkish and non-Turkish people, such as Circassians and Crimean Tatars.[135][136] Paul Mojzes has called the Balkan Wars an "unrecognized genocide", where multiple sides were both victims and perpetrators.[137] Circassian refugees included the survivors of the Circassian genocide.[138]

Following the 1913 coup d'état, the Three Pashas took control of the Ottoman government. The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated.[139] During the war, the empire's Armenian subjects were deported to Syria as part of the Armenian genocide. As a result, an estimated 600,000[140] to more than 1 million,[140] or up to 1.5 million[141][142][143] Armenians were killed. The Turkish government has refused to acknowledge[144][145] the events as genocide and states that Armenians were only "relocated" from the eastern war zone.[146] Genocidal campaigns were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the Assyrians and Greeks.[147][148][149] Following the Armistice of Mudros in 1918, the victorious Allied Powers sought the partition of the Ottoman Empire through the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres.[150]

The occupation of Istanbul (1918) and İzmir (1919) by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I initiated the Turkish National Movement. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Pasha, a military commander who had distinguished himself during the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1923) was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres (1920).[151]

The Turkish Provisional Government in Ankara, which had declared itself the legitimate government of the country on 23 April 1920, started to formalize the legal transition from the old Ottoman into the new Republican political system. The Ankara Government engaged in armed and diplomatic struggle. In 1921–1923, the Armenian, Greek, French, and British armies had been expelled.[152][153][154][155] The military advance and diplomatic success of the Ankara Government resulted in the signing of the Armistice of Mudanya on 11 October 1922. On 1 November 1922, the Turkish Parliament in Ankara formally abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of monarchical Ottoman rule.

The Treaty of Lausanne of 24 July 1923, which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres,[150][151] led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the new Turkish state as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire. On 4 October 1923, the Allied occupation of Turkey ended with the withdrawal of the last Allied troops from Istanbul. The Turkish Republic was officially proclaimed on 29 October 1923 in Ankara, the country's new capital.[156] The Lausanne Convention stipulated a population exchange between Greece and Turkey.[157]

Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first president and introduced many reforms. The reforms aimed to transform the old religion-based and multi-communal Ottoman monarchy into a Turkish nation state that would be governed as a parliamentary republic under a secular constitution.[158] Women gained the right to vote nationally in 1934.[159] With the Surname Law, the Turkish Parliament bestowed upon Kemal the honorific surname "Atatürk" (Father Turk).[151] Atatürk's reforms caused discontent in some Kurdish and Zaza tribes leading to the Sheikh Said rebellion in 1925[160] and the Dersim rebellion in 1937.[161]

İsmet İnönü became the country's second president following Atatürk's death in 1938. In 1939, the Republic of Hatay voted in favor of joining Turkey with a referendum. Turkey remained neutral during almost all of World War II,[162] but entered the war on the side of the Allies on 23 February 1945.[163] Later that year, Turkey became a charter member of the United Nations.[164] In 1950 Turkey became a member of the Council of Europe. After fighting as part of the UN forces in the Korean War, Turkey joined NATO in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean.

Military coups or memorandums, which happened in 1960, 1971, 1980, and 1997, complicated Turkey's transition to a democratic multiparty system.[165][166] Between 1960 and the end of the 20th century, the prominent leaders in Turkish politics who achieved multiple election victories were Süleyman Demirel, Bülent Ecevit and Turgut Özal.[citation needed] PKK started a "campaign of terrorist attacks on civilian and military targets" in the 1980s.[167] It is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey,[168] the United States,[169] and the European Union.[170] Tansu Çiller became the first female prime minister of Turkey in 1993. Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987, joined the European Union Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005.[171][172] Customs Union had an important impact on the Turkish manufacturing sector.[173][174]

In 2014, prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won Turkey's first direct presidential election.[175] On 15 July 2016, an unsuccessful coup attempt tried to oust the government.[176] According to the Turkish government, there are 13,251 arrested or convicted people in jail as of 2024, related to the 2016 coup attempt.[177][178] With a referendum in 2017, the parliamentary republic was replaced by an executive presidential system. The office of the prime minister was abolished, and its powers and duties were transferred to the president. On the referendum day, while the voting was still underway, the Supreme Electoral Council lifted a rule that required each ballot to have an official stamp.[179] The opposition parties claimed that as many as 2.5 million ballots without a stamp were accepted as valid.[179] In 2025 the PKK declared a ceasefire.[180]

Turkey is a unitary state. Its administrative system includes central and local administration. Central administration consists of the central government in Ankara, and local departments such as 81 provinces and their subdivisions. Local administration authorities consist of metropolitan municipalities, municipalities, neighborhoods or villages, and special provincial administrations. For economic and geographic reasons, Turkey is also categorized into seven regions and 21 sub-regions.[181]

Turkey is a presidential republic within a multi-party system.[182] The current constitution was adopted in 1982.[125] In the Turkish unitary system, citizens are subject to three levels of government: national, provincial, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between municipal governments and districts, in which the executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district.[citation needed] The government comprises three branches: first is the legislative branch, which is Grand National Assembly of Turkey;[183] second is the executive branch, which is the President of Turkey;[184] and third is the judicial branch, which includes the Constitutional Court, 
the Court of Cassation and Court of Jurisdictional Disputes.[185][6]

The Parliament has 600 seats, distributed among the provinces proportionally to the population. The Parliament and the president serve a five-year terms, with elections on the same day. The president is elected by direct vote and cannot run for re-election after two terms, unless the parliament calls early presidential elections during the second term.[citation needed] The Constitutional Court is composed of 15 members, elected for single 12-year terms. They are obliged to retire when they are over the age of 65.[186] Turkish politics have become increasingly associated with democratic backsliding, being described as a competitive authoritarian system.[187][188]

Elections in Turkey are held for six functions of government: presidential (national), parliamentary (national), municipality mayors (local), district mayors (local), provincial or municipal council members (local), and muhtars (local). Referendums are also held occasionally. Every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 has the right to vote and stand as a candidate at elections.[citation needed] Universal suffrage for both sexes has been applied throughout Turkey since 1934.[189] In Turkey, turnout rates of both local and general elections are high compared to many other countries, which usually stands higher than 80%.[citation needed] President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is currently serving as the head of state and head of government.[190][191] Özgür Özel is the Main Opposition Leader. The last parliamentary and presidential elections were in 2023.

The Constitutional Court can strip the public financing of political parties that it deems anti-secular or having ties to terrorism, or ban their existence altogether.[192][193] The electoral threshold for political parties at national level is seven percent of the votes.[194] Smaller parties can avoid the electoral threshold by forming an alliance with other parties. Independent candidates are not subject to an electoral threshold.

On the right side of the Turkish political spectrum, parties like the Democrat Party, Justice Party, Motherland Party, and Justice and Development Party became the most popular political parties in Turkey, winning numerous elections. Turkish right-wing parties are more likely to embrace the principles of political ideologies such as conservatism, nationalism or Islamism.[195] On the left side of the spectrum, parties like the Republican People's Party, Social Democratic Populist Party and Democratic Left Party once enjoyed the largest electoral success. Left-wing parties are more likely to embrace the principles of socialism, Kemalism or secularism.[196]

With the founding of the Republic, Turkey adopted a civil law legal system, replacing Sharia-derived Ottoman law. The Civil Code, adopted in 1926, was based on the Swiss Civil Code of 1907 and the Swiss Code of Obligations of 1911. Although it underwent a number of changes in 2002, it retains much of the basis of the original Code. The Criminal Code, originally based on the Italian Criminal Code, was replaced in 2005 by a Code with principles similar to the German Penal Code and German law generally. Administrative law is based on the French equivalent and procedural law generally shows the influence of the Swiss, German and French legal systems.[197] Islamic principles do not play a part in the legal system.[198]

Law enforcement in Turkey is carried out by several agencies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. These agencies are the General Directorate of Security, the Gendarmerie General Command and the Coast Guard Command.[199] In the years of government by the Justice and Development Party and Erdoğan, particularly since 2013, the independence and integrity of the Turkish judiciary has increasingly been said to be in doubt by institutions, parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside of Turkey, because of political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors and in their pursuit of public duty.[200][201][202]

Turkey has been characterized as an emerging[203] or rising,[204] a middle,[205] a quasi-regional,[206] and a regional power.[207][208] Turkey's constant foreign policy goal is to pursue its national interests. These interests are mainly growing the economy, and maintaining security from internal terrorist and external threats.[209] After the establishment of the Republic, Atatürk and İnönü followed the "peace at home, peace in the world" principle until the Cold War's start.[210] Following threats from the Soviet Union, Turkey sought to ally with the United States and joined NATO in 1952.[211][210]

Overall, Turkey aims for good relations with Central Asia, the Caucasus, Russia, the Middle East, and Iran. With the West, Turkey also aims to keep its arrangements.[212] By trading with the east and joining the EU, Turkey pursues economic growth.[212] Turkey joined the European Union Customs Union in 1995,[213] but its EU accession talks are frozen as of 2024.[214]

Turkey has sought closer relations with the Central Asian Turkic states after the breakup of the Soviet Union.[215] Closer relations with Azerbaijan, a culturally close country, was achieved.[215] Turkey is a founding member of the International Organization of Turkic Culture and Organization of Turkic States.[216][217] It is also a member of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Council of Europe, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.[218]

Following the Arab Spring, Turkey had problems with countries such as United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.[219] Relations with these countries have improved since then.[219][220][221] There are disputes with Greece over maritime boundaries and with Cyprus.[222] In 2018, the Turkish military and the Turkish-backed forces began an operation in Syria aimed at ousting US-backed YPG (which Turkey considers to be an offshoot of the outlawed PKK)[223][224] from the enclave of Afrin.[225][226] Turkey has also conducted airstrikes in Iraqi Kurdistan, which was criticized by Iraq for violating its sovereignty and killing civilians.[227] Diplomatic relations with Israel were damaged after the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid,[228] normalized in 2016,[229] and cut again following the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip.[230] In 2024, Turkey stopped trading with Israel.[230]

The Turkish Armed Forces are responsible for defense against foreign threats. While the Commander-in-Chief is the President, General Staff, Air Force, Naval Force, and Land Force usually report to the Minister of National Defence.[234] The Gendarmerie General Command and the Coast Guard Command are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior.[235] Military service is required for 6–12 months for men,[236] which is reduced to one month after paying a fee.[237] Turkey does not recognize conscientious objection and does not offer a civilian alternative to military service.[238]

Turkey has the second-largest military force in NATO, after the United States, with an estimated strength of 890,700 military personnel as of February 2022.[239] Turkey is considered a significant power in unmanned aerial vehicles.[240] As part of the nuclear sharing policy of NATO, Turkey hosts approximately 20 United States B61 nuclear bombs at the Incirlik Air Base.[241][242] In recent years, Turkey's defense industry has developed rapidly.[243] Aselsan, Turkish Aerospace Industries, Roketsan, and ASFAT are among the top 100 defense companies in the world.[244]

Turkey has participated in international missions under the United Nations and NATO since the Korean War, including peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Yugoslavia and the Horn of Africa. It supported coalition forces in the First Gulf War, contributed military personnel to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, and remains active in Kosovo Force, Eurocorps and EU Battlegroups.[245][246] As of 2016, Turkey has assisted Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq and the Somali Armed Forces with security and training.[247][248] The Turkish Armed Forces have a relatively substantial military presence abroad,[249] with military bases in Albania,[250] Iraq,[251] Qatar,[252] and Somalia.[253] The country also maintains a force of 36,000 troops in Northern Cyprus since 1974.[254]

Article two of the Turkish Constitution includes references to upholding the rule of law and human rights.[256] In the 2000s, legal changes were made for public use of and teaching in the Kurdish language. This included opening a Kurdish-language national TV channel. Various "openings" were made to address concerns of minorities such as Alevi, ethnic Kurds, and ethnic Romani people.[257] Sentences for violence against women were strengthened.[257]

In 2013, widespread protests erupted, sparked by a plan to demolish Gezi Park but soon growing into general anti-government dissent.[258] On 20 May 2016, the Turkish parliament stripped almost a quarter of its members of immunity from prosecution, including 101 deputies from the pro-Kurdish HDP and the main opposition CHP party.[259][260] According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are 13 jailed journalists in Turkey.[261]  In its 2023 report, the European Commission criticized how democratic institutions in Turkey operate.[262] The criticism was rejected by Turkey.[263] As of 2023, Turkey was the country with the highest number of European Court of Human Rights cases.[264]

Prior to 1858, Ottoman Empire had "a lenient legal accommodation of same-sex intimacy". When prosecuted, the punishment was monetary fines. In 1858, the 1810 French Penal Code was adopted by the Ottomans, which had no penalties for same-sex intimacy that is private.[266] Under the Republic, same sex acts have never been criminalized.[267] However, LGBT people in Turkey face discrimination, harassment and even violence.[268] In a survey conducted in 2016, 33% of respondents said that LGBT people should have equal rights, which increased to 45% in 2020. Another survey in 2018 found that the proportion of people who would not want a homosexual neighbor decreased from 55% in 2018 to 47% in 2019.[269][270]

When the annual Istanbul Pride was inaugurated in 2003, Turkey became the first Muslim-majority country to hold a gay pride march.[271] Since 2015, parades at Taksim Square and İstiklal Avenue have been denied government permission, citing security concerns, but hundreds of people have defied the ban each year.[265] The bans were criticized.[265]

Turkey covers an area of 783,562 square kilometres (302,535 square miles).[272] With Turkish straits and Sea of Marmara in between, Turkey bridges Western Asia and Southeastern Europe.[273] Turkey's Asian side covers 97% of its surface, and is often called Anatolia.[274] Another definition of Anatolia's eastern boundary is an imprecise line from the Black Sea to Gulf of Iskenderun.[275] Eastern Thrace, Turkey's European side, includes around 10% of the population and covers 3% of the surface area.[276] The country is encircled by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.[277] Turkey is bordered by Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Iran to the east.[277] To the south, it's bordered by Syria and Iraq.[278] To the north, its Thracian area is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria.[277]

Turkey is divided into "seven major regions": Marmara, Aegean, Central Anatolia, Black Sea,  Eastern Anatolia, Southeastern Anatolia and the Mediterranean.[277] As a general trend, the inland Anatolian Plateau becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.[279] Mountain ranges include Köroğlu and Pontic mountain ranges to the north, and the Taurus Mountains to the south. The Lakes Region contains some of the largest lakes in Turkey such as Lake Beyşehir and Lake Eğirdir.

Geographers have used the eastern Anatolian plateau, Iranian plateau, and Armenian plateau terms to refer to the mountainous area around where Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates merge. The eastern Anatolian plateau and Armenian plateau definitions largely overlap.[281] The Eastern Anatolia Region contains Mount Ararat, Turkey's highest point at 5,137 metres (16,854 feet),[282] and Lake Van, the largest lake in the country.[283] Eastern Turkey is home to the sources of rivers such as the Euphrates, Tigris and Aras. The Southeastern Anatolia Region includes the northern plains of Upper Mesopotamia.

Earthquakes happen frequently in Turkey.[284] Almost the entire population lives in areas with varying seismic risk levels, with around 70% in highest or second-highest seismic areas.[285][286] Anatolian plate is bordered by North Anatolian Fault zone to the north; East Anatolian Fault zone and Bitlis–Zagros collision zone to the east; Hellenic and Cyprus subduction zones to the south; and Aegean extensional zone to the west.[287] After 1999 İzmit and 1999 Düzce earthquakes, North Anatolian Fault zone activity "is considered to be one of the most dangerous natural hazards in Turkey".[288] 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes were the deadliest in contemporary Turkish history.[289] Turkey is sometimes unfavorably compared to Chile, a country with a similar developmental level that is more successful with earthquake preparedness.[290][291][292]

Turkey has rich biodiversity,[298][299][293] and includes three biodiversity hotspots[299][293] out of the 36 in the world.[293] These are the Mediterranean, Irano-Anatolian, and Caucasus hotspots.[293] Central or Eastern Anatolian steppe ecosystems contain wild animal and plant species whose genetic variation have important implications for the food industry, agriculture, and medicine. Other ecosystems in Turkey include Mediterranean plant types, temperate deciduous forest, and Alpine tundra.[300] An extensive number of species of plants and animals exist in Turkey.[300]  These include around 197 mammal species, 420 bird species, 820 marine and freshwater fish species, 130 reptile species, and 10,150 vascular plant species.[301] Some of these are endangered or critically endangered.[300] A lot of the animal and plant species are endemic.[293]

Landscapes in Turkey face a variety of threats and risks such as desertification, soil erosion, declining groundwater levels, and salinization of soil. 27% of Turkey is protected, which includes conservation areas, forests, national parks, biosphere reserves, natural monuments,  and historical sites.[302] There are 50 national parks;[303] most visited in 2022 were Marmaris National Park and Beydağları Coastal National Park.[304] As of 2020, Turkey's forests covered 29% of Turkey's surface area.[305] Turkey's forests include globally largest concentrations of Cedrus libani and Mediterranean cypress trees, while Turkey's wetlands are significant for migratory birds.[300]

There is a large variation in Turkey's climate due to the rising overall elevation eastwards and the mountains that run alongside the coasts.[273] Some of the characteristics of Turkey's climate include warm to hot summers with milder winter temperatures compared to other middle-latitude areas,[dubious – discuss] intense sunlight in summer,[dubious – discuss] winters having around half of the annual precipitation,[dubious – discuss] and the influence of the Black and Mediterranean Seas.[307] Exceptions to the milder climate are some of the interior and eastern parts of Turkey,[307] which have cold winters and hot summers.[308]

There are several major climate types in Turkey under the Köppen climate classification. Mediterranean climate is found in the Mediterranean, Aegean, Marmara, and Southeastern Antolia regions. In the Black Sea area, humid subtropical climate or oceanic climate are usually found. Parts of Central Anatolia and Eastern Anatolia include semi-arid climate and continental climate types.[310]

Turkey is highly vulnerable to climate change,[311][312] due to socioeconomic, climatic, and geographic factors.[311] This applies to nine out of ten climate vulnerability dimensions, such as "average annual risk to wellbeing".[311] OECD median is two out of ten.[311] Inclusive and swift growth is needed for decreasing vulnerability.[313] Turkey aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2053.[314][315] Accomplishing climate goals would require large investments, but would also result in net economic benefits, broadly due to reduced imports of fuel and due to better health from lowering air pollution.[316]

Turkey is an upper-middle-income country and an emerging market.[286][319] A founding member of the OECD and G20, it has the 16th-largest economy by nominal and 12th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP in the world.[320] It is classified among newly industrialized countries. The service sector accounts for 61% of the economy, whereas industry accounts for 32% and agriculture contributes about 7%.[321] According to IMF estimates, Turkey's GDP per capita by PPP is $42,451 in 2025, while its nominal GDP per capita is $16,709.[320] Foreign direct investment in Turkey peaked at $22.05 billion in 2007 and dropped to $13.09 billion in 2022.[322] Potential growth is weakened by long-lasting structural and macro obstacles, such as slow rates of productivity growth and high inflation.[286]

Turkey has a diversified economy; main industries include automobiles, electronics, textiles, construction, steel, mining, and food processing.[323] Machinery and manufacturing lead among products in Turkey's merchandise exports.[324] Turkey is a major agricultural producer.[325] It ranks 8th in crude steel production, and 13th in motor vehicle production, ship building (by tonnage), and annual industrial robot installation in the world.[326] Turkish automative companies include TEMSA, Otokar, BMC and Togg. Togg is the first all-electric vehicle company of Turkey. Arçelik, Vestel, and Beko are major manufacturers of consumer electronics.[327] Arçelik is one of the largest producers of household goods in the world.[328]  In 2022, Turkey ranked second in the world in terms of the number of international contractors in the top 250 list.[329] It is also the fifth largest in the world in terms of textile exports.[330]

Turkey's services exports are mostly transport and tourism.[332] Tourism accounts for about 8% of Turkey's GDP.[333] In 2024, Turkey ranked fourth  in the world in the number of international tourist arrivals with 60.6 million foreign tourists.[334] Turkey has 22 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and 84 World Heritage Sites in tentative list. Turkey is home to 625 Blue Flag beaches, third most in the world.[335] In 2024, Euromonitor International ranked Istanbul and Antalya among the top ten most visited cities in the world.[336] Turkish Airlines is one of the largest airlines in the world.

Between 2007 and 2021, the share of population below the PPP-$6.85 per day international poverty threshold declined from 20% to 7.6%.[286] In 2023, 13.9% of the population was below the national at-risk-of-poverty rate.[337] In 2021, 34% of the population were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, using Eurostat definition.[338] Unemployment in Turkey was 10.4% in 2022.[339] In 2021, it was estimated that 47% of total disposable income was received by the top 20% of income earners, while the lowest 20% received only 6%.[340] Compared to the OECD average, labor force participation of women is lower. Affordable childcare and better parental leave policies are needed to lift women's employment.[315]

Turkey is the 15th-largest electricity and 13th-largest renewable electricity producer in the world. Turkey's energy generation capacity increased significantly, with electricity generation from renewable sources tripling in the past decade.[342][343] It produced 43.8% of its electricity from such sources in 2019.[344] Turkey is also the fourth-largest producer of geothermal power in the world.[345] Turkey's first nuclear power station, Akkuyu, will increase diversification of its energy mix.[346] When it comes to total final consumption, fossil fuels still play a large role, accounting for 73%.[347] A major reason of Turkey's greenhouse gas emissions is the large proportion of coal in the energy system.[348] As of 2017, while the government had invested in low carbon energy transition, fossil fuels were still subsidized.[349] By 2053, Turkey aims to have net zero emissions.[314][315]

Turkey has made security of its energy supply a top priority, given its heavy reliance on gas and oil imports.[346] Turkey's main energy supply sources are Russia, West Asia, and Central Asia.[212] Gas production began in 2023 in the recently discovered Sakarya gas field. When fully operational, it will supply about 30% of the natural gas needed domestically.[350][351] Turkey aims to become a hub for regional energy transportation.[352] Several oil and gas pipelines span the country, including the Blue Stream, TurkStream, and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipelines.[352]

As of 2023, Turkey has 3,726 kilometers of controlled-access highways and 29,373 kilometers of divided highways.[353] Multiple bridges and tunnels connect Asian and European sides of Turkey; the Çanakkale 1915 Bridge on the Dardanelles strait is the longest suspension bridge in the world.[354] Marmaray and Eurasia tunnels under the Bosporus connect both sides of Istanbul.[355] The Osman Gazi Bridge connects the northern and southern shores of the Gulf of İzmit.

Turkish State Railways operates both conventional and high speed trains, with the government expanding both.[356] High-speed rail lines include the Ankara-Istanbul, Ankara-Konya, and Ankara-Sivas routes.[357] Istanbul Metro is the largest subway network in the country with around 704 million annual ridership in 2019.[358] There are 115 airports as of 2024.[359] Istanbul Airport is one of the top 10 busiest airports in the world. Turkey aims to become a transportation hub.[360][361] It is part of various routes that connect Asia and Europe, including the Middle Corridor.[361] In 2024, Turkey, Iraq, UAE, and Qatar signed an agreement to link Iraqi port facilities to Turkey via road and rail connections.[362]

Turkey's spending on research and development as a share of GDP has risen from 0.47% in 2000 to 1.40% in 2023,[363] although it is still around half of the average for the OECD.[364] Turkey ranks 16th in the world in terms of article output in scientific and technical journals, and 35th in Nature Index.[365][366] Turkish patent office ranks 21st worldwide in overall patent applications, and 3rd in industrial design applications. Vast majority of applicants to the Turkish patent office are Turkish residents. In all patent offices globally, Turkish residents rank 21st for overall patent applications.[367] In 2024, Turkey ranked 37th in the world and 3rd among its upper-middle income group in the Global Innovation Index.[368] Istanbul and Ankara rank among the top 100 science and technology clusters in the world.[369] TÜBİTAK is one of the main agencies for funding and carrying out research.[370][371][372]

Although Turkey needs more national innovation,[373] it is improving in areas such as high technology and defense.[364] To boost the output of high-value-added products, Turkey launched its National Technology Initiative in 2019.[374] In line with its research priorities, Turkey developed roadmaps in various areas such as advanced materials, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, internet of things, nanoelectronics, robotics, and quantum technology.[371] Some of the main science and technology programs include the National Research Program, Industry and Technology Strategy, Climate Change Strategy, National Artificial Intelligence Strategy, and National Space Program.[371] In 2024 and 2025, Turkey's first electron accelerator,[375] quantum computer,[376] and communication satellite manufactured domestically became operational.[377]

According to the Address-Based Population Recording System, the country's population was 85,372,377 in 2023, excluding Syrians under temporary protection.[8] 93% lived in province and district centers.[8] People within the 15–64 and 0–14 age groups corresponded to 68.3% and 21.4% of the total population, respectively. Those aged 65 years or older made up 10.2%.[8] Between 1950 and 2020, Turkey's population more than quadrupled from 20.9 million to 83.6 million;[379] however, the population growth rate was 0.1% in 2023.[8] In 2023, the total fertility rate was 1.51 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.10 per woman.[380] In a 2018 health survey, the ideal children number was 2.8 children per woman, rising to 3 per married woman.[381]

Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a Turk as anyone who is a citizen.[383] It is estimated that there are at least 47 ethnic groups represented in Turkey.[384] Reliable data on the ethnic mix of the population is not available because census figures do not include statistics on ethnicity after the 1965 Turkish census.[385] According to the World Factbook, 70–75% of the country's citizens are ethnic Turks.[5] Based on a survey, KONDA's estimation was 76% in 2006, with 78% of adult citizens self-identifying their ethnic background as Turk.[386] In 2021, 77% of adult citizens identified as such in a survey.[387]

Kurds are the largest ethnic minority.[388] Their exact numbers remain disputed,[388] with estimates ranging from 12 to 20% of the population.[389] The Kurds make up a majority in the provinces of Ağrı, Batman, Bingöl, Bitlis, Diyarbakır, Hakkari, Iğdır, Mardin, Muş, Siirt, Şırnak, Tunceli and Van; a near majority in Şanlıurfa (47%); and a large minority in Kars (20%).[390] In addition, internal migration has resulted in Kurdish diaspora communities in all of the major cities in central and western Turkey. In Istanbul, there are an estimated three million Kurds, making it the city with the largest Kurdish population in the world.[391] 19% of adult citizens identified as ethnic Kurds in a survey in 2021.[387] Some people have multiple ethnic identities, such as both Turk and Kurd.[392][393] In 2006, an estimated 2.7 million ethnic Turks and Kurds were related from interethnic marriages.[394]

According to the World Factbook, non-Kurdish ethnic minorities are 7–12% of the population.[5] In 2006, KONDA estimated that non-Kurdish and non-Zaza ethnic minorities constituted 8.2% of the population; these were people who gave general descriptions such as Turkish citizen, people with other Turkic backgrounds, Arabs, and others.[386] In 2021, 4% of adult citizens identified as non-ethnic Turk or non-ethnic Kurd in a survey.[387] According to the Constitutional Court, there are only four officially recognized minorities in Turkey: the three non-Muslim minorities recognized in the Treaty of Lausanne (Armenians, Greeks, and Jews[d]) and the Bulgarians.[e][398][399][400] In 2013, the Ankara 13th Circuit Administrative Court ruled that the minority provisions of the Lausanne Treaty should also apply to Assyrians in Turkey and the Syriac language.[401][402][403] Other unrecognized ethnic groups include Albanians, Bosniaks, Circassians, Georgians, Laz, Pomaks, and Roma.[404][405][406]

The official language is Turkish, which is the most widely spoken Turkic language in the world.[407][408] It is spoken by 85%[409][410] to 90%[411] of the population as a first language. Kurdish speakers are the largest linguistic minority.[411] A survey estimated 13% of the population speak Kurdish or Zaza as a first language.[409] Other minority languages include Arabic, Caucasian languages, and Gagauz.[411] The linguistic rights of the officially recognized minorities are de jure recognized and protected for Armenian, Bulgarian, Greek, Hebrew,[f][395][398][399][400] and Syriac.[402][403] There are multiple endangered languages in Turkey.

Excluding Syrians under temporary protection, there were 1,570,543 foreign citizens in Turkey in 2023.[8] Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Turkey and the Kurdish areas of Iran during the Gulf War in 1991. Turkey's migrant crisis in the 2010s and early 2020s resulted in the influx of millions of refugees and immigrants.[412] Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees in the world as of April 2020.[413] The Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency manages the refugee crisis in Turkey. Before the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the estimated number of Arabs in Turkey varied from 1 million to more than 2 million.[414]

In November 2020, there were 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey;[415] these included other ethnic groups of Syria, such as Syrian Kurds[416] and Syrian Turkmens.[417] As of August 2023, the number of these refugees was estimated to be 3.3 million. The number of Syrians had decreased by about 200,000 people since the beginning of the year.[418] The government has granted citizenship to 238 thousand Syrians by November 2023.[419] As of May 2023, approximately 96,000 Ukrainian refugees of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine have sought refuge in Turkey.[420] In 2022, nearly 100,000 Russian citizens migrated to Turkey, becoming the first in the list of foreigners who moved to Turkey, meaning an increase of more than 218% from 2021.[421]

Turkey is a secular state with no official state religion; the constitution provides for freedom of religion and conscience.[425][426] According to the CIA World Factbook, Muslims constitute 99.8% of the population, most of them being Sunni.[5] Based on a survey, KONDA's estimate for Muslims was 99.4% in 2006.[427] According to Minority Rights Group International, estimates of share of Alevi are between 10% and 40% of the population.[428] KONDA's estimate was 5% in 2006.[427] 4% of adult citizens identified as Alevi in a survey in 2021, while 88% identified as Sunni.[387]

The percentage of non-Muslims in modern-day Turkey was 19.1% in 1914, but fell to 2.5% in 1927.[429] Currently, non-Muslims constitute 0.2% of the population according to the World Factbook.[5] In 2006, KONDA's estimate was that 0.18% of the population adhered to non-Islamic religions.[427] Some of the non-Muslim communities are Armenians, Assyrians, Bulgarian Orthodox, Catholics, Greeks, Jews, and Protestants.[430] Sources estimate that the Christian population in Turkey ranges between 180,000 and 320,000.[431][432] Turkey has the largest Jewish community among the Muslim-majority countries.[433] Currently, there are 439 churches and synagogues in Turkey.[434]

In 2006, KONDA estimated that 0.47% of the population had no religion.[427] According to KONDA, the share of adult citizens who identified as nonbelievers increased from 2% in 2011 to 6% in 2021.[387] A 2020 Gezici Araştırma poll found that 28.5% of the Generation Z identified as irreligious.[435][436]

In the past 20 years, Turkey has improved quality of education and has made significant progress in increasing education access.[438] From 2011 to 2021, improvements in education access include significant rise in the rates of upper secondary and tertiary education completion, and quadrupling of pre-school institutions.[439] PISA results suggest improvements in education quality.[439] There is still a gap with OECD countries. Significant challenges include differences in student outcomes from different schools, differences between rural and urban areas, pre-primary education access, and arrival of students who are Syrian refugees.[439]

The Ministry of National Education is responsible for pre-tertiary education.[440] Compulsory education is free at public schools and lasts 12 years, divided into three parts.[441][438] There are 208 universities in Turkey.[371] Students are placed to universities based on their YKS results and their preferences, by the Measuring, Selection and Placement Center.[442] All state and private universities are under the control of the Higher Education Board. Since 2016, the president of Turkey directly appoints all rectors of all state and private universities.[443]

According to the 2024 Times Higher Education ranking, the top universities were Koç University, Middle East Technical University, Sabancı University, and Istanbul Technical University.[444] According to Academic Ranking of World Universities, the top ones were Istanbul University, University of Health Sciences (Turkey), and Hacettepe University.[445] For foreign students, Turkey has become a regional hub,[446] with a large number of international students[447]  
and international scholarships.[448][449][450]

The Ministry of Health has run a universal public healthcare system since 2003.[452] Known as Universal Health Insurance (Genel Sağlık Sigortası), it is funded by a tax surcharge on employers, currently at 5%.[452] Public-sector funding covers approximately 75.2% of health expenditures.[452] Despite the universal health care, total expenditure on health as a share of GDP in 2018 was the lowest among OECD countries at 6.3% of GDP, compared to the OECD average of 9.3%.[452] There are many private hospitals in the country.[453] The government planned several hospital complexes, known as city hospitals, to be constructed since 2013.[453] Turkey is one of the top 10 destinations for health tourism.[454]

Average life expectancy is 78.6 years (75.9 for males and 81.3 for females), compared with the EU average of 81 years.[452] Turkey has high rates of obesity, with 29.5% of its adult population having a body mass index (BMI) value of 30 or above.[455] Air pollution is a major cause of early death.[456]

In the 19th century, Turkish identity was debated in the Ottoman Empire, with three main views: Turkism, Islamism and Westernism.[457] In addition to Europe or Islam, Turkish culture was also influenced by Anatolia's native cultures.[458] After the establishment of the republic, Kemalism emphasized Turkish culture, attempted to make "Islam a matter of personal conviction", and pursued modernization.[459] Currently, Turkey has various local cultures. Things such as music, folk dance, or kebap variety may be used to identify a local area. Turkey also has a national culture, such as national sports leagues, music bands, film stars, and trends in fashion.[460] Turkey is home to 21 UNESCO World Heritage sites and 31 UNESCO intangible cultural heritage inscriptions.[461]

Turkish literature goes back more than a thousand years. The Seljuk and Ottoman periods include numerous works of literature and poetry. Turkic tales and poetry from Central Asia were also kept alive. Tales of Dede Korkut is an example of the oral narrative tradition. Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, from the 11th century, contains Turkish linguistic information and poetry. Yunus Emre, influenced by Rumi, was one of the most important writers of Anatolian Turkish poetry. Ottoman Divan poetry used "refined diction" and complex vocabulary. It included Sufi mysticism, romanticism, and formal elements.[462]

Beginning in the 19th century, Ottoman literature was influenced by the West. New genres, such as novels and journalistic style, were introduced. Aşk-ı Memnu, written by Halid Ziya Uşaklıgil, was the "first truly refined Turkish novel". Fatma Aliye Topuz, the first female Turkish novelist, wrote fiction. After the proclamation of the republic in 1923, Atatürk instituted reforms such as the language reform and alphabet reform. Since then, Turkish literature reflected the socioeconomic conditions in Turkey with increasing variety. "Village Novel" genre appeared in the mid-1950s, which talked about difficulties faced from poverty.[462] An example is Memed, My Hawk by Yaşar Kemal, which was Turkey's first Nobel Prize in Literature nominee in 1973.[462][463] Orhan Pamuk won the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature.[462]

Turkey has four "major theatrical traditions": "folk theatre, popular theatre, court theater, and Western theater." Turkish folk theatre goes back thousands of years and has survived among rural communities. Popular theatre includes plays by live actors, puppet and shadow plays, and storytelling performances. An example for shadow play is Karagöz and Hacivat. Court theatre was the refined version of popular theatre. Beginning in the 19th century, Western theatre tradition started appearing in Turkey. Following the establishment of Turkish Republic, a state conservatory and the State Theatre Company were formed.[464]

Turkey's visual arts scene can be categorized into two, as "decorative" and "fine" arts. Fine arts, or güzel sanatlar, includes sculpture and painting. Turkish artists in these areas have gained global recognition. Photography, fashion design, graphic arts, and graphic design are some of the other areas Turkish artists are known for in the world. The inaugural contemporary Turkish art sale by Sotheby's London was in 2009. Istanbul Modern and the Istanbul Biennial are examples of art galleries or exhibitions of contemporary Turkish art. Turkey has also seen a resurgence of traditional arts. This includes Ottoman-era traditional arts, such as ceramics and carpets. Textile and carpet design, glass and ceramics, calligraphy, paper marbling (ebru) are some of the art forms for which modern-day Turkish artists are recognized as leaders in the Islamic world.[465]

Although classifying genres of Turkish music can be problematic, three broad categories can be considered. These are  "Turkish folk music", "Turkish art music", and multiple popular music styles. These Popular music styles include arabesque, pop, and Anatolian rock.[466]

The resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as Ajda Pekkan, Sezen Aksu, Erol Evgin, MFÖ, Tarkan, Sertab Erener, Teoman, Kenan Doğulu, Levent Yüksel and Hande Yener.[citation needed] Internationally acclaimed Turkish jazz and blues musicians and composers include Ahmet Ertegun.[467]

Turkey is home to numerous Neolithic settlements, such as Çatalhöyük.[469][52] From the Bronze Age, important architectural remnants include Alaca Höyük and the 2nd layer of Troy.[52] There are various examples of Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman architectures, especially in the Aegean region.[470] Byzantine architecture dates back to the 4th century AD. Its best example is Hagia Sophia. Byzantine architectural style continued to develop after the conquest of Istanbul, such as Byzantine Revival architecture.[471] During Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and Turkish principalities period, a distinct architecture emerged, which incorporated Byzantine and Armenian architectures with architectural styles found in West Asia and Central Asia.[472] Seljuk architecture often used stones and bricks, and produced numerous caravanserais, madrasas and mausoleums.[473]

Ottoman architecture emerged in northwest Anatolia and Thrace. Early Ottoman architecture mixed "traditional Anatolian Islamic architecture with local building materials and techniques".[474] Following the conquest of Istanbul, classical Ottoman architecture emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries.[475] The most important architect of the classical period is Mimar Sinan, whose major works include the Şehzade Mosque, Süleymaniye Mosque, and Selimiye Mosque.[475] Beginning in the 18th century, Ottoman architecture was influenced by European elements, resulting in development of Ottoman baroque style.[476] European influence continued in the 19th century; examples include works of Balyan family such as neo-Baroque style Dolmabahçe Palace.[477] The last period of Ottoman architecture consists of the First National Architectural Movement, including works of Vedat Tek and Mimar Kemaleddin.[476]

Since 1918, Turkish architecture can be divided into three parts. From 1918 to 1950, the first one includes the First National Architectural Movement period, which transitioned into modernist architecture. Modernist and monumental buildings were preferred for public buildings, whereas "Turkish house" type vernacular architecture influenced private houses.

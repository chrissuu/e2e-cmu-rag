Beloit (/bəˈlɔɪt/ ⓘ bə-LOYT)[3] is a city in Rock County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located along the Rock River in southern Wisconsin, on the state border with Illinois. The population was 36,657 at the 2020 census, while the Janesville–Beloit metropolitan statistical area consisting solely of Rock County has an estimated 165,000 residents.[4]

Twelve men in Colebrook, New Hampshire created the "New England Emigrating Company" in October 1836, and sent Horace White to find a suitable region of Wisconsin in which to settle. The level fields and the water power of Turtle Creek and "unlimited gravel" in the area around what is now Beloit fixed the site of the village and farms. White purchased the land. At the same time as the Colebrook settlers, six families from Bedford, New Hampshire, arrived and settled in the region. They said the Rock River Valley had a "New England look" that made them feel at home. The village was platted in 1838 and was planned with wide streets, building on the New England model.

Beloit was originally named New Albany (after Albany, Vermont) in 1837 by its founder, Caleb Blodgett. The name was changed to Beloit in 1838.[5][6] The name was coined to be reminiscent of Detroit.[5]

Beloit lays claim to such inventions as the speedometer,[7] John Francis Appleby's twine binder,[8] and Korn Kurls, which resemble Cheetos, and the original puffed cheese snack.[9][10]

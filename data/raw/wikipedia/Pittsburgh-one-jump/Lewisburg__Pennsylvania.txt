Lewisburg[a] is a borough in Union County, Pennsylvania, United States, 30 miles (48 km) south by southeast of Williamsport and 60 miles (97 km) north of Harrisburg. The population was 5,158 as of the 2020 census.[3] It is the county seat of Union County.[4] Located in central Pennsylvania's Susquehanna Valley, on the West Branch Susquehanna River, it is home to Bucknell University. Its 19th-century downtown, centered around Market Street, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Lewisburg is the principal city of the Lewisburg Micropolitan Statistical Area, and is also part of the larger Bloomsburg–Berwick–Sunbury Combined Statistical Area.

Lewisburg was founded in 1785 by Ludwig Derr. A settler of the area (since as early as 1763–1769), Derr purchased several tracts of land from the William Penn family and other neighboring landowners, the largest of which was known as "The Prescott". Having been on the land for such a long time, Derr had befriended the local Native Americans of the area. His relationship with these indigenous peoples was so well founded that, even as many of the other local settlers' homesteads were routinely sacked by Native Americans, Derr's lands remained free from attacks. Subsequently, in 1784, he worked with Samuel Weiser to lay out his combined land tracts, and create Derrstown. The name was later changed to Lewisburgh when Snyder County was created from Union County in 1855 (according to a local Keystone marker sign), but was known on original plans and deeds as Lewisburg before that time.

U.S. Postal Service states that it was named Lewisburgh when it was established in 1796; in 1893, the name was shortened to Lewisburg.[5]

The origin of the street names that run east-west is also unknown. St. George, St. Catherine, and St. Louis appear to be named for saints. While Lutherans, as was Derr, do recognize historic Catholic saints, the street names are more likely named for Derr's family members, whose names happen to coincide with saints. Those streets are consecutively parallel and emanate from what was then Derr's home and the location of the first available lot sold (which were both situated on what is now Mill Street). George was Ludwig's son, his wife was Catherine, and himself, Ludwig/Lewis/Louis (sic). The other original street names that still exist are St. John, St. Mary and St. Anthony, which may be the names of other children from families with whom Derr's own family were friends. However, there is an indication that Derr also had a daughter named Mary. The premise is further supported by the notion that the German word for street is Strasse (Straße, abbreviated St). At the time, street names were pronounced as Strasse Mary or Strasse George. Later, when signs were made to note the street names, the abbreviation for Strasse was allowed to remain, but the US/English abbreviation was redundantly added to the signs.[citation needed]

Over the centuries, Lewisburg has been a center of commerce in Union County. The West Branch Susquehanna River was used for logging and shipping, and remains of old factories and other ancient stone structures exist along the river banks. Prior to, and during, the Civil War, many abolitionists lived in the area, and several locations within the town of Lewisburg served as stopping points on the famous Underground Railroad.

The Susquehanna River has flooded on several occasions, notably in 1889, 1936, and 1972. The 1936 flood saw record-high water levels, while after the 1972 flood, the houses that formerly stood where Hufnagle Park is today were demolished.[6]

The Lewisburg Historic District, Chamberlin Iron Front Building, Packwood House-American Hotel, and Reading Railroad Freight Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[7]

Kurt Steven Angle (born December 9, 1968) is an American retired professional wrestler and amateur wrestler. Currently, he is a sports analyst for Real American Freestyle. He first earned recognition for winning a gold medal in freestyle wrestling at the 1996 Summer Olympics despite competing with a broken neck,[2] and achieved wider fame and recognition for his tenures in WWE and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). 

Angle won numerous accolades while at Clarion University of Pennsylvania, including being a two-time NCAA Division I Wrestling Champion in the Heavyweight division. After graduating, he won gold medals in freestyle wrestling at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships and 1996 Summer Olympics. He is one of four people to win the Junior Nationals, NCAA, World Championships, and the Olympics. In 2006, he was named by USA Wrestling as the greatest shoot wrestler of all time and as one of USA Wrestling's top 15 college wrestlers of all time. In 2016, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.[3]

Angle made his first appearance at a professional wrestling event in 1996, and signed with the WWF (now WWE) in 1998. Although he was never a fan of professional wrestling and previously had a negative opinion of it due to its scripted nature, he was noted for his natural aptitude for it; after training for only a few days, he had his debut match within the WWF's developmental system in August 1998 and had his first official WWF match in March 1999. After months of dark matches, Angle made his televised in-ring debut in November 1999. Within two months, he was holding the European and Intercontinental Championships simultaneously. Four months later, he won the 2000 King of the Ring tournament and began pursuing the WWF Championship, which he won in October and would go on to win a total of four times. He also became a one-time WCW Champion and one-time World Heavyweight Champion. He is the tenth professional wrestler to achieve the WWE Triple Crown and the fifth to achieve the WWE Grand Slam. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame's class of 2017.

After leaving WWE in 2006, Angle joined TNA, where he became a record six-time TNA World Heavyweight Champion (and the inaugural) and the second TNA Triple Crown winner, holding all three TNA championships simultaneously. He is also a two-time King of the Mountain. During his tenure with TNA, he also competed for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF), winning the IWGP Heavyweight Championship once. In 2013, he was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. He is the second wrestler, after Sting, to be inducted into both the WWE and TNA Halls of Fame.

Angle has won over 21 professional wrestling championships and is an overall 13-time world champion. He is the only wrestler to have won the WWE Championship, World Heavyweight Championship, WCW Championship, TNA World Heavyweight Championship, IWGP Heavyweight Championship, and an NCAA Wrestling Championship. He is also the first person to hold both the WWE and TNA Triple Crowns. He has headlined numerous pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania XIX and Bound for Glory on three occasions (in 2007, 2010, and 2011), the flagship events of WWE and TNA, respectively. In 2004, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter inducted Angle into its Hall of Fame and later named him "Wrestler of the Decade" for the 2000s.[4] Fellow professional wrestler John Cena called Angle "without question the most gifted all-around performer we have ever had step into a ring" and said "there will never be another like him".[5]

Kurt Steven Angle[6] was born in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, on December 9, 1968, the son of Jackie and David Angle.[7] He is of Welsh, German, Irish, Polish and Lithuanian descent.[8] He has four older brothers named David, Mark, John, and Eric, the latter of whom is also a wrestler; his older sister, Le'Anne, died at the age of 43 in 2003.[9] He attended Clarion University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a degree in education in 1993.[10] His father was a crane operator who died in a construction accident while working on Fifth Avenue Place when Angle was 16.[11] Angle dedicated both his career and his autobiography to his father. He stated in an interview that, following his father's death, he regarded his wrestling coach David Schultz as a paternal figure. While training Angle, Schultz was murdered in January 1996 by John Eleuthère du Pont, the sponsor of Schultz's team of Olympic prospectives.[12][13][14] Angle's mother died of cancer in 2015.[15]

Kurt Angle started amateur wrestling at the age of seven.[16] He attended Mt. Lebanon High School,[13] where he won varsity letters in football, as an All-State linebacker, and wrestling.[13][17][18] He was undefeated on the freshman wrestling team and qualified for the state wrestling tournament his sophomore year.[13] Angle placed third at the state wrestling tournament as a junior and was the 1987 Pennsylvania class AAA wrestling state champion as a senior.[19]

Upon graduating from high school, Angle attended Clarion University of Pennsylvania, where he continued to wrestle at the amateur level.[20] He was a two-time National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I champion,[21] national runner-up in 1991, and a three-time NCAA Division I All-American. In addition, Angle was the 1987 USA Junior Freestyle champion, a two-time USA Senior Freestyle champion, and the 1988 USA International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles Junior World Freestyle champion.[22]

After graduating from college, Angle continued to wrestle, though he did have an unsuccessful tryout with the Pittsburgh Steelers at running back, despite not playing football in college.[23] In 1995, he won a gold medal at the FILA Wrestling World Championships in Atlanta, Georgia.[21] Following this victory, Angle began preparing for the 1996 Summer Olympics (also in Atlanta) under Dave Schultz at the Pennsylvanian Foxcatcher Club,[24] training between eight and ten hours a day.[25] In January 1996, not long after Angle began training at the club, Schultz was murdered by John Eleuthère du Pont, the sponsor of Schultz's team of Olympic prospectives.[12][26][14] As a result, Angle quit du Pont's team, searched for new sponsors, and joined the Dave Schultz Wrestling Club in Schultz's memory.[27]

Angle faced further hardships while taking part in the 1996 Olympic Trials, when he suffered a severe neck injury, fracturing two of his cervical vertebrae,[28] herniating two discs, and pulling four muscles. Nonetheless, Angle won the trials and then spent the subsequent five months resting and rehabilitating. By the Olympics, Angle was able to compete, albeit with several pain-reducing injections in his neck.[21] In the fall of 1996, Angle stated that he temporarily became addicted to the analgesic Vicodin after injuring his neck.[29] He won his gold medal in the heavyweight (90–100 kg; 198–220 lb) weight class despite his injury,[22] defeating several competitors including Mongolian Dolgorsürengiin Sumyaabazar, Cuban Wilfredo Morales, Ukrainian Sagid Murtazaliev, and others.[30] Angle won four close matches to earn his spot in the gold-medal finals.[31]

In 2006, Angle was named the greatest shoot wrestler of all time by USA Wrestling,[32] as well as one of the top 15 college wrestlers.[32] In April 2011, Angle revealed that he was planning a comeback to amateur wrestling for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[33][34] He later announced he was unable to make the trials for the national team due to a knee injury, though he held an honorary title as team manager.[35] In 2016, Angle was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame for his amateur wrestling accomplishments.[36]

On October 26, 1996, Angle was convinced by fellow Pittsburgh native Shane Douglas to attend the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) event High Incident.[22] He gave an in-ring interview and provided guest commentary during a match between Taz and Little Guido, but left the building after Raven attached Sandman to a cross using barbed wire.[37] Angle, shocked by the controversial imagery and afraid that his career prospects were going to be damaged if he was associated with the incident, threatened to sue ECW owner Paul Heyman if he was shown on television in the same broadcast as the stunt.[22]

Despite achieving success in amateur wrestling, Angle initially held professional wrestling in low regard.[38] He rejected a decade-long contract with the WWF due to his unwillingness to accept scripted losses.[39][40] His opinion of professional wrestling changed when he began watching WWF Raw is War in 1998 and developed an admiration for Stone Cold Steve Austin's talents as an entertainer.[39] He later conceded that his negative attitude toward the industry was misguided and "stupid".[38]

In 1998, Angle had a tryout with the WWF after the rescindment of the WWF's original 1996 offer.[40] He was subsequently signed to a five-year deal in August 1998,[41] just three days after his tryout.[40] Angle trained under Dory Funk Jr. at the Funkin' Dojo training camp in Stamford, Connecticut. Within a week, he started wrestling in front of a live audience.[38] His debut match occurred in the WWF's then-developmental territory WWA on August 20, where he faced his trainer Tom Prichard.[42]

Angle continued to wrestle for the WWA in August and September. Additionally, he sought bookings outside of the WWF, participating in a battle royal won by Steve Williams at the National Wrestling Alliance's (NWA) 50th Anniversary Show on October 24. Angle also performed for Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling (PCW) defeating Steve Bradley and the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) in February 1999 defeating Cyborg.[42]

In March, Angle began wrestling regularly for the WWF's Power Pro Wrestling (PPW) developmental league in Memphis, Tennessee.[42] He appeared on WWF television on Sunday Night Heat, where he took part in an angle with Tiger Ali Singh. He won over Brian Christopher on April 11. In the following months, Angle wrestled on house shows and in other dark matches, in preparation for his televised debut. He faced against Owen Hart in a dark match on Shotgun Saturday Night just two weeks before Owen died.[43] He also continued to wrestle for PPW through October and on July 24 won the PPW Championship. Angle then lost the championship to Steve Bradley on August 7. He is noted for learning the art of pro wrestling quicker than almost anyone else;[40] WWE executive and former opponent Triple H described Angle as "probably the fastest guy I've ever seen pick this business up", owing to "phenomenal" athleticism and an "aptitude" for the industry.[44]

Angle made his televised WWF debut on November 14, 1999, at Survivor Series, where he defeated Shawn Stasiak.[45] He remained undefeated in singles competition until losing to the debuting Tazz at the Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000.[46]


In the months that followed, Angle captured both the European Championship (on the February 10 episode of SmackDown!) and the Intercontinental Championship (at No Way Out on February 27), holding both titles simultaneously.[47] He lost both championships in a triple threat match at WrestleMania 2000 without being pinned.[48] 
Throughout mid-2000, Angle aligned himself with Edge & Christian and feuded with Too Cool and Rikishi, with Angle defeating Rikishi in the finals of the King of the Ring tournament on June 25.[49] Later he feuded with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon,[50][49] which culminated in a triple threat main event at SummerSlam for the WWF Championship also involving The Rock, who retained his championship.[51]

On October 22, 2000, Angle defeated The Rock at No Mercy to win the WWF Championship for the first time.[49][52] Angle's first year on the main roster is widely regarded as the most impressive rookie year in professional wrestling history. In under 12 months, he won multiple championships, headlined pay-per-view events, and quickly established himself as a main-event-level talent. Wrestling publications and analysts have often cited his 1999–2000 run as one of the most accomplished debut years ever seen in the industry.

Angle retained the WWF Championship for the rest of the year in matches with The Undertaker at Survivor Series on November 19 and in a six-man Hell in a Cell match against The Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, and Rikishi at Armageddon on December 10.[53] After beating Triple H at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001,[54] Angle eventually lost the title to The Rock at No Way Out on February 25.[55] Angle then feuded with Chris Benoit, whom he defeated at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, but lost to him at Backlash on April 29 in an Ultimate Submission match. Continuing the feud, Angle again defeated Benoit in a two-out-of-three-falls match at Judgment Day on May 20.[56]

When World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and ECW were purchased by the WWF in 2001, wrestlers from WCW and ECW formed The Alliance. Angle and WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin joined forces to repel them, turning Angle face in the process. At the Invasion event on July 22, Angle and Austin captained a team of five WWF superstars against members of the Alliance. Team WWF lost to Team Alliance when Austin turned on Team WWF to join the Alliance.[57] Angle then began feuding with Austin over the WWF Championship and challenged him for the title at SummerSlam on August 19, and defeated Austin by disqualification.[58] After winning and losing the WCW Championship, WCW United States Championship, and the WWF Hardcore Championship in matches with Alliance members, Angle defeated Austin to win his second WWF Championship at Unforgiven on September 23.[59][60] Angle lost the title to Austin on the October 8 episode of Raw.[61] Angle later turned heel again and joined the Alliance himself. Angle ultimately returned to the WWF side by enabling The Rock to defeat Austin in a "Winner Takes All" match between the WWF and The Alliance at the Survivor Series on November 18.[59]

In his first Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, Angle lasted until the final two before being eliminated by eventual winner Triple H. Angle briefly feuded with Kane, defeating him at WrestleMania X8 on March 17.[62] Angle was drafted to the SmackDown! brand and then reignited his feud with Edge, defeating him at Backlash on April 21. The naturally balding Angle lost a "hair versus hair" match to Edge at Judgment Day on May 19, having his head shaved bald, which he would retain for the rest of his career.[63][64] During mid-2002, John Cena made his WWE televised debut, losing to Angle after a roll-up pin on the June 27 episode of SmackDown!.[65]

In September 2002, Angle started to feud with Chris Benoit, losing to him at Unforgiven on September 22. Angle and Benoit were teamed together to participate in a tournament to crown the first WWE Tag Team Champions. They won the tournament finals at No Mercy on October 20 making Angle the fifth WWE Grand Slam Champion.[citation needed] The match at No Mercy was named the 2002 Match of the Year by Wrestling Observer Newsletter.[66] They made their first successful title defense by defeating Los Guerreros (Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero) at Rebellion on October 26.[67] Their reign ended after they lost the title to Edge and Mysterio on the November 7 episode of SmackDown! in a two-out-of-three-falls match. Angle and Benoit would receive another shot at the WWE Tag Team Championship in a triple threat elimination match against Edge and Mysterio and Los Guerreros at Survivor Series on November 17, but failed after they were the first team eliminated; Los Guerreros eventually won.[68]

Angle won his third WWE Championship at Armageddon on December 15 by defeating Big Show.[69] During this reign, he aligned with  manager Paul Heyman and recently-formed  "Team Angle" (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin).  He began a rivalry with Brock Lesnar, who had won the 2003 Royal Rumble.[70] Angle lost the title to Lesnar at WrestleMania XIX,[71] needing time off for neck surgery. Rather than a traditional spinal fusion, he underwent a less invasive procedure where only the spurs and selected portions of the discs were removed, reducing his recovery time from one year to three months.[citation needed]

Angle returned on the June 5 episode of SmackDown! and a month later won his fourth WWE Championship at Vengeance in a triple threat match against Lesnar and Big Show.[72] He successfully defended the title at SummerSlam but lost it back to Lesnar in a 60-Minute Iron Man match on the September 18 episode ofSmackDown!.[73]  At Survivor Series, Angle led a five-man team against Lesnar’s, winning the match despite being eliminated.[74]

In early 2004, Angle began feuding with Eddie Guerrero. After becoming number one contender at No Way Out by defeating John Cena and Big Show, he turned heel by attacking Guerrero during a title defense on SmackDown!.[75]  Angle lost to Guerrero at WrestleMania XX and later took time off for another neck surgery.[76] He returned as SmackDown's on-screen General Manager on March 25,[77]  continuing his feud with Guerrero. At The Great American Bash, Angle helped JBL defeat Guerrero for the WWE Championship. He was later fired as GM by Vince McMahon after faking an injury, leading to a rematch with Guerrero at SummerSlam, which Angle won.[78]

Angle's feud with Guerrero continued into the fall, culminating in a match at No Mercy, where Angle lost to Big Show.[79] On the November 4 episode of SmackDown!, during a segment of Tough Enough, Angle challenged contestants to physical competitions, where Chris Nawrocki won an opportunity to have a match against Angle.[80] During this match, Angle would legitimately break Nawrocki's ribs whilst performing a  double leg takedown.[80] Angle then faced Daniel Puder, a professional MMA fighter. Puder locked in a kimura lock during their unscripted exchange, but referee Jim Korderas quickly counted a pinfall on Puder despite his shoulders not being down to protect Angle from injury and having to submit.[81][80] Puder later claimed he would have broken Angle's arm had the match continued[80], whilst Angle was reported to have been "less than happy backstage"[81] over the whole incident.

At the 2005 Royal Rumble, Angle failed to win the WWE Championship in a triple threat match against JBL and Big Show. He later entered the Royal Rumble match but was quickly eliminated by Shawn Michaels. In retaliation, Angle returned to eliminate Michaels,[82] beginning a heated rivalry. After mocking Michaels by defeating Michaels' former tag team partner Marty Jannetty, and attacking Michaels' former manager Sherri Martel,  Angle defeated Michaels at WrestleMania 21 in a match which won Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Match of the Year award.[82]

Later in mid-April Angle entered a tournament to determine the number-one contender for the WWE Championship, defeating Eddie Guerrero and starting a feud with fellow tournament entrant Booker T. Over the following weeks, in a controversial storyline Angle began sexually harassing Booker’s wife, Sharmell.[83][84]  Booker defeated Angle at Judgment Day,  but Angle won a mixed handicap against Booker and Sharmell match on SmackDown![85] before losing the feud in a final singles match on June 9.[86]  A few days later, Angle also appeared at ECW One Night Stand on June 12 as an anti-ECW “crusader” and was involved in a brawl with ECW alumni led by Stone Cold Steve Austin.[87]

Following the 2005 WWE draft in June, Angle was moved to the Raw brand and resumed his feud with Michaels, losing to him at Vengeance.[88] In July he began a brief rivalry with Eugene, who won Angle’s Olympic gold medal after Angle was unable to make him submit in a match within three minutes.[89] Angle regained the medal at SummerSlam.[90] Angle then entered a feud with WWE Champion John Cena, facing him at Unforgiven, Taboo Tuesday, and Survivor Series, each time failing to win the title.[91][92][93]  He continued the rivalry into 2006, defeating Cena in a non-title first blood match on Raw,[94] but again failed to capture the championship at New Year’s Revolution in the annual Elimination Chamber match.[95]

Angle returned to the SmackDown! brand on January 13, 2006, winning a 20-man battle royal as a surprise entrant to claim the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, becoming a face in the process.[96][97] He retained the title against Mark Henry at the Royal Rumble, after which The Undertaker challenged him.[98] At No Way Out  Angle defeated The Undertaker in a critically acclaimed title match.[99][100][101]  A rematch on the March 3 episode of SmackDown! ended in disqualification, allowing Angle to retain the title heading into WrestleMania 22.[102] However, at WrestleMania Angle lost the title to Rey Mysterio in a triple threat match, which also involved Randy Orton.[103] In the 2006 brand draft Angle was moved to the new ECW brand,[104] adopting the nickname "The Wrestling Machine," wearing a mouth guard and quickly squashing opponents. 

Angle made sporadic appearances through mid-2006, inlucluding unsuccessfully challenging Rob Van Dam for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on June 27.[105]. On August 25, WWE granted his release due to health concerns.[106][107] In the Kurt Angle: Champion documentary DVD, Angle stated he had been working through serious injuries and needed time off. His final WWE match was at an ECW house show on August 14, where he defeated Danny Doring.[108]

Angle debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on October 19, 2006, shortly after signing with the company, making an immediate impact by confronting Samoa Joe, who had refused to return the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt he had stolen from Jeff Jarrett. The confrontation sparked a heated feud between Angle and Joe, culminating in Angle defeating Joe at Genesis in November 19, ending Joe's undefeated streak in the company.[109] Angle then lost to Joe in a rematch on December 10 at Turning Point.

Angle and Joe fought again at Final Resolution on January 14, 2007, with Angle winning once more and earning a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He faced the champion, Christian Cage, at Against All Odds, but lost due to interference from Tomko and Scott Steiner. This led to a brief feud with Steiner, whom Angle defeated at Destination X. Angle then captained a team against Cage's in a Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown, where the man who gained the winning pinfall would earn a title shot for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Angle's team emerged victorious, with Sting being awarded the title shot. However, on the day of the Sacrifice PPV, where Angle, Sting and Cage would face each other for the championship,[110] the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) severed ties with TNA and stripped its champions of their titles.[111]  Despite this, the triple threat match between Angle, Sting, and Cage still took place, with Angle declared the unofficial winner of the new "World Heavyweight Champion" after making Sting submit whilst Sting simultaneously pinned Cage.[112]

In the aftermath, Angle unveiled the newly created TNA World Heavyweight Championship, though the title was later vacated later that night due to the controversial finish at Sacrifice. A tournament for the championship culminated at Slammiversary 2007, where Angle won the King of the Mountain match match, officially becoming the inaugural TNA World Heavyweight Champion.[113] He soon entered into a heated program with Samoa Joe once again, this time playing the role of heel. At Hard Justice, the two faced off in a tag team match where all championships the two held were on the line at the time; Angle held the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and IWGP Heavyweight Championship, while Joe held the X Division and Tag Team titles. With help from his then-wife Karen Angle, Angle won the bout, becoming TNA’s second Triple Crown champion, as well as the first to hold all eligible titles simultaneously.[114] A month later Angle dropped both the X Division and Tag Team Championships to Jay Lethal and Team Pacman respectively, at No Surrender on September 9. 

Angle was more successful on holding on to the World Championship. While he briefly lost the title to Sting at Bound for Glory in October,[115] he won it back on the October 25 episode of Impact!.[116] He then formed an alliance with A.J. Styles and Tomko, known as The Angle Alliance, and entered another feud with Christian Cage. He successfully defended the title against Cage at Final Resolution and Against All Odds in early 2008 with help from his Alliance. However at Lockdown on April 13, despite interference from the Alliance Angle lost the championship to Samoa Joe.

Later that year, Angle returned from neck injury[citation needed] and attacked A.J. Styles, kicking off another feud which lead to Angle and Jeff Jarrett's paths crossing. After feuding with Styles and Jeff Jarrett throughout the summer, Angle aligned with Jarrett’s enemies (Booker T, Kevin Nash, Sting and Scott Steiner) to form the Main Event Mafia, a stable of established wrestling veterans positioned against younger talent. The stable would dominate TNA for much of late 2008 and early 2009. During this time, Angle had multiple main-event matches with Abyss, Rhino, and continued to feud with Jarrett, culminating in a loss to him at Bound for Glory IV in a match featuring Mick Foley as the enforcer.

In 2009, Angle lost control of the Main Event Mafia to Sting after a match at Sacrifice, but regained leadership after winning the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for a fourth time at Slammiversary via assistance from Samoa Joe. On the following episode of Impact!, Angle and the rest of the Mafia attacked Sting while introducing Joe as their newest member. Angle held the title until No Surrender, losing the belt to A.J. Styles captured the belt in a five-way match. Angle turned face a month later,  praising TNA’s younger talent and leaving the Mafia on the October 22 episode of Impact!.[117]

Following his departure from the Main Event Mafia, Angle began feuding with Desmond Wolfe, trading wins in late 2009[118][119][120]  before ultimately defeating him in a "Three Degrees of Pain" match at Final Resolution. In early 2010, he entered a title feud with A.J. Styles, now aligned with Ric Flair, losing multiple championship matches against Styles due to murky finishes and interference. Frustrated, Angle teased leaving the company[121] but ultimately stayed and feuded with Mr. Anderson after losing in the 8 Card Stud Tournament at Against All Odds.[122]   The feud saw both men trading victories through early 2010, ending with a steel cage match at Lockdown, which Angle won.[123] which Angle won. Angle then took a brief hiatus but returned in May, vowing to climb the new TNA Top 10 Rankings on merit and earn another title shot.[124] Over the next few episodes of Impact! and TNA PPVs, Angle defeated several of the other "Top 10" ranked wrestlers, (Kazarian,[125] Desmond Wolfe,[126] D’Angelo Dinero,[127] Hernandez,[128] and A.J. Styles[129]), boldly claiming that he would retire if he lost during this climb.[130]


Angle would not get the opportunity to rise any higher in the ranks. In August the TNA World Heavyweight Championship was vacated, with an eight-man tournament created to crown anew champion.[131][132] While Angle was victorious in his first-round match,[133] at No Surrender Angle faced Jeff Hardy in the semi-finals. The match first ended in a time-limit draw and later, after the match was restarted, a no-contest due to Angle accidentally blading his forehead too deeply.[134] Both men were added to the finals at Bound for Glory, where Angle was pinned by Hardy after interference from Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan, who turned heel and formed Immortal with Hardy, Jarrett, and Abyss.[135]
Following the loss, on the next episode of Impact! Angle teased making good on his vow and retiring, but was attacked by Jarett and TNA's security officers Gunner and Murphy,[136] with Jarett revealing he was involved with ensuring Angle lost at Bound for Glory. Throughout the spring of 2011 the two would bitterly feud over a series of personal and intense matches, which often featured Jarret's wife (and Angle's ex-wife) Karen, playing upon the real-life tension between the trio.[137] Eventually, the feud ended with Angle defeating Jarrett in a loser-leaves Parking Lot Brawl on the June 16 episode of Impact Wrestling, forcing Jarett to leave TNA.[138]

The month prior, Angle signed a new three-year contract with TNA, stating he was "here for the long haul."[139]

After ending his feud with Jeff Jarrett, Angle allied with Sting to oppose the Immortal stable, including TNA World Heavyweight Champion Mr. Anderson.[140] On the July 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, Angle helped Sting reclaim the title from Anderson.[141]  At Hardcore Justice on August 7, Angle defeated Sting to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for a record fifth time, turning heel in the process after hitting him with a chair.[142]

Angle later revealed he opposed Sting’s plan to return control of TNA to Dixie Carter, claiming Carter had lied to him about her knowledge of the Jarretts’ relationship. He aligned with Hulk Hogan and Immortal, vowing to dismantle TNA’s younger talent, starting with attacking Crimson that night.[143] Angle successfully defended the title against Sting,[144] Mr. Anderson,[145][146]  and Bobby Roode[147] in the following months. However, on October 20, he lost the championship to James Storm.[148][149]

Angle returned in November, attacking Storm and revealing himself as the person who had cost him a title match the previous week.[150]  Their feud continued through the end of 2011, with both men trading wins and Storm ultimately coming out on top.[151][152][153] In early 2012, Angle returned to begin a rivalry with Jeff Hardy, defeating him at Victory Road but losing a steel cage rematch at Lockdown.[154][155] Angle then feuded with A.J. Styles and defeated him at Sacrifice, turning face by saving Styles from an attack by Daniels and Kazarian.[156][157][158]  At Slammiversary, Angle and Styles defeated the duo to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship,[159]  although they lost the titles back to them weeks later.[160]  Angle participated in the 2012 Bound for Glory Series but was eliminated by Jeff Hardy. He and Styles unsuccessfully challenged for the tag titles at No Surrender[161] and Bound for Glory[162] .

On May 13 at Sacrifice, Angle defeated Styles in a rematch, following another interference from Daniels and Kazarian. After the match, Angle made the save for Styles, chasing Daniels and Kazarian out of the ring. This turned Angle face once again.On June 10 at Slammiversary, Angle and Styles defeated Daniels and Kazarian to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship.On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Angle entered the 2012 Bound for Glory Series, taking part in the opening gauntlet match, from which he was eliminated by Daniels.[163] Two weeks later, Angle and Styles lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship back to Daniels and Kazarian.[160] Angle wrestled his final match in the 2012 Bound for Glory Series on the August 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, losing to Jeff Hardy, which resulted in him being eliminated from the tournament.[164] On September 9 at No Surrender[161] and Bound for Glory[162] On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Angle defeated Daniels and Styles in a three-way match to become one of four wrestlers in consideration for a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.[165]

In late 2012, Angle began feuding with the Aces & Eights stable after being attacked by them on the October 25 episode of Impact Wrestling.[166] He defeated stable member Devon at Turning Point[167] An and continued battling the group with other wrestlers such as Samoa Joe and Wes Brisco. He later unmasked D'Lo Brown as the group's vice president and continued feuding with Aces & Eights through early 2013.[168][169][170][171]

By May, Angle had entered a feud with A.J. Styles, who had refused to answer whether was associated with Aces & Eights on the May 9, 2013, episode of Impact Wrestling.[172] This resulted in a match at Slammiversary XI, where Angle won.[173]  That same night, he was announced as the second inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame.[174] Shortly after, Angle began a storyline with the debuting Rampage Jackson and later joined Sting in reforming the Main Event Mafia.[175]  The new faction would soon recruit Samoa Joe, Magnus, and Jackson.[176][177][178] Angle's association with the storyline would be cut short, following when in August he went on hiatus after entering rehab for drug and alcohol use.[179]

Angle returned on the October 10, 2013, episode of Impact Wrestling, attacking EGO and challenging Bobby Roode to a match at Bound For Glory. In the lead-up, Roode mocked Angle’s Hall of Fame induction, provoking a feud. At the pay-per-view, Angle declined to accept the Hall of Fame honor, stating he hadn't earned it and wanted to achieve more in TNA. Later that night, he was defeated by Roode after a rough landing during a suplex.[180] Their rivalry continued, with Angle suffering (kayfabe) injuries, including concussions,[181] amnesia[182] and issues with his knee.[183] Despite being cleared later, Angle was attacked again by Roode and lost further matches in the ongoing TNA World Title tournament due to Roode's interference. At Genesis, Angle defeated Roode in a steel cage match to end their feud.

In early 2014, Angle began a feud with Ethan Carter III (EC3), who injured his knee during an attack. Angle officially accepted his Hall of Fame induction on February 27, but the ceremony was interrupted by EC3. At Sacrifice, Angle teamed with Willow to defeat EC3 and Rockstar Spud.

Angle's team won both matches.[190]

He returned on January 4, 2009, at Wrestle Kingdom III in Tokyo Dome in a special eight-man tag match, where he, Kevin Nash, Chono, and Riki Choshu faced Great Bash Heel (Giant Bernard, Karl Anderson, Takashi Iizuka, and Tomohiro Ishii), with Angle getting the win for his team.[191] Angle then went on to defeat Bernard in a singles match at New Japan's ISM tour on February 15.[192] After Hiroshi Tanahashi retained the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Nakamura in the main event, Angle challenged him for the title, which Tanahashi accepted.[192] Tanahashi defeated Angle on April 5 at New Japan's Resolution '09 to retain the title.[193]

At TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, Angle has his first match with WWE in 11 years when he teamed with The Shield (Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins) to defeat the team of Braun Strowman, Kane, The Miz, Sheamus, and Cesaro in a TLC match.[202] On the October 30 episode of Raw, while addressing the fans, commissioner Stephanie McMahon confronted Angle, announcing that Angle would be the team captain of Team Raw at Survivor Series, adding that if Team Raw would lose, Angle would be fired. At the event, Angle's teammate Triple H attacked him, leading to his elimination by Shane McMahon; however, Team Raw still went on to win the match. At the Elimination Chamber, Angle, along with Stephanie McMahon and Triple H, was present when Ronda Rousey signed her Raw contract, where Angle brought up the confrontation that Stephanie McMahon and Triple H had with Rousey and The Rock at WrestleMania 31 and that they both want to manipulate her. This caused Rousey to put Triple H through a table and be slapped by Stephanie McMahon before signing her contract. The following night on Raw, Angle claimed the allegations he made were false, to keep his job, before being attacked by Triple H. As a result, the following week, Angle scheduled himself to team with Rousey against Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in a mixed tag team match at WrestleMania 34, which Angle and Rousey won.[203] Angle participated in the 50-man Royal Rumble match at the Greatest Royal Rumble event later that month. He entered at number 16 and eliminated Bo Dallas, Primo Colón, and Dolph Ziggler before being eliminated by Elias. Following WrestleMania, Angle found himself in a power struggle over control of Raw, when the McMahon family appointed Baron Corbin as the constable of Monday Nights on the June 4 episode of Raw. This continued until the August 20 episode, when Stephanie McMahon sent Angle on "vacation" before announcing that Corbin would be acting general manager in Angle's absence.[204]

On the October 8, 2018, episode of Raw, Angle made a surprise return, disguised as "The Conquistador", winning a battle royal after last eliminating Baron Corbin to qualify for the WWE World Cup at Crown Jewel.[205] At the event, Angle was defeated by Dolph Ziggler in the first round of the WWE World Cup Tournament.[206] On November 5, Angle competed in his first match on Raw since 2006, for a spot in the Survivor Series men's tag team match, losing to Drew McIntyre, with McIntyre using Angle's own ankle lock finishing maneuver to make him submit.[207] Angle returned at TLC on December 16 to help Braun Strowman, along with Apollo Crews, Finn Bálor, Bobby Roode, Chad Gable, defeat Baron Corbin to strip him of authoritative power.[208] The next night on Raw, Angle, along with Crews, Roode, and Gable, easily defeated Corbin in a no-disqualification handicap match to prevent him from being the permanent general manager of Raw.[209] At the 2019 Royal Rumble on January 27, 2019, Angle entered the match at number four but was eliminated by Shinsuke Nakamura.[210]

When Angle began to train as a professional wrestler, he was asked to not watch old tapes, since the style had changed during the Attitude Era and the matches were more aggressive. Instead, he learned by watching then-current wrestlers such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, or The Rock.[231] Angle said his match against The Rock at No Way Out 2001 was the transition between the "funny, goofy Kurt Angle to a more serious competitor", including more offense.[232]

Angle's Olympic gold medal has frequently been incorporated into his professional wrestling persona. His personality varies depending on his alignment as a face or heel. As a face, Angle usually performs as a role model; but as a heel arrogantly uses his achievements to insult other people. He mixes aspects from his amateur wrestling background with his in-ring work, performing various suplexes, including the belly-to-back, German,[120] and belly-to-belly, as well as submissions, such as the rear naked choke[233] or the triangle choke.[120] He primarily performs two finishing maneuvers to end his matches: an Olympic slam, dubbed "Angle Slam", and an ankle lock.[1]

During Angle's entrances in WWE, it is common for fans to chant "you suck!" to the tune of his entrance music. The chants originated during Angle's feud with The Rock in February 2001, but gained popularity during his feud with Edge in 2002. The chants have become a trademark of Angle's persona, regardless if he is a face or heel.[234] The theme song was later adopted by UFC fighter Colby Covington.

Both Angle's pizza commercial and his time on WPGH-TV would be referenced on WWE television (the latter through the WWE Network show Ride Along), and his time with WPGH-TV would also make him an alumnus of WPGH-TV parent Sinclair Broadcast Group without having ever appeared for Sinclair-owned wrestling promotion Ring of Honor.[248][249]

Angle is a longtime fan of MMA, and has occasionally talked about his desire to compete.

In 2007, Sports Illustrated reported that Angle's name was found in the client database of a Florida wellness center suspected of being a front for distributing performance enhancing drugs.[276] The magazine alleged that Angle had received prescriptions for trenbolone (which is not approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration) and nandrolone, both anabolic steroids. Angle denied the allegations, commenting that his neck issues were well documented.[277] Angle only failed a drugs test under WWE's Wellness Policy because his prescription for nandrolone had expired.[278] Angle has been open about struggles with addiction to prescription pain medication. He claims that he developed an addiction to pain killers in 2003, and that his addictions got so out of control that at one point he was taking up to 65 extra-strength Vicodin per day.

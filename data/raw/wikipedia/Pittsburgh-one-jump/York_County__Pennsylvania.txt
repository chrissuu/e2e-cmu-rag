York County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 456,438.[2] Its county seat is York.[3] The county was created on August 19, 1749, from part of Lancaster County and named either after the Duke of York, an early patron of the Penn family, or for the city and county of York in England.

York County comprises the York-Hanover, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Harrisburg-York-Lebanon, Pennsylvania combined statistical area. It is in the Susquehanna Valley, a large fertile agricultural region in South Central Pennsylvania.

Based on the Articles of Confederation having been adopted in York by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, the local government and business community began referring to York in the 1960s as the first capital of the United States of America. The designation has been debated by historians ever since.[4] Congress considered York and the borough of Wrightsville on the eastern side of York County along the Susquehanna River as the nation's permanent capital before Washington, D.C., was selected.[5]

Bush in 1992 is the only Republican not to win a majority. The only real pockets of Democratic support are in the city of York, which has sent Democrats to the state house without interruption since 1985.

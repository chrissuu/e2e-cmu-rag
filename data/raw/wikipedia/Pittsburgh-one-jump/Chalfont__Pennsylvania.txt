Chalfont is a borough with home rule status in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 4,253 at the 2020 census. The borough is served by SEPTA Regional Rail's Lansdale/Doylestown Line at Chalfont station.

Chalfont is named after Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, England.[3] Chalfont was the home of William Penn's first wife, and William Penn is buried at Jordans Quaker Meeting House near Chalfont St Giles.

In 1720, Simon Butler bought over 150 acres of land, including the "Village of Chalfont." After the construction of his home and mill, Butler bought more than 400 more acres of land. Butler was a giant historical figure who acted as a legal and economic powerhouse in the area. After his death, the land was parceled to a number of people. Between then and 1901 Chalfont held several names, including Butler's Mill, Kungle's Tavern, Barndtsville, and Whitehallville. For many years, the most important building in the area was the tavern and public house, which has burnt down many times and now stands as Leonardo's Pizza. During the Victorian era in 1855, a train station was built along the newly constructed Doylestown Branch of the North Penn Railroad which helped the community grow and brought about the construction of the many Victorian-style houses.

In 1885, Chalfont established Forest Park. Forest Park began as a small picnic grounds with frequent live music. The construction of the train station assured the park's success. In time, the grounds grew to become a small amusement park where locals could enjoy rides, a large swimming pool built in the 1930s, music (including string bands in the 1940s), and a host for many company picnics. The park closed its doors forever in 1968.[4]

George Eckhart later owned the Butler's mill. After it burned in 1835, Eckhart rebuilt with a larger mill. Later, Eckhart's son Martin inherited the mill and his other son inherited the farm. Part of the farmland included woods of mostly oak locally known as Eckhart's Grove which was frequently used for dance parties, family gatherings, religious camp meetings and Sunday School picnics. Later, in 1885, the mill was owned by Philip B. Grove who leased it to Valentine B. Clymer and Matthew S. Cogan when it burned again and was never rebuilt. Another gristmill was built in 1793 not far from where Bulter's mill was first operated by men named Miller and Evans, later by Francis D. Hartzel. Two of Hartzel's sons succeeded him. After a fire in 1878, the mill was rebuilt and much of the machinery replaced. About 1761, Henry Lewis built a stone tavern operated by George Kungle during the Revolutionary period. Chalfont was known as Kungles Tavern. After Kungle, the tavern was later owned consecutively by James Morris, Lewis Morris, Abner Morris, then John Barndt from Tylersport. The village was then known as Barndtsville.

William Stevens had a store on the south bank of the West Branch Neshaminy Creek and opened a post office in 1845. Chalfont was then known as Whitehallville. In 1869, the North Penn changed the name of the station to Chalfont. Sometime before 1885, the farm inherited by Charles Eckhart was purchased by Isaac Funk. On 27 June 1885, Funk opened the Forest Park on the grounds of the Eckhart's Grove. Guest speakers were attorneys from Doylestown J. Freeman Hendricks and John D. James. Music was provided by the Chalfont Cornet Band. On 20 June 1778, detachments of George Washington's army passed through the West Branch Neshaminy Creek and the North Branch Neshaminy Creek as they travelled from their camp at Valley Forge to Monmouth.[5]

Neshaminy Creek and Pine Run pass through Chalfont.[5] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2), all land.

Halušky[a] are a traditional variety of thick, soft noodles or dumplings found in many Central and Eastern European cuisines under various local names.[1][2][3]

In Hungary it is very popular to put it in paprikash. It is also eaten with cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, egg custard, semolina and butter all throughout the country, while in Slovakia it is eaten with sheep's cheese and bacon or spinach.

The term halušky can refer to the dumplings themselves, or to a complete dish containing other ingredients. Typically the dish described is noodles with sauteed cabbage and onions.[4][5] Bryndzové halušky, which combines the noodles with a soft sheep's cheese, is one of the national dishes of Slovakia.[6][7][8] In certain regions of the Antalya Province in South Turkey, holuşka is made with larger dumplings than its counterparts in Central and Eastern Europe.[9]

A haluskar is a kitchen utensil used to drop batter into stock to create the noodles.[10]

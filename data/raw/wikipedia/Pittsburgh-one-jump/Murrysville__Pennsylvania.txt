Murrysville is a home rule municipality in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 21,006 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

The Haymaker Gas Well in Murrysville was the nation's first commercial natural gas well. For some time, it remained the largest commercial gas well in the world.[4] The well was drilled in 1878, and until a gas pipe line was attached to the well in 1883, approximately 35 million cubic feet of gas a day was released into the atmosphere, resulting in a total of about 60 billion cubic feet of natural gas released into the atmosphere from this single site[5] Murrysville was described in the first half of the 20th century as being "the center of a district dotted with gas wells, the first of which was bored in 1878; wild speculation in leases precipitated the open conflict known as the 'Haymaker Riots,' named for the speculator killed in one of them."[6]

Since 1933, Murrysville has had a "tree sign" spelling out the word "Murrysville". The trees were landscaped to grow and form the letters by local Boy Scouts. The sign is situated on a large hill as one enters the Municipality from the Murrysville–Monroeville border, near U.S. Route 22. In 1947, the sign was featured in "Ripley's Believe It Or Not" as the world's largest arboreal sign.[7] (It is no longer the world's largest).  The "Y" in the Murrysville sign points to the Haymaker Gas Well.

In 1977, Murrysville was designated the "Gateway to Westmoreland County" by Mayor Walt Dollman in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce.  In 2012, community leaders upgraded sign and landscaping elaborately at the main entrance at the Allegheny / Westmoreland border featuring this designation.  As is shown at the introduction of this page, the Gateway designation is featured on the official Seal of the Municipality.

Murrysville became a home rule municipality in August 1976, when its electorate voted for a charter.[8]

In the mid-1970s, as suburban growth began to occur, the community rapidly transitioned through three forms of government (township, borough, and home rule) and four legal name changes (Franklin Township, Franklin Borough, Murrysville Borough, and Municipality of Murrysville). Since 1976, it has operated under its Home Rule Charter as the Municipality of Murrysville.

On Dec. 6, 2023, Murrysville Council approved gas fracking beneath its two largest parks, Duff and Murrysville Community Park, over the objections of at least 174 residents who petitioned Council. No plan was presented for using the incoming money from the leases. Council member Jason Lemak pointed to fracking operations around the Beaver Run Reservoir  “We’re talking about parks, but there has been fracking going on for a long time below the water supply for us and 120,000 people,” he said.[16]

On Dec. 18, 2023, the Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County issued a mandatory water conservation order for Murrysville and others, including energy companies using water from the Beaver Run Reservoir for fracking, due to an ongoing drought.[17]  In the Department of Environmental Protection’s 2021 Climate Change Impacts Assessment, it is noted that precipitation patterns are expected to change over the next century. Those changes are likely to include more extreme and intense rainfall — something scientists already have reported noticing — and increased drier weather in between and drought, along with higher temperatures.[18] “In general, we expect worse drought over most of the U.S. as a result of human-caused warming, and Western Pennsylvania is no exception,” said Michael Mann, a professor and director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “Our Fragile Moment.” [19]

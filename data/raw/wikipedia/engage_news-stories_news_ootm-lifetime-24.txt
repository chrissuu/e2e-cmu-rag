During Spring Carnival weekend, four current and former Carnegie Mellon University faculty and staff were among the 68 generous individuals and couples inducted as lifetime members of the Order of the May. The Order is composed of donors with an unbroken string of annual gifts to Carnegie Mellon. Members are welcomed after three years of consecutive giving and lifetime members are inducted at 25 years of consecutive giving.
Lifetime members demonstrate an extraordinary level of commitment to CMU and its mission. Each year, new lifetime members are celebrated during Spring Carnival and Reunion Weekend surrounded by their fellow supporters and CMU leadership. And for faculty and staff lifetime inductees, the experience is doubly meaningful — their consistent support shows unwavering trust in the Tartan community they are a part of each day.
The 2024 lifetime inductees to the Order represent a range of schools, departments and disciplines. Recently retired faculty member Don Carter (CFA 1967) and his wife, Bea (DC 1969) know that consistent support is key to keeping CMU’s mission moving forward.
“Many may prefer to give occasionally, but dependable donations help stabilize the work, allowing for long-term, mission-based programs and projects,” Bea says.

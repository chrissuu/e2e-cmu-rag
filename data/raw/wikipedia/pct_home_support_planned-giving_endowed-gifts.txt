An endowment gift to The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust today provides a brighter picture for our future. When you make a donation to an endowment, you give a gift with both immediate and long-term benefits.
Endowment donations are invested. A portion of the annual income from the investment is used to address immediate needs at the Trust. The remaining funds are reinvested to ensure indefinite support.
An Example of How It Works
Longtime The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust supporters Charlie and Susan have two goals: First, they want to make sure the Trust continues to receive support after they are gone. Second, they want to create a lasting legacy for Charlie’s parents.
Charlie and Susan make a $25,000 donation to the Trust, which we invest, and each year, a portion of the income from the invested money will be used to support our mission in honor of Charlie’s parents. Plus, Charlie and Susan qualify for a federal income tax charitable deduction on their taxes.

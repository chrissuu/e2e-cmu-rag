The Southside Works is now home to Pins Mechanical , one of my new favorite nights out in the city. This all-in-one retrotainment center comes complete with a massive draft list, two-story slide to ride down between floors, arcade games, duckpin bowling, patio pong and much more.
I like to cap off my perfect night out here by hanging out at the Pins Patio Playground! Ride the giant seesaw, enjoy the fire pits or just enjoy hanging out and watching the crowds move around the South Side as the sun sets. This place rocks.

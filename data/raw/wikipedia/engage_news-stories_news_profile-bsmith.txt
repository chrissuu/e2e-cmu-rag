Today, he is the owner, chairman and CEO of Detroit Manufacturing Systems (DMS), a certified Minority Business Enterprise that builds more than 1.5 million large-scale products per year and employs roughly 1,500 people, primarily from under-resourced areas.
Bruce thoroughly enjoys working with his teams to implement technology to help processes on the floor, and his favorite part is helping enrich the lives of others.
“I love working on anything and everything that fundamentally improves the business and helps us better serve our customers,” he says. “I’m enthusiastic about building up our employees personally and professionally and watching them light up in response.”
Under Bruce’s leadership, DMS has built an empowering culture where employees are encouraged to be the boldest versions of themselves and have fun in the process.
“A casual observer might not understand the value of our playful nature, but our fun events, like our bocce ball and cornhole tournaments, are about getting our teammates to see each other as people,” Bruce says. “We aim to tear down walls and build bridges with each other to establish trust. This trust allows us to be better team players who make better decisions and, ultimately, better products for our clients.”
Along these lines, DMS separates employees into 16 houses, much like those in the Harry Potter franchise. Houses are comprised of salaried employees that are put together cross-functionally and given an annual budget to support a local charity of their choice, both financially and through volunteer hours.

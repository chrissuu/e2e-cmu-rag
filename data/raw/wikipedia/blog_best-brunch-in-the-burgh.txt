Muddy Waters Oyster Bar
Did someone say Oyster Bar? Yes, please! Muddy Waters Oyster Bar in East Liberty offers fresh shellfish and delicious Cajun food. Their menu boasts Po Boys, gumbo, alligator bits, French Quarter beignets, and more! Plus, I've heard bourbon, beer, and Champagne flow like the three rivers here.

Trombone
Paul J. Ross Fellow
Jacob Ogbu is a trombonist based in New York City, originally from Frisco, Texas. A passionate performer and collaborator, Jacob completed his studies at the Manhattan School of Music, where he trained under Colin Williams (New York Philharmonic) and Demian Austin (Metropolitan Opera). Within his time in New York, Jacob has had the pleasure of performing with ensembles including the New Jersey Symphony and the Color of Noize orchestra, sharing the stage with Grammy award-winning artists Derrick Hodge and Angélique Kidjo. In 2022, he was honored to premiere Jason Nitsch’s Dance Party at the Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic, performing with the Lone Star High School Band. Jacob discovered his love for music at age 11 through the euphonium, a journey that soon led him to the trombone and further into the world of music. In the summer of 2024, he was selected as a fellow at the Aspen Music Festival, studying with Dr. Per Brevig, Peter Sullivan, Tim Higgins, and James Miller. While there, he won the Brass Concerto Competition and performed Lars-Erik Larsson’s Concertino for Trombone and String Orchestra. He returns to Aspen in 2025 as the Chamber Symphony Fellow.

HSP Student Spotlight: Mo Fahad
Mo Fahad , a rising sophomore in Carnegie Mellon University’s Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and a member of the Humanities Scholars Program, studied abroad at Queen’s University Belfast through the Fulbright UK Summer Institutes. As part of the program, Fahad  delved into questions of identity, conflict and reconciliation in a region with a complex history.
“I saw Northern Ireland and immediately knew I had to apply,” he said. “I have a specific interest in Northern Ireland because I want to write a comparative paper on South Asia and Northern Ireland — how both regions were raised under British imperial rule and how that shaped their national identities and literature.”

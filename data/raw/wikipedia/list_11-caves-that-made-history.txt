Caves are simply openings in the earth. They can be natural or human-made. They may be of any size and shape. They often are part of larger systems of caves, and they can be found anywhere. But a select few have taken on greater meaning and significance in human history. Here are 11 of them.
Earlier versions of the descriptions of these caves first appeared in 1001 Amazing Places You Must See Before You Die , edited by Richard Cavendish (2016). Writers’ names appear in parentheses.
Mogao Caves
The Mogao Caves, or Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, encapsulate a millennium of Buddhist history. The site, on the ancient Silk Route , is near the Dunhuang oasis, for centuries a popular resting place for travelers, traders, wandering monks, and pilgrims. These human-made caves date to the 4th century CE.
It was not only expensive luxury items that were transported via the extensive Silk Route. Buddhism, along with its art and architecture, also made its way from India to China as traders moved across the continent. The caves served as a shelter for travelers, as cells in which to meditate, and as artists’ galleries. The iconography of the art discovered inside the Mogao Caves was inspired by Indian Buddhism, but the stylistic elements were changed as the religion moved into a new artistic region.
The caves’ wealth of artistic treasures include murals, clay sculptures, and priceless manuscripts. The Buddhist community encouraged patronage of the arts, and the emperors of the Tang dynasty (618–907) gave specific financial support to the caves, encouraging artists to work here; two colossal Buddha statues and mural paintings can be dated from that period. As a result of state patronage, the paintings in the caves also depict secular subjects such as the military exploits of Chinese rulers.
Despite the threat posed by invaders, the caves’ cultural legacy has miraculously survived, thanks to monks who hid the manuscripts and Tibetans who protected the site. In 1907, Daoist priest Wang Yuanlu revealed to archeologist Sir Aurel Stein a previously hidden “library cave,” which had been sealed a thousand years before. It contained about a thousand well-preserved ancient manuscripts, silk banners, paintings, rare textiles, and secular documents—in total some 50,000 documents in Khotanese, Tibetan, Chinese, Sanskrit, and Uighur.

Grotto of Massabielle
The Grotto of Massabielle—a simple, shallow cave—was made famous by St. Bernadette in the mid-19th century. Her visions of the Virgin Mary helped to turn the town of Lourdes in southwest France into a major pilgrimage center, attracting millions of visitors each year.
Marie-Bernadette Soubirous was a pious girl—the daughter of a penniless miller. In 1858, when she was just 14, she experienced a series of visions at the grotto . The Virgin spoke to Bernadette in the local dialect , instructing her to dig a hole in the ground. On doing so, the girl discovered a spring, which, she was told, could heal the sick. The church authorities questioned her closely, but they could not fault her account. As word of this apparent miracle spread, pilgrims and invalids began to flock to the site, seeking a remedy for their ailments. Bernadette retired to a convent where she spent the remainder of her short life, dying at the age of 35.
In 1862 the visions were officially acknowledged by the Roman Catholic Church , and the area developed rapidly in response to the burgeoning interest in the site. A statue of the Virgin, based on Bernadette’s description of the figure seen in her visions, was placed in the grotto in 1864. The Basilicas of the Immaculate Conception and Our Lady of the Rosary were erected for the huge influx of pilgrims, and the first national procession was staged in 1873.
The popularity of Lourdes continued unabated in the 20th century. Bernadette was canonized in 1933, albeit for her piety rather than her visions, and interest in her received fresh impetus from a film of her life. The Song of Bernadette (1943), which was an international success, earned the actress Jennifer Jones an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of the saint. (Iain Zaczek)
Lascaux Cave
In September 1940 four boys were playing in the woods near Montignac, France, when their dog disappeared down a hole. That hole turned out to be the entrance to a cave . Unwittingly, the friends had stumbled across Europe’s finest surviving collection of Paleolithic cave art . The cave at Lascaux is not unique—the Vézère valley alone contains 25 decorated caves—but the range and quality of the paintings are unparalleled .
Lascaux contains about 600 paintings and 1,500 engravings spread across a series of linked chambers. A high proportion of the images depict animals. The most spectacular examples are in the Great Hall of Bulls, which is dominated by four huge beasts measuring up to 18 feet (5.4 meters) long. The purpose of the paintings has been much debated. Many are in areas where they could never have been viewed properly, so their function seems to have been religious rather than decorative.
The cave was discovered during wartime, so a detailed examination of the site was delayed, but it was opened to the public in 1948. Record crowds came to see it—which rapidly became a problem. The humidity from the visitors’ breath, together with the dust and pollen on their shoes, caused a noticeable deterioration in the pictures. The cave was closed in 1963, and a facsimile was created inside a shell of reinforced concrete . Lascaux II opened in 1983 and has proved every bit as popular as the original. (Iain Zaczek)
Vardzia Cave City
In remote countryside near Aspindza, Georgia , rearing up magnificently from the banks of the Mtkvari River , lies a honeycomb of intriguing openings hewn from massive cliff faces of the Lesser Caucasus mountains. This is the external evidence of a vast cave city created here in the 12th century. The outer view, spectacular in itself, is as nothing compared with the ambition and scale of the city behind its rocky facade.
Close to the Turkish and Armenian borders, Vardzia was conceived as a military stronghold by Giorgi III, a Christian king of Georgia, at a time when Muslim invasions were an ever-present threat. It is said that the name “Vardzia” springs from a phrase that Princess Tamar, Giorgi’s daughter, called out to tell people where she was when she became lost in the caves. When Giorgi died in 1184, Tamar took over the project, turning it into a fortified monastery. As queen, she presided over a great era of Georgian power and culture , and Vardzia is a fitting expression of her vision—the best of its kind in a land known for its cave architecture.
At its height the city was considered a miraculous creation, its 13 tiers and thousands of rooms capable of housing 50,000 people. Here was a banquet hall, stables, libraries, bakeries, bathing pools, wine cellars, and a grand main church whose northern wall bears a famous fresco of Tamar and her father. A sophisticated irrigation system supplied water and fed terraced areas under cultivation. The late 1200s brought an earthquake that destroyed some of the city and exposed entrances once hidden from view, and the 1500s saw a plundering Persian attack that hastened the city’s demise . Over the centuries, this relatively inaccessible site went largely unnoticed, but efforts at restoration and promotion have raised its profile enormously. (Ann Kay)
Cave of the Apocalypse
On the small and rocky island of Pátmos, the Cave of the Apocalypse can be found deep within a monastery that surrounds and protects it. Rising up out of the crystal-blue Aegean Sea , Pátmos is the most northerly of a group of Greek islands, just off the southwest coast of Turkey. It is believed that St. John the Theologian (identified by early Christian tradition as John the Apostle ) lived here, halfway between the island’s two main towns of Khóra and Skála.
John the Apostle was exiled to Pátmos by the Roman emperor Domitian in 95 CE and stayed there for two years. During this period he lived in this small cave, where he reputedly dictated his Gospel and Apocalypse (or Revelation) to his disciple Prochorus, who later became Bishop of Nicomedia. The Apocalypse, with its disturbing revelations, has been the focus of controversy ever since, and it was the last book of the Bible to be written.
In the 10th century the cave on Pátmos was enclosed by a Greek Orthodox monastery to protect it physically and to guard its spiritual importance. It has been an important place of Christian pilgrimage ever since. The small area of the cave has hollows in the rock where St. John is thought to have rested his head and hand. At the entrance to the cave is a mosaic illustrating the visions received by the apostle while in the cave.
Although the veracity of the cave’s history cannot be established conclusively, it is a place that resounds with an intense spirituality and depth of feeling that makes its authenticity seem unshakeable. It forms one of the most historically important sites within the Christian world, and this significance was recognized in 1999 when it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Ajanta Caves
During the 1st or 2nd century BCE, caves began to appear at Ajanta in the district of Maharashtra in western India. The caves were deliberately carved out of the rock and divided into prayer halls, or chaitya , and monastic cells, or vihara . Already of great significance in the Buddhist world, the caves grew to further prominence between the 3rd and 6th century CE, when their location became part of an important trade route. Huge numbers of pilgrims, traders, artisans, and craftsmen traveled along the route, and Ajanta became an area where ideas and news were exchanged, thus aiding the spread of Buddhism beyond the Indian subcontinent .
The site of Ajanta, near Jalgaon, was rediscovered in 1819 by two British soldiers on a hunting expedition; the caves had been forgotten for centuries and were amazingly well preserved. Two distinct phases can be seen in the style of the paintings, sculptures, and frescoes of Ajanta. The early phase dates from c. 200 BCE and the later phase from the classical age of the Gupta dynasty (from the 4th to 6th century CE). Although Ajanta was patronized by Hindu courts, the site itself remains Mahayana Buddhist and includes a number of giant carved representations of the Buddha and of the Bodhisattva.
Secular and historic events are also depicted in the beautiful wall paintings, and there was a distinct attempt at realism by the artists. The carvings and paintings of people demonstrate classical Guptan conventions: the linear treatments of the human body , the narrow waists, the long black hair, the idealized shapes of the women, the full lips, the slender nose, and the lotus eyes. The rock-cut caves are strongly evocative and seem designed to guide visitors along a spiritual, as well as cultural, journey. (Sandrine Josefsada)
Ellora Caves
The Ellora Caves created in the Deccan Plateau near Aurangabad, India, have architectural similarities with other caves in the central Deccan region; they include 34 temples and monasteries dedicated to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. The Buddhist and Jain monasteries tend to be constructed on several stories and are divided into prayer halls and monastic cells. The Buddhist caves are decorated with Buddhas, bodhisattvas, mother goddesses, musicians, nymphs, guardian figures, and animals sculpted out of the rock. Plaster and natural pigments were used to embellish the icons. One of the most impressive structures (Cave 10) is laid out in a horseshoe shape and contains a pillared hall leading to a colossal seated Buddha enshrined in a stupa.
During the 9th century five Jain temples were constructed, including the magnificent Chota Kailash temple (Cave 16), the largest known rock-cut temple in the world. A sculpture of the seated Jain lord Mahavira Tirthankara is preserved in the Assembly Hall of Indra (Cave 32), one of the most stunning examples of Jain architecture in India.
The Hindu caves differ from the Jain and Buddhist caves by having higher ceilings and more variety of decorations and icons. Dating from the 8th century, the Hindu Kailasanatha temple attempts to replicate Mount Kailasa (the abode of Shiva and Parvati). The 6th-century Rameshvara cave-temple displays a relief of the demon Ravana shaking Mount Kailasa in order to annoy Shiva and Parvati. Although the Ellora Caves were created for three different religions, the style of the decorations, the structure of the architecture, and the symbolism of these monuments are analogous . The caves functioned as an area of meditation and helped the diffusion of these three religions. Images were, and arguably still are, the best way to communicate ideas. (Sandrine Josefsada)
Elijah’s Cave
Nestled in the foothills of Mount Carmel in northern Israel is a site where you are likely to see Jews, Christians, and Muslims worshipping in the same place. Elijah is traditionally seen as the prophet of wrath who isolated himself in deserts and mountains and hid in caves. This is the cave where the prophet Elijah allegedly sheltered when hiding from the king and queen of the period, Ahab and Jezebel, because he faced punishment for denouncing their idol worshipping. It is also believed that this is the site where Elijah later established a school for studying religion.
The cave—which was uncovered by excavations in the 1950s—houses a small altar and is overlooked by a Carmelite monastery constructed by the Christian religious order he inspired. Christians also believe that Jesus and his family sheltered in the same cave on their return from Egypt while escaping from King Herod.
From Elijah’s Cave there is a spectacular mountain view, an opportunity to witness the challenging conditions Elijah would have encountered to reach the cave. Thousands of pilgrims believe the cave has healing powers, and pilgrimages and dramatic ceremonies are held here throughout the year. The walls of the cave are covered in inscriptions made by the numerous pilgrims who visit the site, some dating from the 5th century. (Rachel Rouse)
Sterkfontein Caves
Part of the UNESCO World Heritage Cradle of Humankind site established in 1999, the six linked caves of Sterkfontein in South Africa have yielded some thrilling finds. The limestone caves—near the town of Krugersdorp, northwest of Johannesburg—were rediscovered in the 1890s by an Italian prospector, and later investigation showed that in the far-distant past the area was populated by sabre-tooth cats, long-legged hyenas, and giant monkeys. More important, the area was also inhabited by hominins—ancient creatures that were predecessors of modern humans.
The fossilized remains of hominins have been found in this dark underground labyrinth, which was investigated between 1936 and 1951 by Robert Broom of the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria. In 1936 Broom found fossils of the hominin species Australopithecus africanus , and in 1947 he discovered most of the skull of an adult australopith, though without the lower jaw and teeth, who lived an estimated 2.5 million years ago. He called it a Plesianthropus , and, thought to be a female, it was known familiarly as “Mrs. Ples.”
More was to come. In 1995 R.J. Clarke found four fossilized foot bones of a hominin christened “Little Foot,” which had both human and apelike characteristics and could walk upright and climb trees. He was convinced that the rest of the skeleton must be on the site, and in 1997 he and his helpers found the rest of the skeleton, including the complete skull, with its lower and upper jaws and teeth. It was quite a sizable creature and would have weighed 110 pounds (50 kg) or more. It had apparently fallen down a shaft more than three million years ago, landed facedown with its head resting on its left arm, its right arm by its side, and its legs crossed, and died. Productive excavations continue at Sterkfontein today. (Richard Cavendish)
Altamira Cave
Altamira , near Santillana del Mar, Spain, belongs to the Franco-Cantabrian belt of decorated caves, which extends from southwest France to northeast Spain. The cave itself had been found by a huntsman in 1868, but it was 11 years later that a five-year-old girl noticed the paintings. Her father, Marcelino de Sautuola , was the first to excavate the site and publish his findings. His claim that the paintings were Paleolithic was greeted with some skepticism . Some French archeologists even suggested that they were forgeries. Sautuola’s theories were eventually vindicated after his death.
The extraordinary paintings are mainly of animals. The finest ones depict bison, but deer, boars, and horses also appear. The artists used just three color pigments—ocher, red, and black—but managed to create remarkably realistic images, particularly in the texture of the manes and fur. The painters also used the uneven surface of the walls to give the animals a sense of volume. In common with the caves at Lascaux and elsewhere, conservation has been a major and ongoing headache. The cave was closed for a time in 1977 and then reopened five years later on a very limited basis. Prospective visitors are encouraged to visit one of the replicas of the cave. The first of these was produced by the Deutsches Museum in Munich (1962), but there is another version in Madrid (1964) and a more elaborate one near Altamira itself (2001). (Iain Zaczek)
Atapuerca Caves
A spectacular cave system near the Spanish town of Atapuerca has provided paleontologists with a rich fossil record of the earliest human beings in Europe. The findings have revealed priceless information about the appearance and way of life of our human ancestors, from almost one million years ago to the present day.
Located in ancient limestone caverns near Burgos, the discovery was fortuitously made when a railway cutting was driven through the site in the late 1890s. Several sites were subsequently excavated, but it was not until 1976 that the significance of Atapuerca was fully realized when a student discovered a human jawbone. Early human remains ranged from Homo erectus to Homo antecessor . Excavation work began in earnest , and the Sima de los Huesos (”Pit of Bones”) staked its place on the paleontologist’s map. Located at the foot of a 42-foot- (13-meter-) high chimney reached by scrambling through the Cueva Mayor cave system, the fossils of bears, wolves, and lions had a minimum age of 350,000 years. Among them were remains of about 30 skeletons—the largest hominin collection in the world—of the human species Homo heidelbergensis , a direct ancestor of the Neanderthals. A second site, Gran Dolina, revealed layers of sediment rich with fossils and stone tools of the earliest hominins dated between 780,000 and 1,000,000 years ago.
On a more grisly note, the earliest evidence of cannibalism in the human fossil record was also found. It is believed individuals were consumed under what is termed gastronomic cannibalism—not in a famine or as part of a ritual. These hominins are thought to be part of the first wave of early humans to penetrate the rugged terrain and harsh climates of western Europe 800,000 years ago. (Tim Evans)

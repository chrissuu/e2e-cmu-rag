Chemical Engineering
Every day, we use products formulated and produced by chemical engineers — food and fuel, paper and plastic, medicines and makeup. The process of reliably creating these — not just the ingredients — depends on the know-how of chemical engineers.
Our premier chemical engineering program fuses forward-looking education with real-world research opportunities. You’ll make use of problem-solving techniques to become well-versed in the principles of chemical engineering science and process systems engineering. Opportunities for internships, research and international experience paired with relevant electives will give your education depth and currency. The expertise you’ll develop in this broad discipline — rooted in chemistry, mathematics, physics and biology — will prepare you to develop new products and efficient manufacturing processes to improve the world we live in. Computing is integrated throughout the curriculum, so students are well equipped to solve complex problems drawn from chemical engineering practice.

How to calculate percent increase
Figuring out a percentage increase or decrease is useful in many situations, such as finding by what
                percentage your salary grew when you received a raise.
The calculator works by subtracting the starting value from the final value.
(Final value - Starting value)
That result is then divided by the absolute value of the starting value. (The absolute value of a
                number is its distance from zero. For example, the absolute value of -4 is 4.)
(Final value - Starting value) / |Starting value|
The new result is then multiplied by 100.
Percentage increase = [ (Final value - Starting value) / |Starting value| ] *
                100
If the final value is negative, there is a decrease between the starting and ending value.

Way before I knew what vegan cuisine even was, Sree's was providing a healthy lunch full of flavor to everyone who happened by their unassuming location Downtown. Friendly owners who will recognize you after one visit, authentic flavors, and a cheap price point. There's a reason Sree's is lined with people in business casual all afternoon.
$10 or under choice: Menu changes daily, but my favorite vegan options here are their cauliflower with tomato and butter beans, vegetable kofta and green beans curry. Tuesdays and Thursdays are samosa days (get there early)!

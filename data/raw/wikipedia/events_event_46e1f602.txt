Heinz Hall 600 Penn Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15222
Dreams turn to demonic nightmares. A march to the scaffold. A church bell tolls. Berlioz’s "Fantasy Symphony” descends from passion into madness across five vivid, soul-baring movements – an audience favorite that’s perfect for fall. Plus, Beethoven at his boldest with his Fourth Piano Concerto, performed by the spellbinding Francesco Piemontesi.

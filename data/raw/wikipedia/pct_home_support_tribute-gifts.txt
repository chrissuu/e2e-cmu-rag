Recognize Someone Special in your life!
Art impacts us in many ways from enjoying a night out to moments of pure joy and connection. Simply put art is everyone and drives life-long memories. Perhaps you have a great memories from growing-up and attending the theater with your grandparents or maybe you want to honor that friend of yours who really doesn't need a physical gift.
Allow us to celebrate to honor or memoralize your special someone in the Cultural District all season long.

Throughout its history, our program has maintained a deep commitment to offer children the highest quality of care and education. We recognize the potential of each child, the vital contributions parents make to the center community, and the importance of professional development for educators and staff. For more than 30 years, our program has engaged in serious study of the Reggio Emilia Approach. We are a social constructivist program which uses a developmentally appropriate, materials-rich negotiated curriculum that embraces the children’s right to learn and express their ideas, questions and theories in myriad ways.
The program is licensed by Pennsylvania's Department of Human Services and accredited through the National Association for the Education of Young Children. The kindergarten is also licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

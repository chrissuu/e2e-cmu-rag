The Illuminati is a name that has been applied to several groups since the 1400s. The most prominent of these organizations is generally referred to as the Bavarian Illuminati, a secret society of Enlightenment thinkers founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776. Weishaupt was a defrocked Jesuit and the Bavarian Illuminati adopted a structure that was similar to the hierarchy of the Jesuit order. Weishaupt and one of his early recruits, Adolf, Freiherr Knigge, also introduced the Masonic trappings that have come to characterize many secret societies. Although the Bavarian Illuminati became something of a fad for academics and minor nobles, the Bavarian government grew tired of its libertine antics and suppressed it in 1785.
What does the name illuminati refer to?
What does the name illuminati refer to?
Illuminati —the plural of the Latin word illuminatus , meaning “enlightened”—is a name that has been in use since the late 15th century and has been applied to various groups since then. Members of these groups claim to be unusually enlightened, with the “light” attributed to a higher source or to an exalted condition of the human intelligence. The doctrines, practices, and rituals of illuminati groups are generally shrouded in secrecy: the Bavarian illuminati adopted a cipher for communicating with each other, while the Rosicrucian order claimed to be bound to secrecy for 100 years from their foundation. The doctrines of these groups had a number of different ideological influences, including Christian gnosticism and Egyptian Hermeticism ; the Bavarian group wanted to create a religion of reason. They were generally met by censorship and resistance from the state. Many members of the Alumbrado movement in the early 16th century fell victim to the Inquisition , and the Bavarian group was eventually shut down by the government.

What are the origins of the illuminati?
Though the term illuminati has been most closely associated with the 18th-century movement of republican free thought in Bavaria , the word has in fact been in use since the late 15th century to refer to various groups. One of the early illuminati groups was the Alumbrados (“Enlightened Ones”), whose movement began in Spain in the 16th century and had ideological roots in gnosticism . A very early leader was María de Santo Domingo, a prophet and mystic who claimed to converse directly with Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary and was tried under the auspices of the Inquisition . Many Alumbrados later fell victim to the Inquisition, and St. Ignatius of Loyola was charged with having sympathies with the Alumbrado movement. Another early group associated with the illuminati was the Rosicrucians , who came to public attention in the early 16th century but claimed to go back to 1422. Much of what is known about them comes from their earliest extant text, Fama Fraternitatis , first published in 1614, which describes the journey of their founder, Christian Rosencreutz.

What was the Bavarian illuminati group?
The Bavarian illuminati group was a movement of republican free thought and is probably the most prominent group associated with the name illuminati . It was founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, professor of canon law at Ingolstadt and former Jesuit . Weishaupt wanted to replace Christianity with a religion of reason, and the members of his society called themselves “Perfectibilists.” The society was carefully structured and divided into three main classes. Weishaupt’s recruitment efforts spread across the cities of Bavaria, and he also made connections with a number of Masonic lodges, where his group often managed to gain a prominent position. The movement over time acquired a rigorously complex constitution and internal communication system, conducted in a cipher. At its zenith, the Bavarian illuminati operated in a very large area, extending from Italy to Denmark and from Warsaw to Paris. The movement was ultimately banned, and Weishaupt was stripped of his professorship at Ingolstadt. No evidence of the Bavarian order appears in the historical record after 1785.

Who are some notable members of illuminati groups?
Adam Weishaupt of the Bavarian illuminati targeted people of wealth and social importance when he was spreading his doctrine, and a number of notable figures are associated with the Bavarian movement. Literary giants Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried von Herder , as well as a number of dukes, were claimed as members of the Bavarian society, though how much they were actually involved is disputed. Weishaupt’s illuminati were also believed to have included astronomer Johann Bode , writer and bookseller Friedrich Nicolai , philosopher Friedrich Jacobi , and poet Friedrich Leopold, Graf zu Stolberg-Stolberg . Additionally, the British philosopher Francis Bacon was connected to the earlier Rosicrucian order, while St. Ignatius of Loyola was associated with the Alumbrado movement.
illuminati , designation in use from the 15th century, assumed by or applied to various groups of persons who claimed to be unusually enlightened . The word is the plural of the Latin illuminatus (“revealed” or “enlightened”).
Early illuminati
According to adherents, the source of the “light” was viewed as being directly communicated from a higher source or due to a clarified and exalted condition of the human intelligence . To the former class belong the Alumbrados (Spanish: “enlightened”) of Spain . Spanish historian Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo first finds the name about 1492 (in the form aluminados , 1498) but traces them back to a gnostic origin and thinks their views were promoted in Spain through influences from Italy . One of their earliest leaders—indeed, some scholars style her as a “pre-Alumbrado”—was María de Santo Domingo, who came to be known as La Beata de Piedrahita. She was a labourer’s daughter, born in Aldeanueva, south of Salamanca , about 1485. She joined the Dominican order as a teenager and soon achieved renown as a prophet and mystic who could converse directly with Jesus Christ and the Virgin . Ferdinand of Aragon invited her to his court, and he became convinced of the sincerity of her visions. The Dominicans appealed to Pope Julius II for guidance, and a series of trials were convened under the auspices of the Inquisition . Her patrons, which by then included not only Ferdinand but also Francisco Cardenal Jiménez de Cisneros and the duke of Alba , ensured that no decision was taken against her, and she was cleared in 1510.
St. Ignatius of Loyola , while studying at Salamanca (1527), was brought before an ecclesiastical commission on a charge of sympathy with the Alumbrados, but he escaped with an admonition . Others were not so fortunate. In 1529 a congregation of unlettered adherents at Toledo was visited with scourging and imprisonment. Greater rigours followed, and for about a century the Alumbrados afforded many victims to the Inquisition, especially at Córdoba .
The movement (under the name of Illuminés ) seems to have reached France from Seville in 1623. It attained some prominence in Picardy when joined (1634) by Pierre Guérin, curé of Saint-Georges de Roye, whose followers, known as Guerinets, were suppressed in 1635. Another body of Illuminés surfaced in the south of France in 1722 and appears to have lingered till 1794, having affinities with those known contemporaneously as “French Prophets,” an offshoot of the Protestant militant Camisards .
Of a different class were the Rosicrucians , who claimed to have originated in 1422 but achieved public notice in 1537. Their teachings combined something of Egyptian Hermetism , Christian gnosticism, Jewish Kabbala , alchemy , and a variety of other occult beliefs and practices. The earliest extant writing which mentions the Rosicrucian order was the Fama Fraternitatis , first published in 1614 but probably circulated in manuscript form somewhat earlier than this. It recounts the journey of the reputed founder of the movement, Christian Rosenkreuz , to Damascus , Damcar (a legendary hidden city in Arabia), Egypt , and Fès , where he was well received and came into possession of much secret wisdom. He returned finally to Germany , where he chose three others to whom he imparted this wisdom and thus founded the order. Later the number was increased to eight, who separated, each going to a separate country. One of the six articles of agreement they adopted was that the fraternity should remain secret for 100 years. At the end of 120 years the secret burial place and the perfectly preserved body of the founder were discovered by one of the then members of the order, along with certain documents and symbols held in very high esteem by Rosicrucians. The sacred vault was re-covered, the members of the order dispersed, and the location of the vault was lost to history. The Fama ends with an invitation to “some few” to join the fraternity. Among those believed to have been associated with the order were German alchemist Michael Maier , British physician Robert Fludd , and British philosopher and statesman Sir Francis Bacon .
Perhaps the group most closely associated with the name illuminati was a short-lived movement of republican free thought founded on May Day 1776 by Adam Weishaupt , professor of canon law at Ingolstadt and a former Jesuit . The members of this secret society called themselves “Perfectibilists.” Their founder’s aim was to replace Christianity with a religion of reason , as later did the revolutionaries of France and the 19th-century positivist philosopher Auguste Comte . The order was organized along Jesuit lines and kept internal discipline and a system of mutual surveillance based on that model. Its members pledged obedience to their superiors and were divided into three main classes: the first included “novices,” “minervals,” and “lesser illuminati”; the second consisted of freemasons (“ordinary,” “Scottish,” and “Scottish knights”); and the third or “mystery” class comprised two grades of “priest” and “regent” as well as “magus” and “king.”
Beginning with a narrow circle of disciples carefully selected from among his own students, Weishaupt gradually extended his recruitment efforts from Ingolstadt to Eichstätt, Freising , Munich , and elsewhere, with special attention being given to the enlistment of young men of wealth, rank, and social importance. From 1778 onward Weishaupt’s illuminati began to make contact with various Masonic lodges, where, under the impulse of Adolf Franz Friedrich, Freiherr von Knigge , one of their chief converts, they often managed to gain a commanding position, It was to Knigge that the society was indebted for the extremely elaborate constitution (never, however, actually realized) as well as its internal communication system. Each member of the order had given him a special name, generally classical , by which he alone was addressed in official writing (Weishaupt was referred to as Spartacus while Knigge was Philo ). All internal correspondence was conducted in cipher , and to increase the mystification, towns and provinces were invested with new and altogether arbitrary designations .
At its period of greatest development, Weishaupt’s “Bavarian Illuminati” included in its operations a very wide area, extending from Italy to Denmark and from Warsaw to Paris ; at no time, however, do its numbers appear to have exceeded 2,000. The order and its doctrines appealed to literary giants such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried von Herder as well as the dukes Ernest II of Gotha and Charles Augustus of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach . Such notables were claimed as members although it is questionable if they were actually so. Weishaupt’s illuminati were believed to have included astronomer Johann Bode , writer and bookseller Friedrich Nicolai , philosopher Friedrich Jacobi , and poet Friedrich Leopold, Graf zu Stolberg-Stolberg .
Secret societies of this kind fitted in with the idea of benevolent despotism as a vehicle for the Enlightenment , as Goethe shows in Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship . The movement suffered from internal dissension and was ultimately banned by an edict of the Bavarian government in 1785. Some members were imprisoned, while others were driven from their homes. Weishaupt was stripped of his chair at Ingolstadt and banished from Bavaria. After 1785 the historical record contains no further activities of Weishaupt’s illuminati, but the order figured prominently in conspiracy theories for centuries after its disbanding. It was credited with activities ranging from the instigation of the French Revolution to the assassination of U.S. Pres. John F. Kennedy , and the notion of an all-knowing cabal of ancient masters remained a powerful image in the popular consciousness into the 21st century.

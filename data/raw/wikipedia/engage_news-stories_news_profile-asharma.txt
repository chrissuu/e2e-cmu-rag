Lighting up the future of clean energy
When Abhi joined Amazon in 2014, clean energy sources weren’t easily available in all regions across the globe.
In many markets, Amazon had to foster the development of a clean energy source from the ground up.
Abhi’s job is to work with global energy companies to develop those sustainable sources from solar and wind projects located near AWS operations worldwide.
His mix of energy trading sophistication, technical know-how and ability to reach across business functions helps him bring new technologies online on a large scale.
The complexity of his day-to-day tasks goes well beyond the engineering side of power and focuses on addressing clean energy concerns related to regulation, legal aspects, financing and policy.
Contending with these challenges often requires Abhi to invent new commercial arrangements and work with power developers from small to large multinational utilities in regions like Asia, Europe and Africa to provide clean energy to AWS.
“We have announced over 400 clean energy projects that once fully operational will produce enough clean electricity to power over 5.6 million U.S. homes,” he says. “Only a handful of companies globally have invested more than Amazon has in clean energy to help fight climate change.”
Aging infrastructure, market regulations and ever-changing policies ensure Abhi has plenty of challenges while advancing Amazon’s goal, but it’s worth it.
“We’re doing it for our children,” he says. “One of the most meaningful things about the space I'm in is helping add clean energy to energy grids globally.
“I’m playing a small role, so that our children will have a better environment. I’m helping to fight climate change. It's very humbling to be able to do that at scale.”

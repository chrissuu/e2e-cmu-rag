“The campus community, the team-based structure, the focus on analytics: All of these factors were unique at the time and felt to me like a program that was looking ahead to the future and what its students would need to be successful,” Steve says. “Given my career in tech and in startup businesses, the Carnegie Mellon program was exactly what I was looking for.”
After leaving campus, his career path led him back to Silicon Valley where he eventually found his niche as a product marketing manager. He was one of the first 20 employees at Eightfold AI, a talent intelligence platform that uses artificial intelligence to connect people and jobs. Now, with 600 employees, he’s the director of customer advocacy.
“I've had the opportunity to define a whole market, and the remarkable experience as a marketer of seeing my work copied all over the world,” Steve says. “You can’t ask for anything better than that.”
Looking ahead, he hopes his fellowship and his annual support of Tartans as a member of the Andrew Carnegie Society eventually will come full circle.
“My gifts are providing critical education for students who will be making their own hires someday,” Steve says. “That's how I think about the impact my gift can have. My gift is going to create jobs, technologies and businesses that we're all going to need in the years ahead to solve the challenges that will affect us all.”

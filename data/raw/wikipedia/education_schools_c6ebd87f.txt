Opera Trunks are large, colorful steamer trunks on wheels filled with books, costumes, music, and lesson activities—all the materials needed to introduce opera. Trunk package includes orientation, transportation, one month trunk residency, and a presentation by teaching artists at the residency location. If students can’t come to the opera, we take the opera to them!

Bringing visionaries together to make the impossible, possible
CMU’s legacy of impact is made possible through innovative and collaborative partnerships with industry, foundations, government, and passionate individuals, as well as a strong spirit of philanthropy that’s woven into every part of the university’s past, present and future.
Making history in humanities and social sciences.
Trustee and philanthropist William S. Dietrich II pledges $265 million to Carnegie Mellon in 2011. It is the largest single gift from an individual in CMU’s history and H&SS is renamed in his mother’s honor.
Bringing business to the forefront.
With a $55 million gift from David Tepper, the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA) becomes the Tepper School of Business in 2004. Nine years later, he makes an additional $67 million gift to build the David A. Tepper Quadrangle, which opens in 2018.
Inspiring others to give.
Alumnus Albert C. May founds the Annual Fund in 1947 and contributes every year until his death in 1998. CMU's Order of the May is named in his honor.
Believing in the Transformative Power of Education.
Andrew Carnegie's profound belief in the transformative power of education leads him to found the Carnegie Technical Schools in 1900 with a $1 million endowment. It evolves into Carnegie Mellon University in 1967 after merging with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research.

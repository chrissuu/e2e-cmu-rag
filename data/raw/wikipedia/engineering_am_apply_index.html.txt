Admissions
Applications and admission decisions to MSAM are managed independently from the other College of Engineering programs and departments.
Application Requirements:
Prospective students must be a graduate of a related discipline at a recognized university with better than a "B" average. Admission is based on overall academic performance and potential.
A completed application will include the following:
Non-refundable application fee of $75 USD
The online application form
Three letters of recommendation
Uploaded unofficial transcripts (Official transcripts will be requested upon admission)
Essay Questions
CV/Resume
GRE test scores
TOEFL test scores (if applicable)
Applicants who are non-native English speakers may only be considered for a TOEFL waiver if they attended and completed a four-year undergraduate program at a university within the United States.
The Graduate Admissions Committee thoroughly reviews each complete application and considers each applicant exclusively for the degree program to which they have applied. To be considered for a different degree program, applicants must reapply to that program. Applicants already accepted into a program, must also reapply to be considered for a different program.

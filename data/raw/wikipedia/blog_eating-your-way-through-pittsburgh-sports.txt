How do you make the American classic, the corndog, any better? You incorporate Doritos and pretzels. An order of Doritos Corn Dog Pretzels at Acrisure Stadium , home to the Pittsburgh Steelers , includes two freshly battered corn dogs, coated with crushed Doritos and topped with nacho cheese and scallions, on a bed of Doritos.
If you’re craving pizza, check out Franco’s Pizzeria, which features three Steelers’ themed pies: The Immaculate Pie, Gina Margarita & PeppeRooney Pizza. If beer isn’t your preferred beverage, Acrisure Stadium features a diverse wine selection at the North Shore Winery stand.
Also worth checking out at Acrisure are the Potato Patch Fries just like Kennywood does 'em (Section 106), Pierogi House for a Pittsburgh staple (Section 119) and the spicy chicken & waffle sandwich (Club seats).
Pro Tip: Use the Steelers Official Mobile App to order your next beer or snack so you can skip the line, pick-up by scanning your bar code and be back in your seat before you can say Franco's Italian Army.

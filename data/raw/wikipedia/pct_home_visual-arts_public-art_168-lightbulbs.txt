168 Lightbulbs
Jim Campbell, 2001
Commissioned by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust in conjunction with his solo exhibition Time + Data at Wood Street Galleries, 168 Lightbulbs is a permanent public artwork by renowned media artist Jim Campbell. Using a matrix of 168 LED lights, Campbell created a low-resolution portrait that shifts from abstract light patterns into the recognizable image of Claude Shannon—the pioneering engineer and mathematician widely considered the father of information theory. The work pays direct homage to Shannon, whose groundbreaking contributions deeply influenced Campbell’s practice and ongoing exploration of data, perception, and the limits of visual representation.
168 Lightbulb s exemplifies Campbell’s distinctive approach to time-based, light-driven media and can be viewed on the exterior of Wood Street Galleries in downtown Pittsburgh.

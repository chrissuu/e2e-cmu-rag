Abigail Lannan is a professional euphonium player, music teacher and content creator who uses her online persona, “The Goofy Euph,” to bring positivity, kindness and self-love to a musical audience.
She filmed her first YouTube video as a student at the School of Music following a conversation with her advisor, the late Lance LaDuke. She says Lance was pivotal in encouraging her to branch out, pursue her interests and find joy in making music.
It’s an important lesson that she’s teaching to her own students, and sharing with musicians everywhere through her fun online content.
“I want any musician, of any age, who's ever picked up an instrument before, to continue to be inspired to make music. No matter what,” Abigail says.
Lance LaDuke was an associate teaching professor in euphonium and music entrepreneurship at the School of Music from 2003 until his passing in 2023. Read about Lance's Legacy .

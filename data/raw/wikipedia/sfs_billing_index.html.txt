Billing & Payments
The Student Accounts Office manages the student billing and payment process, and The HUB serves as the front-facing center for related inquiries and services for students and families.
Invoices are generated on the last day of each month. When an invoice is ready for viewing on Student Information Online (SIO) , an email notification is sent to the student's Andrew email account. Also, within SIO, students may view their most up-to-date student account balance and activity, register for Online Banking and electronic refunds, and invite other individuals to view their information or make payments on their behalf.
Financial Hardship?
If you are experiencing a financial hardship or are in need of financial assistance, we are here to help. Your HUB liaison is available to provide individualized counsel and support .
Other Authorized Payers
If invited by a student, parents, family members, bill payers or other individuals can view student account invoices and activity, as well as make payments to the student's account.
Students may authorize parents, family members or other bill payers to receive an email with a PDF attachment of their monthly student account invoice for immediate access.
For students whose educational expenses are paid for by a sponsor (entity, government or third-party). View information regarding authorization forms, deadlines and billing.

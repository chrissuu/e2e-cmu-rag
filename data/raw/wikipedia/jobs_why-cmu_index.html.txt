Why Carnegie Mellon?
Innovation, Arts and Impact
Carnegie Mellon was founded in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie under the premise that a school established to foster and develop the technical skills of its students would soon produce students and graduates whose work would astound Pittsburgh and the world. Over 120 years later, our institution continues to produce talented alumni and draws faculty and staff eager to be a part of the university's creative, passionate and close-knit community. We place emphasis on practical problem solving, interdisciplinary learning, an entrepreneurial spirit, and collaboration.
In his letter to the mayor of Pittsburgh establishing Carnegie Technical Schools, Andrew Carnegie wrote, "My heart is in the work." Today, the students, faculty and staff of Carnegie Mellon University continue to live and work by these words.

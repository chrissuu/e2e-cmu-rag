Faculty Senate
In accordance with normal practice at major institutions of higher education in the United States, the professionals constituting the faculty bear a primary responsibility for all matters of educational and research policy and of academic freedom. As a means of discharging this responsibility, a chief purpose of the Faculty Organization is to examine these matters and formulate recommendations to the president and other appropriate persons. With a view to the institution's continued success and improvement, the Faculty Organization also has the prerogative of considering any other topic relevant to the interests of the university as well as any topic affecting the welfare of the university community, and to make recommendations thereon. The Faculty Organization also conducts those academic affairs that are delegated to it by the president or by the Board of Trustees. The representative assembly of the Faculty Organization is the Faculty Senate. The Faculty Senate is empowered to conduct all the affairs of the Faculty Organization except for those otherwise specified the Constitution and its Bylaws.

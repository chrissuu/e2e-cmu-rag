Tips for Photos for Promotional Purposes
All events require high-quality, high-resolution photography for email newsletters, calendar listings and social postings. Here are some tips for sharing the best photos with our team:
The best file size is more than 2MB and larger is ideal.
Do not resize or resample the photo before submitting. Our team can crop, adjust and edit, as needed.
If you are transferring photos from your phone, transfer at the highest resolution possible or “original.”
Do not send a photo that has come from a text. Text messaging compresses photos.
If the photo is online, please try to acquire the original photo. Photos, specifically headshots, are hard to resize if they are pulled from a website due to photo compression.
For a physical photo, you can use your phone to take a photo of the photo (one at a time), or use a scanner (set to photograph/picture mode) and send multiples.
Send each as an individual file.
Do not insert photos into a Word or PowerPoint file.
Do not send photography of which you don’t know the source. If it is stock, or suspected of being stock, our team cannot use it.
Worried the files are too large to email? No worries! It’s a good indication that they’re high resolution. Share them in a Box in your Monday request.

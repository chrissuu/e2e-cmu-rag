Hong Kong, 1967. Best friends Ben (Tony Leung), Frank (Jacky Cheung), and Paul (Waise Lee) are living carefree, aimless lives of the young, all trying to figure out their place in the world. Ben decides to marry his sweetheart, Jane (Fennie Yuen), and settle down, but life has other plans. On his wedding night, the three friends kill a local loan shark and, with his gang after them, they flee for Vietnam, where they seek quick money working the black market. But war gets in the way and they soon find themselves unwelcome foreigners in a wartorn country, unable to get back home. They take on a risky job pulling a robbery with local C.I.A.-backed hitman, Luke (an unforgettable Simon Yam), and escape into the jungle, where they're thrown into a war not just between countries and ideologies but ultimately each other, one where loyalties are betrayed and sacrifices leave scars that will never heal.
The Hong Kong Cinema Classics program is presented by Shout! Factory and GKIDS.

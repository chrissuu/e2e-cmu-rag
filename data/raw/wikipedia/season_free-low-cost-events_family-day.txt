Each Family Day event consists of different activities designed to expose children, teens, and their families to some of the many different components that make up opera.
Family Day opens with a 30-minute concert featuring our Resident Artists. This concert is not open to the general public and is only for Family Day attendees.
Here are a few examples of activities from our last Family Day event celebrating Madama Butterfly :
Origami – Learn the Japanese art of paper folding and make your very own creation!
Voice Lesson – A voice lesson led by a member of Pittsburgh Opera. Children will learn about different voice types, how to use proper breath support, how to project their voices, and more.
Fukuwarai – Play a traditional Japanese New Year’s celebration game that is a bit like pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and definitely just as silly and fun!
Costume Activity – Make your very own accessories – butterfly headbands or Pikachu ears! – to finalize your look and get ready to go out on stage.
Participants will rotate throughout the four activities. Each participant and group will participate in all four activities. There is no minimum age to attend. Parents/guardians must accompany children younger than high school age, so they can enjoy the activities with their children. Each family will receive a free goody bag at the end of the event.

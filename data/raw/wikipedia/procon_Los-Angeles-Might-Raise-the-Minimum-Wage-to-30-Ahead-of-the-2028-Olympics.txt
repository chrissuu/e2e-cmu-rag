ProCon Debates: Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased? ; Is Hosting the Olympics Worth the Cost?
ProCon Issues in the News: The City of Los Angeles passed an ordinance on May 23, 2025, that would incrementally but rapidly increase the minimum wage for hotel and airport employees ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics , which will be hosted by the city.
The minimum wage for hotel workers (at hotels with at least 60 rooms) is already higher than what other Los Angeles workers receive ($21.01 per hour as of July 1, 2025, compared with $17.87 for the city at large). Similarly, fast food workers receive a $20.00 minimum wage, as of April 1, 2024.
In consideration of the increased tourism expected with the 2028 Games, Ordinance No. 188610 would raise minimum wage rates for hotel and airport workers on the following schedule:
Also, if the employer does not offer health insurance , employees would be paid the mandated minimum wage plus an additional rate in compensation.
However, the ordinance was suspended on June 27, 2025, because a petition was filed by Los Angeles residents. The city clerk now has to verify all 140,774 signatures to the petition. If enough (92,998) signatures are deemed valid, then city council must take one of three actions: repeal the ordinance, submit the ordinance to voters during an election within 110 days of certification, or refer the ordinance to a department for an impact report, after which one of the two preceding actions must be taken.
Although the rate hike would coincide with a potentially record-breaking influx of tourists, Los Angeles has seen tourism drop dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic , further intensifying the tug-of-war between businesses trying to stay afloat and employees trying to pay rent in one of the most expensive U.S. cities.

Our hands-on learning programs for students K-12 are teacher friendly, address academic standards and use art, history, and nature to understand different times and contexts.  Frick programs address cross curricular standards, integrating writing, art, science and even economics to broaden student perspectives.
If you're interested in bringing your students to The Frick, our 2025-2026 School Programs Booklet is the best place to start the planning process. The booklet contains all of the information you need to plan an exciting, engaging field trip for your students, including program descriptions by grade level, lunch information, and tips for booking. By popular demand, we have also added an a la carte option that allows you to customize your own field trip experience! Download your free copy below.
If you plan to visit the Frick as a self-guided student group, please review our museum guidelines for self-guided groups ahead of your arrival.

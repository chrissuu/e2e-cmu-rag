An Inspiring Resurgence
At Carnegie Mellon, one class solidified her ideas about racial solidarity and transnational movements: Professor of History Nico Slate’s course The Civil Rights Movement and the World.
During the class, she learned the histories of marginalized people, like Indian social reformer Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, who rose up and fought for change. These histories impacted her deeply and led her toward the path of labor and worker organizing.
Slate is thrilled his course helped Vivian find a fulfilling career.
"It's so wonderful to see all that Vivian has done and is doing with her knowledge and many talents,” Slate says. “I'm so happy for her and am deeply moved by her commitment to fighting for a better, more just, and more equitable country."
What Vivian loves about the work — and about organizing as a career — is that it’s creative. She cites vaccine sign-ups and virtual fundraising cook-a-longs with AAPI chefs as examples.
In the four years she’s been involved with civic engagement work, Vivian has seen improvements in workers’ conditions.
“It’s a great time to be in this field. I feel lucky to see a resurgence in the success of workers,” Vivian says. “People are making headlines talking about class disparity and class consciousness. Policy change often opens a door, but what pushes people through the door is seeing the news of effective change.”

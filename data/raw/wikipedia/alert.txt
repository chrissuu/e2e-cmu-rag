Welcome to CMU-Alert, Carnegie Mellonâ€™s emergency notification service. In the event of an emergency, the system will send text, voice and email messages to members of the CMU community. Messages are posted to Facebook and Twitter for parents, alumni and community members. Messages and updates also are posted on this website.
All students are automatically registered for CMU-Alert using the contact information that has been entered into Student Information Online , so please make sure your information is up-to-date. Faculty and staff receive CMU-Alert messages to their contact information listed in Workday .
CMU-Alert notifications are for urgent, real-time emergencies. They will be sent via multiple modes of communication and are time-sensitive. These notifications are different than Safety or Crime Alerts, which are defined below:
Safety Alerts : Provide a timely notification to our community about reported incidents in the area surrounding campus. CMU Safety Alerts are sent to the entire Pittsburgh campus.
Crime Alerts : Provide a timely notification to our community about reported incidents on campus. CMU Crime Alerts are also sent to the entire Pittsburgh campus.

What should I do when I receive an alert?
Follow the directions of CMU-Alert messages unless doing so will place you in greater danger. CMU-Alert warnings are intended to support decisions for personal safety. When you become aware of a warning, make sure others around you are also aware of the potential danger. DO NOT respond to the scene of an emergency unless directed to do so. In addition to the possibility of becoming injured, your presence could interfere with the work of emergency response personnel.
How can I keep CMU-Alert messages from being marked as spam?
It is recommended that you list the CMU-Alert number, 412-268-ALRT , in your cellphone as a contact, and white-list the number in any third-party spam-identification applications such as Hiya, NoMoRobo, and Robokiller. In most cases, this should prevent an erroneous "Spam Risk" identification from appearing on your cellphone.

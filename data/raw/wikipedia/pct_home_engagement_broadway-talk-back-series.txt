Broadway Talk Back Series
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Strategic Partnerships and Community Engagement department proudly presents the Broadway Talk Back Series! On select days, immediately following the performance, grab a seat up close, and join us for a lively post-show discussion with cast and/or members of the show’s creative team. You don’t want to miss this fantastic opportunity to dive deeper into your Broadway experience.
Broadway Talk Backs are free to attend with the purchase of a ticket for specific performances.

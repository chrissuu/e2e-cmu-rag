Schedule an Appointment With the Advising Center
The CPDC is open for both in-person and virtual (Zoom) scheduled appointments with CPDC staff and Career Consultants. We are open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and located in West Wing (2nd Floor).
REMINDER > Check your Handshake messages and/or Andrew inbox leading up to your scheduled appointment date/time. Your consultant will be sending important instructions and information about your appointment. * Note: If you are scheduled for an in-person appointment and not feeling well, PLEASE reach out to your Career Consultant (via Handshake or email) and either reschedule or change the format of your meeting.
We look forward to meeting with you!

When people talk about giving marijuana to pets , they are really talking about the use of CBD products derived from hemp . The California Veterinary Medical Board explains that CBD is the “abbreviation for cannabidiol , which is one out of 60 naturally occurring compounds present in cannabis . It is the second-most prevalent cannabinoid in both hemp and marijuana and is nonpsychoactive .” CBD extracted from hemp contains less than 0.3% THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is the compound in marijuana that causes the high. [1]
THC is toxic for cats and dogs even in small amounts. The ASPCA’s Animal Poison Control Center reported a 765% increase in calls regarding animals ingesting marijuana from 2018 to 2019. And, “beginning in 2019, [they] noted a large jump in calls about pets eating weed (marijuana.) In fact, in the first couple of months of that year, APCC reported a 765 percent increase over a 10-year period.” [27]
In 2020 pet owners spent about $99 billion on their furry friends, a growth of 12 times over 2019 as more people worked from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The market for CBD products aimed at companion animals jumped from $32 million in 2018 to $400 million in 2019. During the pandemic, 2020 sales rose to $426 million.. [2] [3] [34] [35]
A survey found that 11% of dog owners and 8% of cat owners gave CBD to their pets in 2019, often in the form of pet treats, tinctures administered under the tongue, and salves or creams applied topically. By 2023 29% of pet owners gave CBD to their pets. Reasons cited for giving CBD to companion animals included caring for aging pets and treating conditions such as anxiety, pain, and seizures. [7] [8] [9] [5]
Pro 1: A majority of veterinarians agree that CBD helps animals.
A Veterinary Information Network survey found that 79% of vets with clinical experience using cannabis products said CBD was somewhat or very helpful for chronic pain in animals; over 62% said it was helpful for managing anxiety. Over 80% of those vets said there were no reports of adverse effects aside from sedation. [11]
A study published in Frontiers in Veterinary Science found that 82.2% of veterinarians agreed or strongly agreed that there are medicinal uses of CBD products for dogs from a medical standpoint. [10]
CBD is “100% non-toxic. You can’t overdose on CBD. It might make pets sleepy, but there’s no toxicity,” according to Jeffrey Judkins, holistic veterinarian at Animalkind Veterinarian Clinic. Judkins reported success in using CBD to alleviate pain and anxiety in animals, stating, “Recently I was able to significantly reduce the amount of a narcotic pain drug a dog was being given (with adverse side effects) by substituting a cannabis product.” [12] [13]
Pro 2: Studies about CBD use in pets have had positive results.
A clinical trial found that 89% of dogs who were given CBD oil experienced fewer seizures. Researchers at Cornell University who performed a double-blind crossover trial on dogs with osteoarthritis found “a significant decrease in pain and increase in activity” with CBD oil. There were no observed side effects from the CBD treatment. Studies on laboratory animals have shown benefits for cardiovascular health, the respiratory system, and cancer and pain treatment. [19] [20] [21]
While experts acknowledge that research in this area is preliminary, they speak positively about the results to date.
“We saw a correlation between how high the levels of CBD were in these dogs with how great the seizure reduction was. It’s really exciting that perhaps we can start looking at CBD in the future as an alternative to existing anticonvulsive drugs,” says Stephanie McGrath, neurologist at Colorado State University’s James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital. [22]
Pro 3: Pet owners report success in treating their animals with CBD.
Many pet owners swear by the use of CBD to treat ailments such as anxiety, pain, digestive issues, and inflammation. Their positive experiences are reflected in the growing market for CBD pet products. The industry was estimated at $400 million in 2019 and could jump to $1.7 billion by 2023. [3] [26]
A study of people who gave their dogs CBD found that less than 5% reported any side effects, and the most common side effect was lethargy (a lack of energy). [10]
Joshua Hartsel, chemist and CEO of Delta-9 Technologies, states that since all mammals have an endocannabinoid system, “the same or similar benefits of cannabinoids found in humans can also be applied to most veterinary species.” In fact, people have been giving medical cannabis to pets and farm animals since the 1800s. [28]
Con 1: CBD pet products are unregulated.
The lack of regulation means pet owners could be buying CBD with unlisted ingredients that are potentially toxic to their pets, such as THC. Experts say these products are in need of testing for the presence of heavy metals, pesticides, and THC. “It’s really the Wild West out there,” says S. David Moche, CEO of a veterinary medicine company that sells CBD products. [14] [15] [16]
Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that 70% of the CBD products they analyzed didn’t match the concentration listed on the label, and 21% of their samples contained THC, despite it not being on the label. [17]
“We want to stress that FDA has not approved cannabis for any use in animals, and the agency cannot ensure the safety or effectiveness of these products,” warns the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to the FDA, animals who ingest cannabis could suffer negative side effects such as “lethargy, depression, heavy drooling, vomiting, agitation, tremors, and convulsions.” [18]
Con 2: There isn’t enough scientific evidence to support giving CBD to pets.
Research in this area is so new that no one knows the long-term impacts of CBD use in companion animals or what an effective and safe dose would be. [23]
“We just don’t have enough information at this point to draw any legitimate conclusions.…there is no assurance the CBD oil they purchase is safe or effective,” argues Sue Lowum, a veterinarian and associate professor at the University of Minnesota who says she wouldn’t recommend CBD for pets. Veterinarians’ knowledge about CBD use in pets is purely anecdotal at the moment because of the limited scientific evidence available. [16] [24]
Further, researchers found that some seller’s websites contain “blatant lies” about CBD. [16]
The American Veterinary Medical Association states, “While both marijuana and industrial hemp products are available, no studies, doses, or uses in veterinary medicine have been determined.…AVMA cautions pet owners against the use of such products.” [25]
Con 3: Using CBD instead of traditional medicine may harm animals.
A phenomenon called the “caregiver placebo effect” may cause pet owners to misread their animals’ response to CBD. This might lead to suffering in animals that could have been helped by veterinarian-prescribed medications with scientifically proven effectiveness. [29]
“Because we are so invested in our pet, we really want to see them improve and likely believe the treatment will work.…There is a real risk we will see improvement even when it is not there,” says Alex Avery, veterinary surgeon and founder of Our Pets Health. [30]
Much of what we know about therapeutic CBD is specific to humans, and its effects on companion animals could be quite different because they don’t metabolize it the same way. CBD could also cause dangerous interactions with pharmaceutical drugs prescribed by a vet. [28] [31] [32]

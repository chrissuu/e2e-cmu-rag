Rihanna (born February 20, 1988, St. Michael parish, Barbados) is a Barbadian pop and rhythm-and-blues (R&B) singer who became a worldwide star in the early 21st century. She is known for her distinctive and versatile voice and for her fashionable appearance. She is also known for her beauty and fashion lines.
Early life
Fenty grew up in Barbados with a Barbadian father and a Guyanese mother. As a child, she listened to Caribbean music , such as reggae , as well as American hip-hop and R&B. She especially enjoyed singing and won a high-school talent show with a rendition of a Mariah Carey song. About the same time, she started a girl group with two friends, and in 2004 she attracted the attention of Evan Rogers, an American record producer. He helped Fenty record a demo that led to an audition with the rapper Jay-Z , who at the time headed the Def Jam record label, and he soon signed the budding vocalist. For her professional career, she adopted her middle name, Rihanna.
Music career: A Girl Like Me and Good Girl Gone Bad
With the effervescent dancehall -inflected single “Pon de Replay” (2005), Rihanna immediately captured an international audience. The song’s success buoyed sales for her debut full-length recording, Music of the Sun (2005), on which conventional R&B ballads shared space with Caribbean-flavored dance-pop that showcased her melodious Barbadian lilt. Rihanna soon followed with the album A Girl Like Me (2006), featuring the up-tempo club-oriented “S.O.S.” The song, which was built around a sample of Soft Cell ’s 1981 new-wave hit “Tainted Love,” became Rihanna’s first to top the Billboard singles chart.

For Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna sought to transform her youthful image. With the assistance of such high-profile collaborators as Timbaland and Justin Timberlake , she abandoned the tropical rhythms that had adorned her first two albums and recorded a collection of sleek R&B that presented her as a fiercely independent and rebellious woman. (She also unveiled a spiky asymmetrical hairstyle.) The gambit paid off, as the album sold several million copies worldwide, and its anthemic lead single, “ Umbrella,” featuring an introductory rap from Jay-Z, became one of the year’s biggest hits and earned Rihanna a Grammy Award .
Later works: Rated R , Talk That Talk , and Unapologetic
In early 2009 Rihanna was beaten by her boyfriend, fellow R&B star Chris Brown , in an incident that was widely covered by tabloid news and gossip blogs. Following their separation, he was convicted of assault. The album that followed later that year, Rated R , much of which she cowrote, was marked by icily stark production and brooding lyrics that touched on revenge. Although her sales declined somewhat, she scored another major hit with “Rude Boy.” Rihanna returned to less-portentous fare on the dance-friendly Loud (2010). In early 2011 the album’s sexually provocative single “S&M” became her 10th number one Billboard hit—which made her, at age 23, the youngest artist ever to reach that milestone. Included in the total were prominent collaborations with hip-hop artists T.I. and Eminem that appeared on albums of theirs; many felt her vocals on the latter’s “Love the Way You Lie” (2010) lent resonance to the song’s depiction of an abusive relationship.
Rihanna maintained a steely and seductive persona on the albums Talk That Talk (2011), which produced the infectious international hit “We Found Love,” and Unapologetic (2012), which was anchored by the starry-eyed “Diamonds.” The latter release also controversially featured a duet with Brown, with whom she rekindled her relationship for a brief time. Her eighth studio album, Anti , was released in 2016. Rihanna began working on a new record, but the project was delayed as she took a break from music. However, she later cowrote and performed “Lift Me Up” for the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). For her work on the single, Rihanna received her first Academy Award nomination, for best original song. In 2023 she returned to the stage for the first time in some four years, performing at the Super Bowl halftime show.
Other activities: acting and Fenty Beauty
In addition to her musical career, Rihanna acted in the movies Battleship (2012) and This Is the End (2013). She also voiced one of the main characters in the animated adventure Home (2015). Rihanna later appeared as a hacker in Ocean’s 8 (2018), a female-driven reboot of the Ocean’s Eleven franchise from the early 2000s. In 2019 she starred with Donald Glover in the musical Guava Island ; it premiered at the Coachella Valley Festival before streaming on Amazon .
After collaborating on several cosmetics collections in the early 2010s, Rihanna launched her own line, Fenty Beauty, in 2017. The brand was enthusiastically embraced by fans and was praised for its inclusivity in offering 40 different shades of foundation. She later launched (2018) Savage X Fenty, a clothing line of lingerie and loungewear. In 2019 it was announced that Rihanna was partnering with LVMH Moët Hennessy—Louis Vuitton to create the fashion line Fenty. She thereby became the first woman of color to head a fashion house at LVMH, which was the largest luxury-products company in the world. Fenty’s first collection was released later that year. However, the line struggled, and in 2021 it was announced that Fenty was being paused “pending better conditions.”
Personal life
Rihanna’s personal life attracted intense media attention. Her tumultuous relationship with Brown, especially the 2009 domestic violence incident, was fodder for the tabloids. She later dated Canadian rapper Drake . In 2021 it was confirmed that Rihanna was in a relationship with rapper A$AP Rocky. The couple welcomed a baby boy the following year. In 2023 Rihanna revealed she was again pregnant by performing at the Super Bowl halftime show with a visible baby bump; her representatives subsequently confirmed that the singer was expecting her second child. In August that year Rihanna gave birth to her second son.

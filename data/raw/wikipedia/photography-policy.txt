Commercial & Business Photography Policy
We require photographers and videographers shooting for commercial or business use to obtain a permit in advance. Permits start at $150 with set-ups including one camera person using hand-held equipment only. Use of static equipment, such as tripods, requires an additional fee for staff time.
Requests for permits must be submitted at least 10 business days in advance and are subject to staff availability. Permits are non-refundable. In the case of inclement weather, permits can be rescheduled depending upon availability.
Please email media@thefrickpittsburgh.org with your desired date and time, crew size, and camera set up to request a permit.

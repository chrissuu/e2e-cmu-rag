In a transformative milestone for access and affordability in higher education, Carnegie Mellon University has announced the launch of the CMU Pathway Program (opens in new window) , set to begin in the 2025-26 academic year. This initiative aims to provide significant financial relief to undergraduates from low- and middle-income families, ensuring that a quality education at CMU is within reach for all deserving students.
Under the CMU Pathway Program, students from families earning less than $75,000 annually will be able to attend CMU tuition-free. Additionally, those from families earning less than $100,000 annually will have the opportunity to pursue their studies without the burden of federal student loans. This program is designed to support new and returning undergraduate students on CMU’s Pittsburgh campus who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and whose families have typical assets for their income.
The CMU Pathway Program is only part of the university's broader commitment to enhancing access and affordability for students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Over the past decade, the university has increased its investment in undergraduate financial aid by more than 86%, rising from $76 million in fiscal year 2015 to $141 million in fiscal year 2024. Furthermore, CMU has met and will continue to meet 100% of demonstrated financial need for all undergraduate students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents, regardless of their family income.
The university has also made strides in reducing student debt. The percentage of CMU students borrowing federal loans has decreased from 52% in 2019 to 28% in 2024, with the average debt burden at graduation dropping nearly 30%, from $25,936 to $18,200.
“Our aspiration for Carnegie Mellon University is simple. We want every student who has earned a spot at CMU to be able to join us and thrive regardless of their family's financial resources or socioeconomic status,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. "The CMU Pathway Program represents our greatest investment so far in realizing this powerful vision."
In addition to the CMU Pathway Program, CMU has previously launched the Tartan Scholars program (opens in new window) for undergraduates and the CMU Rales Fellows Program (opens in new window) for graduate STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) students. These programs provide financial aid alongside mentoring, networking and academic support and are specifically aimed at high-achieving students from historically underrepresented groups.
Provost and Chief Academic Officer James H. Garrett Jr. and Chief Financial Officer Angela Blanton have been instrumental in realizing these milestones, reflecting CMU's commitment to fostering an inclusive educational environment.

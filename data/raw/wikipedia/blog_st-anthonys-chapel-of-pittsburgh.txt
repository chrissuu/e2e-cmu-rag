Since that time, more than five thousand impressively displayed Catholic relics have lined the sanctuary walls from life-sized depictions of the Stations of the Cross, to a first class relic of Saint Anthony and even a thorn from Jesus' Crown of Thorns. Dogma aside, these grand historic artifacts represent an important collection of humanity spanning centuries, continents and personal beliefs.
"Here Lie the Saints in Peace."
This quote, inscribed in Latin above the church's central arch, sums up the experience of visiting Saint Anthony's. There are far too many genuinely priceless artifacts to mention here, so it's well worth making the journey to experience the artifacts in your own way. With informative tours in the welcoming chapel available every day except Friday, Saint Anthony's is a must visit for any fan of religious architecture and the marvels of Catholic history.
Chapel Visiting Hours Open daily (except Friday) 1-4 PM Closed on holidays. Group tours are available and should be arranged in advance by calling the Chapel office 412-323-9504.

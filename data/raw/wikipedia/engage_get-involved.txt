Volunteer Opportunities
Carnegie Mellon volunteers are alumni, parents, faculty, staff and friends who believe in the university’s mission and advocate for it on campus and around the world. As a CMU volunteer, you’ll be able to share your Tartan pride, enjoy new experiences, connect with old friends — and make new ones.

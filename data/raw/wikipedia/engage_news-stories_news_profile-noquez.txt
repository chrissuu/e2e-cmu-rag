She was drawn to cards because they are an everyday object that people are familiar with.
“Most people have a deck of cards in their house, have played card games, have handled cards,” Tori says. “I'm very attracted to how ordinary that is and that something magical is happening with them.”
As she’s delved into card magic over the years, she noticed that two staples of the craft have some mathematical underpinnings.
“It turns out they both have a lot of mathematical properties that aren't super well understood or super well represented in the magic literature currently.”
She’s compiled her findings, from both a mathematician’s and a performer’s perspective, into a series of what she’s calling lecture notes that she hopes to publish. She’s given lectures on the topic at several magic clubs, explaining how certain properties can be exploited in the development of a card trick.
Tori’s ability to take these sorts of building blocks and create new tricks impressed the world-famous team of Penn & Teller, who called her trick “very original” with “a beautiful reveal.”
And although Tori didn’t fool them — they figured out how she pulled off the trick — it was still a dream come true for her to perform for her magic heroes on a Vegas mainstage.
When her research and teaching schedule allows, Tori performs at magic clubs across the country, including venues in L.A., Boston and Chicago. She doesn’t have a background in acting or performing, so on stage, she’s just her authentic self — but that comes with a certain mystique, she says.
“There's this stereotype that math is mysterious and that you must have some supernatural ability to be good at math. It kind of plays naturally to the audience that I've got some skill set that to them is somehow magical.”

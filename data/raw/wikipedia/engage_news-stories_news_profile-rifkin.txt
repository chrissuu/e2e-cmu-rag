“From a personal financial standpoint, the benefit of it all is you can get an immediate tax deduction when you put money into the fund, even though it may not yet have gone to the end charitable beneficiary,” he says.
Bob’s annual donations have continued, but his DAF with the Jewish Community Foundation of Dallas gives him the ability to make more significant contributions in the future. First, he named his DAF as an estate beneficiary of his personal retirement accounts. Second, he provided instructions to the foundation to eventually distribute those funds to his favorite charities, including Carnegie Mellon.
“I can still make my objectives work by setting it up so that the DAF can be a beneficiary of my 401(k), and then I just tell the donor-advised fund, ‘OK. When the DAF receives the money, I want you to give X to so and so,’” he says. “So basically, Carnegie Mellon and some other charities will get my money from my estate when I pass away.”
Bob says setting up his donor-advised fund was an easy thing to do, in more ways than one. The mechanics of setting up the fund were straight-forward, and will also simplify the future distribution of his retirement funds and other assets as directed by his current estate plans.
And giving to the schools and organizations that impacted his life is the easiest thing of all.
“I asked myself, ‘Where do I kind of feel an obligation to pay back?’” he says. “And certainly, the universities I went to would be very, very high on that list.”

A Doctor’s Perspective
Dr. Darby is an award-winning double board-certified obesity and family physician with more than 20 years of experience in the medical field. She’s also the owner of Lifestyle Changes , a virtual medical practice that offers weight management and corporate wellness programs.
Being a coroner was not on her bucket list, but after some thought, she realized she could bring a lot of value to the role.
“As I was campaigning, everybody asked me, ‘Why do you want to be the coroner?’” Dr. Darby says. “I was like, ‘I didn't.’ I didn't want to be because as a doctor, I heal and keep people alive. That's what I do. We talk about preventative medicine, being proactive and keeping you healthy and well.
“When I thought about it more, I said to myself, ‘I can utilize this platform in a different way to talk about preventable death causes such as heart disease, substance abuse and suicide prevention.’”
She won the election and took office in January 2024.
“It's been a whirlwind of a year. I just came in and started getting things done because they really didn't have a hands-on coroner here, like a leader for this office, for almost a decade,” she says. “So it was getting in here, reviewing and enhancing policies and procedures. Also, looking over the wages of our staff members and making sure they were fair and equitable. I was able to upgrade some positions, and also increase some wages in the office. And I did that in record time.”
Dr. Darby also focused on increasing education and awareness during her first year. Her office hosted seminars for nurses, first and last responders, law enforcement and forensics students, as well as open houses and multiple events for the community.
“We were explaining to the community what we do, why we do what we do, and how we go through death investigations to ultimately provide closure to the decedent’s family members,” she says.

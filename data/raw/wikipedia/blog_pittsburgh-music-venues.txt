This venue also will bring in national touring acts and holiday concerts, too.
The Benedum Center has been restored to its 1928 glory and is one of the poshest venues on this list. While home to the Pittsburgh Opera, this 2,800-seat venue also sees a variety of music acts perform here throughout the year. The Byham is smaller at 1,300 seats, and where you can see productions from the Bridge Theater Series , Pittsburgh Dance Council and Pittsburgh Musical Theater, but keep an eye on their events calendar for specialty concerts too, like a special Herbie Hancock performance in 2024.
And don't count out Greer Cabaret Theater , newly renovated and with ability to have inspired food and drink options brought to your table as you enjoy the show. There's free live music here weekly including jazz, quintets, drums and more.

Our Vision : Great Music in Every Life
Our Mission : To engage, enrich, and inspire  through unparalleled live musical experiences
Our Values : Excellence – Inclusivity –  Integrity – Celebration/Enjoyment
Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity,  Accessibility and Inclusion*:
We respect the  diversity of our community and human rights of all. We value diverse  perspectives and contributions in the creation of the work and presentation of  music we share with our community. We strive to  create a culture of dignity, respect and belonging for all individuals whom we  employ, interact with and/or engage, regardless of background or experience. We recognize that our  organization does not equitably represent our community, specifically in regard  to people who identify as Black, indigenous and people of color, and we are  determined to change this. We commit to creating  a welcoming, accessible, and inclusive environment for all constituencies  engaged with the PSO and in Heinz Hall, and will do this with the participation  of the entire Board of Directors, staff, musicians, volunteers, and community  members.
Who We Serve : We serve the city of Pittsburgh, the residents of Allegheny  County as well as residents from a thirteen-county region across Western  Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.  In addition, we serve an  international audience through our touring, recording activities and legacy.

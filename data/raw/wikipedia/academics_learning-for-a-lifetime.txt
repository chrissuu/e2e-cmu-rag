Adults Aged 50+
Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI), formerly the Academy for Lifelong Learning, welcomes adults in the Pittsburgh area to learn more about the program.
Endowed by the Bernard Osher Foundation, OLLI at CMU is a non-credit program supported by Carnegie Mellon University since its charter in 1992.
Members participate in courses selected by the curriculum committee with suggestions from the membership.
Dedicated volunteers lead courses and manage the program. Most classes are held during daylight hours.

Pittsburgh Panthers women's basketball is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate women's basketball program of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as "Pitt", located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pitt women's basketball team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference and plays their home games in the Petersen Events Center. The university first sponsored women's basketball on the varsity level in 1914 and have appeared in five straight national post-season tournaments between 2006 and 2010.

Women's intercollegiate varsity basketball at the University of Pittsburgh began during the 1914–1915 [3] season and found early success until 1926–1927 after which it was disbanded in favor of intramural sports programs.  Varsity basketball for women was reinstated during the 1970–1971 season.  Although participants were awarded varsity letters and competed intercollegiately, the program wasn't taken over by the Athletic Department until the 1974–1975 season. During the 1970s, the team earned several EAIAW regional tournament appearances. Pitt began competing in the Big East Conference in 1982, and the Panthers won the Big East regular season championship in 1984. Pitt appeared in the National Women's Invitational Tournament in 1981 and 1994 as well as the Women's National Invitation Tournament in 2000 and 2006 before earning its first ever NCAA tournament appearance in 2007, where they advanced to the second round before losing to eventual national champion Tennessee. The Panthers then advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in 2008 and 2009,[4] and made their fifth straight post-season tournament appearance in the WNIT in 2010. On April 12, 2013, Pitt hired Suzie McConnell-Serio to replace Berenato as head coach.[5] Pitt moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) beginning with the 2013–14 season.

Pitt's varsity women's basketball program, the only women's varsity sport at the school during that time, was started in the 1914–15 season and continued until 1926–1927 when it was dropped in favor of a  program of intramural women's athletics that could provide more opportunities for the female students at the university. The varsity women's basketball program was revived for the 1970–71 season and moved under the auspices of the athletic department in 1974–75. Records prior to the 1974–75 are largely incomplete (see notes).[7][8]

Middletown Township is a township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 15,807 at the 2010 census.[3] The Pennsylvania State University has an undergraduate satellite campus called Penn State Brandywine located in the north-central portion of the township. Located outside of Philadelphia, it constitutes part of the Delaware Valley (i.e. the Philadelphia metro area).

Originally established in 1686, Middletown Township adopted a Home Rule Charter in 1978. The township is governed by the council-manager system, a representative form of government in which the seven elected officials set policy for the township and the manager oversees the delivery of all public services and programs.

Middletown Township was probably established as a township in 1686, but it is first mentioned in 1687 when John Martin was established as constable. The name of the township is believed to be derived from its position in the middle or center of Chester County[4] where it resided until 1789, when Delaware County was created from the eastern portion of Chester County.[5] Delaware County played an important role in the anti-slavery movement. Not only did residents advocate for manumission, noted local families such as the Van Leers bought and sold lots to free black tradesmen or only to people who were supportive of the free black community. The location is now known as Van Leer Avenue. The local community grew with support from local neighbors.[6][7]

The John J. Tyler Arboretum and Ridley Creek State Park are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

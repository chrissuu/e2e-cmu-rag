Hellbender Vinyl is a vinyl record manufacturing company located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Opened in 2023, it is notable as the only record pressing plant currently operating in Western Pennsylvania.[1][2]

Hellbender Vinyl was founded by Misra Records manager Jeff Betten and Paperhaus band member Matt Dowling. Betten cited the vinyl revival of the 2010s as the reason that the two men felt Hellbender Vinyl would be a necessary addition to the music industry.[3]

The company is located in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh.[4] To date, Hellbender Vinyl has pressed records for clients such as DFTBA Records, MCG Jazz, Guster, Wheatus, Dizzy Reed, Raymond Watts, Zao, Sparta, Caroline Rose, and more.[5][6]

In May 2025, Hellbender Vinyl made news when it was announced that the company had pressed a 7-inch record for The Ataris containing the ashes of singer Kristopher Roe's father, William.[7][8][9]

Hellbender Vinyl participated in the Super Bowl LIX ad campaign by Mountain Dew Baja Blast, in which it pressed 7-inch records of the song "Kiss from a Lime" by Seal featured in the commercial.[6][10]

Hellbender Vinyl uses the WarmTone vinyl press engineered by Canada's Viryl Technologies.[11] Before the introduction of the WarmTone, all current record pressing facilities used machines exclusively resurfaced from the 20th century. The resurfaced machines press an average of two records per minute. The WarmTone press averages three records per minute with a smaller percentage for error.[12]

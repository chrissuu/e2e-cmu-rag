Ridley Township derives its name from Ridley, Cheshire, England, from where John Simcock, one of the original settlers, emigrated.[4] The first mention of Ridley in court records is from 1684 when tax collectors were appointed for the township.[5]

During the Revolutionary War, Ridley was traversed by both the Continental Army and the British Army. George Washington moved his troops through Ridley Township on his way to Wilmington, Delaware to oppose General Howe. After the Battle of Brandywine, Continental Army soldiers camped along the road in Ridley and George Washington spent the night in the home of John McIlvain. On November 19, 1777, General Cornwallis marched 3,000 men from Philadelphia through Ridley township. It was reported that the "men robbed the inoffensive people on the route without mercy, taking food from the indigent widow as remorselessly from the wealthy husbandman." On December 22, 1777, General Howe and troops passed through Ridley on their raid to and beyond Darby.[6]

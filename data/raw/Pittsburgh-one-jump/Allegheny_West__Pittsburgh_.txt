Allegheny West is a historic neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's North Side. The Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission voted in favor of designating the neighborhood as a city historic district in September 1989.[4]

The neighborhood has two zip codes of both 15233 and 15212, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 1 (North Side).[5][6][pageÂ needed]

The area was frequented by Native Americans until late in the 18th century. In 1787 David Redick began a survey of the area, with land to be given to Continental soldiers as part of their pay for service in the American Revolution. In 1788 lots in the area were auctioned off in Philadelphia. Houses were first built in the district in 1846-47 and streets were laid out about the same time. In the 1860s there was another boom in housing construction.[1]

In the late 19th century Ridge Avenue became known as "Millionaire's Row" with mansions built for Henry W. Oliver, William Penn Snyder, Harmar Denny, Alexander M. Byers, and others. Lincoln Avenue also became known for its mansions.[1]

The neighborhood is the birthplace of Gertrude Stein.

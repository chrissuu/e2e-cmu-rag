Millcraft Industries, Inc. is a real estate and development company based in the Pittsburgh suburb of Cecil Township, Pennsylvania.

Millcraft began as a steel production company before expanding into real estate.[3]  In 2005, following a deal with Hilton Hotels and an expanding commercial real estate business, Millcraft formally exited the steel industry.[1]

The company has a strong presence in Western Pennsylvania.[1]

In 2012, the Wall Street Journal praised Millcraft's River Vue apartment building as being part of a renewed push for livability in Downtown Pittsburgh.[4]

In 2008, Millcraft CFO Brian Walker, won the Pittsburgh Business Times CFO of the Year award in the "Large private company" category.[5]  The award was largely the result of Walker's ability to use the New Markets Tax Credit Program to finance previously impossible projects in Downtown Pittsburgh.[5]

In March 2009, Millcraft purchased the Pittsburgh State Office Building.[6]  The sale was criticized by Pennsylvania State Auditor General Jack Wagner, who noted that the $4.6 million sale price was half its appraised value.[6]  He said that the plan would cost the taxpayers nearly $55 million in leases to move state workers to other buildings.[6]

The company owns and developed the Southpointe complex and "The Crossroads Project," a $100 Million renovation of the streets of Downtown Washington, Pennsylvania.[2]

The company is developing a $700 million mixed-use project called the Esplanade. [7] The project is to be located on the Ohio River in the North Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with development plans including a Ferris Wheel, man-made lake and four towers that will include a hotel, condominiums and apartments.

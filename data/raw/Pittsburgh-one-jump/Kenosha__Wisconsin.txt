Kenosha (/kəˈnoʊʃə/ ⓘ[10][11][12]) is a city in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, United States, and its county seat.[13] Situated on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, it is the fourth-most populous city in Wisconsin with a population of 99,986 at the 2020 census,[14] while the Kenosha metropolitan statistical area consisting solely of Kenosha County has roughly 169,000 residents.[15] Kenosha is a satellite city located roughly 32 miles (51 km) south of Milwaukee and 50 miles (80 km) north of Chicago via Interstate 94 and has significant cultural and economic connections to both cities.

Kenosha was founded in 1835 and incorporated in 1850. Initially developed as a port and manufacturing center, it played a prominent role in the regional economy through the 20th century, particularly in the automotive and durable goods industries. While manufacturing remains a component of the local economy, recent decades have seen growth in healthcare, education, and logistics. The headquarters of Snap-on and Jockey International are in Kenosha.[16] The city is home to several higher education institutions, including the University of Wisconsin–Parkside and Carthage College. Cultural and recreational amenities include the Kenosha Public Museum, Civil War Museum, and access to waterfront parks, marinas, and a restored electric streetcar system that serves the downtown and lakefront areas.

The Potawatomi originally named the area Kenozia (also transcribed ginoozhe, kinoje) "place of the pike",[17] while the Menominee referred to the place as Kenūsīw, meaning "Northern Pike".[18] The early Ojibwa name is reported as Masu-kinoja "trout (pike) come all at once".  These refer to the annual spawning of trout, in which thousands of fish entered the rivers from Lake Michigan, providing food for the coming months.

Sites of early human habitation have been discovered in the Kenosha vicinity. It remains unclear if any sites pre-date the Clovis culture[citation needed] but, if so, those sites would be contemporaneous with the Wisconsin glaciation.[19] Paleo-Indians settled in the area at least 13,500 years ago.[20]

The first European settlers, part of the Western Emigration Company, arrived in the early 1830s, from Hannibal and Troy, New York, led by John Bullen Jr., who sought to purchase enough land for a town. Thwarted in Milwaukee and Racine, the group arrived at Pike Creek on June 6, 1835, building log houses and later homes of frame, native stone, and brick. The first school and churches followed, with platting completed in 1836.[21] As more settlers arrived and the first post office was established, the village was known as Pike Creek, then renamed Southport in 1837, a name which lives on as a southeast-side neighborhood, park, and elementary school, and has been adopted by several businesses.[22]

The area became an important Great Lakes shipping port. In 1850, the village changed its name from Southport to Kenosha, which is its current name. The name Kenosha was adapted from the Chippewa word kinoje (pike or pickerel).[23]

From the beginning of the 20th century through the 1930s, Italian, Irish, Polish, and German immigrants, many of them skilled craftsmen, made their way to the city and contributed to the city's construction, culture, architecture, music, and literature.[24]

Kenosha was home to large automotive factories which fueled its economy during the 20th century.[25] Between 1902 and 1988, Kenosha produced millions of automobiles and trucks[26] including makes and models such as Jeffery, Rambler, Nash, Hudson, LaFayette, and American Motors Corporation (AMC). In May 1954, Nash acquired Detroit-based Hudson and the new firm was named American Motors Corporation. A 47-acre (190,000 m2) westside park and an elementary school are named for Charles W. Nash.[27] A prototype steam car was built in Kenosha by the Sullivan-Becker engineering firm in 1900. Two years later, the Thomas B. Jeffery Company, builders of the Sterling bicycle, began production of the Rambler runabout. In 1902, Rambler and Oldsmobile were the first cars to employ mass-production techniques. The 1903 Rambler was also the first US-built production automobile to use a steering wheel, rather than the then-common tiller-controlled steering. Auto executive Charles W. Nash purchased Jeffery in 1916 and the new company became Nash Motors.

In partnership with French automaker Renault, AMC manufactured several models in Kenosha in the early 1980s, including the Alliance, which won the 1983 "Car of The Year" award from Motor Trend. Two decades earlier, AMC's 1963 Rambler Classic had also received the award. In 1987, Renault sold its controlling interest in AMC to Chrysler Corporation, which had already contracted with AMC for the production of its M-body midsized cars at the Kenosha plant. The AMC Lakefront plant (1960–1988), a smaller facility, was demolished in 1990 (a chimney-demolition ceremony that June drew 10,000 spectators) and was redeveloped into HarborPark.[28] The area now hosts lakeside condominiums, a large recreational marina, numerous parks and promenades, sculptures, fountains, the Kenosha Public Museum, and the Civil War Museum, all of which are connected by the Kenosha Electric Railway streetcar system.

Like other Rust Belt cities, Kenosha deindustrialized in the 1980s, causing it to gradually transition into a services-based economy.[29] In the 2010s, the city and surrounding county have benefited from an expanding economy and increased job growth.[30][31]

In 1973, residents in the Town of Pleasant Prairie sought to have territory annexed and rezoned to allow for the industrial development of agricultural property.[32] In the ensuing legal battle between Kenosha and Pleasant Prairie, the town accused the city of improperly coercing or bribing agricultural property owners to file for rezoning and annexation in order to obtain city water and electric services that could not be provided by the town. The town argued that industrial development would jeopardize the town's residential nature. The court found the annexation proper, with no illicit bribes or improper conduct by the city.

In June 1993, the city installed reproductions of the historic Sheridan LeGrande street lights that were specially designed for Kenosha by Westinghouse Electric in 1928; these can be seen on Sixth Avenue between 54th Street and 59th Place. 

The two-mile (3.2 km) downtown electric streetcar system was opened on June 17, 2000, and on September 22, 2014, the Kenosha city council approved a crosstown extension of the system incorporating the existing route between 48th and 61st Streets on both 6th and 8th Avenues.[33]

In the aftermath of the August 2020 police shooting of Jacob Blake, protests, riots, and civil unrest occurred in Kenosha. Demonstrations were marked by daily peaceful protesting followed by confrontations with law enforcement and rioting, looting, vandalism, and arson at night. A state of emergency was declared on August 23, and the National Guard was activated the following day. On August 25, a controversial shooting occurred during the unrest, leading to a polarized response.[34] Both then-President Donald Trump and then-Presidential candidate Joe Biden visited Kenosha.[35]

Protests continued daily through August 29 with approximately 2,000 members of the National Guard assisting the city in restoring order.[36][37][38][39] Damages exceeding $50 million occurred, with over 100 businesses affected.[39]

In November 2021, Kenosha once again became the subject of worldwide attention as the jury trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the defendant in the 2020 unrest shooting, commenced.[40] As part of the city's emergency preparedness, over 500 members of the National Guard were activated ahead of the verdict.[41] Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed Rittenhouse's unlawful possession charge and the curfew violation charge for being legally unsupported,[42][43] and a unanimous jury found Rittenhouse not guilty of the remaining charges.[44] Following the verdict on November 19, some protests occurred in Kenosha but remained peaceful.[45]

On December 7, 2021, "Carl the Kenosha Turkey", a turkey who had become a social media sensation and local icon, was hit by a vehicle and killed.[46] The turkey was named the city's unofficial mascot in 2020 and was seen by some as a source of positivity as Kenosha faced hardships in 2020–2021.[47]

Kenosha has 21 locations and four districts (Library Park Historic District, Third Avenue Historic District, Civic Center Historic District, and Pearl Street Historic District) listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[48] The city has a Kenosha Landmarks Commission, and among the many local city-designated landmarks are the 1929 YMCA, the Manor House, the John McCaffary House, the St. Matthew Episcopal Church, the Washington Park Clubhouse, the Ritacca Triplex, the Ritacca Service Station, and the Justin Weed House.

Kenosha is in southeastern Wisconsin, bordered by Lake Michigan to the east, the village of Somers to the north, the village of Bristol to the west, and the village of Pleasant Prairie to the south. Kenosha's passenger train station is the last stop on Chicago's Union Pacific North Metra Line. Kenosha is 32 miles south of Milwaukee and 49 miles north of Chicago.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 27.03 square miles (70.01 km2), of which 26.93 square miles (69.75 km2) is land and 0.10 square miles (0.26 km2) is water.[49]

Kenosha is home to a mixture of blue and white collar workers as well as students who attend the local universities. Kenosha consists of neighborhoods divided into three regions – Downtown, Uptown, and West of I-94 (referred to by locals at "West of the I" or simply "the county").[50] The city's northside is home to both the University of Wisconsin–Parkside and Carthage College.

Kenosha's downtown is located along the Lake Michigan shoreline and consists of government buildings, parks, beaches, restaurants, shops, museums, and entertainment venues. The neighborhood of HarborPark is both a residential and commercial area.[51] Directly south of the Downtown area is the neighborhood of Allendale.[52]

Uptown Kenosha consists of a largely blue-collar population and is a mixture of locally owned businesses and residential areas.[53] Prominent Uptown neighborhoods include Brass,[54] Lincoln Park,[55] and Wilson Heights.[56]

The 2010 census reported that 51 percent of Kenosha residents moved in from other cities and states. The Chamber of Commerce attributed this to the city's museums, lakeshore attractions, cultural and work opportunities, its public-school system, transportation amenities, and relatively lower costs-of-living.[71]

The importance of manufacturing jobs in Kenosha continues to diminish with only 11.7 percent or 7,769 of the total workforce of 66,362 area residents involved, a decline of 22 percent since 1990 and much lower than the statewide percentage of 16.4 percent.[72]

The biggest surge in Kenosha employment by percentage has been in the white-collar workforce. From 1990 to 2017, the percentage of Kenosha's workforce in business and professional services grew nearly fivefold from 3.2% of the workforce to 11%, while statewide the trend was slightly more than double. The growth has been both to due new office developments in the city, but also due to new suburban developments as Illinois workers seek more affordable housing.[72]

As of the census[8] of 2000, there were 90,352 people, 34,411 households, and 22,539 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,795.1 inhabitants per square mile (1,465.3/km2).

Kenosha's economy is fueled by its position within the Chicago-Milwaukee corridor. Nearly half of Kenosha's workforce commutes outside of Kenosha County to their employers.[78] The Chicago-area commuter rail network Metra has a route between Downtown Chicago and Kenosha. A 2016 study found that Kenosha's "out-commuters most likely work for positions in healthcare, manufacturing, professional/scientific and technical services. The majority of occupations included management, business/financial, and office/administrative support position", and 73 percent of out-commuters have a bachelor's degree or a higher level of education.[79] Due to lower housing costs compared to other parts of the Chicago metropolitan area, Kenosha is a popular relocation area those wanting to benefit from high paying jobs and a lower cost of living.[80]

Snap-on Tools world headquarters and Jockey International corporate headquarters are in Kenosha. Kenosha has a number of light industrial and distribution companies in outlying business parks. Amazon, Rustoleum, Uline, Associated Wholesale Grocers, and others have warehouses and distribution centers located in Kenosha.[81][82][83][84][85] In 2022, Square Roots farm opened a fully indoor hydroponic facility within refurbished shipping containers in Kenosha.

Downtown Kenosha sits along the Lake Michigan lakefront. In recent years, organizations such as Downtown Kenosha Inc. (DKI) manage the day-to-day economic development efforts, business support and promotional activities for the district.[88] In 2023, a $450 million development to the downtown area was approved by the city council. The development plan will include thousands of apartments, condominiums, office buildings, retail spaces, hotels, and government buildings all within a nine-block radius.[89]

Downtown Kenosha is home to the Kenosha HarborMarket, a European-style farmer's market held mid-May through mid-October on 2nd Ave bisected by the 56th Street boulevard streetcar line. It hosts stalls with local food products and artisan creations.[90] In addition, the downtown area has a collection of over 50 restaurants, bars, breweries, and shops of various kinds. Frank's Diner, which has been an attraction in downtown Kenosha since 1926, is the oldest diner in the United States and has been featured twice on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, once in 2007 and again in 2021.[91][92] Residential developments have also provided added condominiums and apartments.[93]

It will serve as a multi-purpose building dedicated to education, workforce development, and entrepreneurial opportunities.[94] In December 2020, the city announced a plan for the KIN.[95] In July 2021, the federal government awarded Kenosha $4.9 million in federal CARES Act funds toward the neighborhood,[96] and in November, Mayor John Antaramian announced that Lakeview Technology Academy would relocate to the KIN.[97] In March 2022, Evers officially announced $15 million in funding toward the KIN, which is expected to take 8–10 years to be fully completed and will include the collaboration of UW-Parkside, Carthage College, Gateway Technical College, and Herzing University.[98]

Kenosha's four downtown museums, the Kenosha Public Museum, the Civil War Museum and the Dinosaur Discovery Museum, and the Kenosha Historical Center are Smithsonian Institution affiliates.[99]

Completed in 2001, the Kenosha Public Museum is on the Lake Michigan shoreline. Its main exhibit is a prehistoric woolly mammoth skeleton uncovered in western Kenosha in 1992. Cut-marks on its bones indicate that the animals were butchered by humans using stone tools. Carbon dating indicates their age to be 12,500 radiocarbon years old or 14,500 calendar years old, one thousand radiocarbon years earlier than the previously accepted presence of humans in the Americas. The museum also displays other ice age and fine art exhibits.[100] A second permanent exhibit on local ecosystems and the history of museums and science opened in 2019.[101][102]

However, due to the huge influx of commuters to Chicago, Charter Spectrum's Kenosha system carries both Chicago and Milwaukee. Arbitron classifies Kenosha as part of the Chicago radio market. Five major radio stations broadcast from Kenosha: WLIP (CBS Radio) 1050 AM, Gateway Technical College's WGTD (91.1 FM), a member station of the Wisconsin Public Radio News & Classical Music Network, rock WIIL (95.1 FM) and classic hits WWDV (96.9 FM), which simulcasts Chicago-based WDRV (97.1 FM). The Kenosha Convention and Visitors Bureau operates WPUR937 (1180 AM), a low-power tourist information station.[161]

WPXE (channel 55), the Ion Television owned-and-operated station for the Milwaukee market, is Kenosha's only locally-licensed television station, though in reality it only mentions Kenosha in its legal IDs. Its transmitter is located with the Milwaukee PBS tower on Milwaukee's north side, and its studios are based in suburban Glendale, thus it serves the entire Milwaukee television market. Kenosha is served by several Chicago-based television and radio stations.

Since June 2000, a 2-mile (3.2 km) streetcar line has served the downtown area and HarborPark, connecting the Metra station with downtown and several area parks. Kenosha is one of the smallest cities in America with any type of streetcar system today.[164]

In addition to its streetcar line, Kenosha has a city bus network with eight routes. Kenosha was the first city to color-code transit routes (with the Blue, Green, Red, and Orange Lines), and also the first city to use electric trolley buses in full transit service, both occurring on February 14, 1932.[165]

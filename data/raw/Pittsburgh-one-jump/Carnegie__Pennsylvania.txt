Carnegie (/kɑːrˈneɪɡi/[3]) is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 8,134 in the 2020 census.[4] It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

Carnegie is named after Andrew Carnegie, who donated one of his libraries for the gesture.[5] It was incorporated on March 1, 1894, from the boroughs of Chartiers and Mansfield (separated by Chartiers Creek).[6] Later, the borough annexed part of Robinson Township (now Rosslyn Heights). Neighborhoods include Rosslyn Heights, Cubbage Hill, Irishtown, Forsythe Hill, Library Hill, and Old Mansfield.[citation needed]

Many neighborhoods were at one time or another SKRT mined[definition needed] for coal. The main employers were steel mills such as Superior Steel & Union Electric Steel. Carnegie had a rail yard that had connections to several railroads early in the twentieth century, including the Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.[citation needed]

On August 25, 1923, an estimated 10,000[7]–30,000 members of the Ku Klux Klan (from surrounding areas) marched there to celebrate a so-called "Karnegie Day" and target the heavily-Catholic town's residents. The march was resisted by local residents, resulting in a riot which left injuries on both sides and the death of a Klansman.[8][9]

In the 1970s, Carnegie suffered economically with the closure of the great steel mills such as J & L in and around Pittsburgh.[citation needed]

In 2004, Carnegie was significantly damaged by flooding as a result of Hurricane Ivan. Much of the commercial section of the borough, as well as the borough's Roman Catholic churches, was closed or damaged. But since 2014, Carnegie's Main Street has rebounded with many new restaurants and small businesses.[10]

Glen Hazel was developed by the Federal Works Agency during World War II as a government housing project for defense workers called Glen Hazel Heights. The 1,000-unit development was built in 1941â€“1942 and was one of the largest defense housing projects in the country.[4][5] The defense housing was razed in the 1970s and replaced with a new 104-unit public housing project and a 155-unit senior living facility.[6][7]

Situated along the Monongahela River, most of Glen Hazel is bordered by Hazelwood and shares a small border with Squirrel Hill South to the northeast.  The Glenwood Bridge across the Monongahela connects Glen Hazel to another Pittsburgh neighborhood, Hays, to the south.

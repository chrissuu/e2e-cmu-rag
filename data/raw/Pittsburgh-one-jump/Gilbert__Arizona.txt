Gilbert is a town in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. Located southeast of Phoenix, Gilbert is home to 288,128 residents.[6] It is the fifth-most populous municipality in Arizona and is considered a suburb of Phoenix.[7]

Incorporated on July 6, 1920, Gilbert was once known as the "Hay Shipping Capital of the World".[8]

Gilbert was established by William "Bobby" Gilbert, who provided land to the Arizona Eastern Railway in 1902 to construct a rail line between Phoenix and Florence, Arizona. Ayer's Grocery Store, Gilbert's first store, opened in 1910 and became the location of the first post office in 1912. The post office moved several times before settling on the east side of Gilbert Road in downtown, where it stands today. In 1912, many Mormons who had fled the Mormon colonies in Mexico due to the actions of Pancho Villa's forces settled in Gilbert. By 1915, they began holding church meetings at the Gilbert Elementary School. In 1918, they were organized into the Gilbert Ward.[9]

Incorporated on July 6, 1920, Gilbert was primarily a farming community fueled by the rail line and construction of the Roosevelt Dam and the Eastern and Consolidated Canals. It remained an agricultural town for many years and was known as the "Hay Capital of the World"[10] from 1911 until the late 1920s.

Gilbert is in the southeastern Phoenix metropolitan area. It is south of Mesa, northeast of Chandler, and northwest of Queen Creek.[11]

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of 68.86 square miles (178.35 km2), of which 68.65 square miles (177.80 km2) is land and 0.20 square miles (0.52 km2) is water.[1]

Gilbert has a subtropical, hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with dry and hot summers, and mild to warm winters, with little rainfall.

As of the 2020 census, there were 267,918 people, 88,896 households, and 69,603 families residing in the town.[15] There were 93,230 housing units.

The town's official tourism site, Discover Gilbert,[26] highlights attractions for new and returning visitors. Sightseeing opportunities include the mural-clad brick walls, the color-changing water tower, waterways art, a solo gopher, and glowing benches. Gilbert also features an established theater, historical museum, and gallery.

Gilbert Town Hall is home to a 9/11 Memorial[27] that features an eight-foot steel girder beam[28] that held up the North Tower of the World Trade Center.[citation needed] Former Gilbert Fire Chief Collin DeWitt raised money for three years to create the memorial and bring the beam from New York City to Arizona. He drove to collect it himself along with then Assistant Fire Chief Jim Jobusch.[29]

The memorial's design angles the beam, putting it in reach of everyone. Four granite walls bear the names of those killed in the attacks. Concrete was poured in the shape of a pentagon for the memorial's foundation,[30] and is surrounded by bricks that bear the names of some of those who donated to the memorial's creation. The memorial was unveiled in a ceremony on the attacks' 10th anniversary, on September 11, 2011.[31]

Gilbert Elementary School was built in 1913, and now houses the Gilbert Historical Museum. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.[32]

The Gilbert Parks and Recreation department provides parks, recreation, and cultural programs for residents and visitors. Gilbert has over 600 acres of open space, 37 park ramadas, four public pools, a riparian area, and over 40 sports fields. Gilbert Parks and Recreation is accredited by the Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies. It is also recognized as a Certified Autism Center by the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (IBCCES).[33]

Since Gilbert remains incorporated as a town, it lacks the additional powers possessed by nearby Mesa and Chandler, which are incorporated as cities. For instance, Arizona towns do not have as much power to regulate utilities and construction within their borders as cities do.[34] Unlike most of its neighboring communities, Gilbert is theoretically vulnerable to annexation.[35]

The town is part of Arizona's 5th congressional district, which is represented by Republican and Gilbert resident Andy Biggs.[36] The mayor is Brigette Peterson.[37]

Most of Gilbert is zoned to schools in the Gilbert Public Schools, while other parts are zoned to districts including the Chandler Unified School District, Mesa Public Schools, and the Higley Unified School District. Also in Gilbert are charter schools such as Eduprize (the first charter school in Arizona), American Leadership Academy, and Legacy Traditional School. The town is also home to Gilbert Christian Schools, a chain of private schools. In 2018, Park University opened the Gilbert Campus Center after leasing 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) at the University Building in the city's Heritage District.[41]

Gilbert is primarily served by one area freeway—the Santan Freeway portion of Loop 202. A small section of the US 60 Superstition Freeway also skirts Gilbert's northern boundary at the Higley Road interchange (Exit 186). Several regional arterials also serve the area, including Williams Field Road, Chandler Boulevard, and Gilbert Road. The town is relatively close to Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airport, in east Mesa, and is a 25-minute drive from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

A park-and-ride facility is in downtown Gilbert for bus service. Although the facility borders the Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) tracks and has provisions for commuter rail service, there is currently no such service. Bus service is limited in Gilbert, with some north–south routes in Mesa dead-ending at Baseline Road before entering Gilbert. Routes that serve portions of Gilbert include the 108-Elliot Road, 112-Country Club/Arizona Avenue, 136-Gilbert Road, 140-Ray Road, 156-Chandler Boulevard/Williams Field Road, 184-Power Road, and 531-Mesa/Gilbert Express, with most of these routes operating at 30-minute frequency on weekdays. Sunday service is only available on Routes 108, 112, 156, and 184. Most people get around by car or bike. Gilbert has a low proportion of households without cars. In 2015, 1.9% of Gilbert households lacked a car, and the figure was 1.7% in 2016. The national average in 2016 was 8.7%. Gilbert averaged 2.08 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.[42]

In 2018 Waymo started testing in a small portion of Gilbert's northwest.[43]

There are 56 municipalities classified as cities in the U.S. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.[1] 
Each city is further classified based on population, with Philadelphia being of the first class, Pittsburgh of the second class, Scranton of the second class A, and the remaining 53 cities being of the third class.

While the default form of government for third class cities is the Third Class City Code, only 18 cities still use this form of government. The City of Parker is the only city that still operates under a special act, and has a weak mayor-council form of government. All three cities not of the third class, along with 23 third class cities, have adopted home rule charters, which give the cities broader powers to manage their affairs. When a city adopts a home rule charter, it does not lose its status as a city nor its classification.[2]

Two cities have adopted optional plans under the same law. From 1957 to 1972, third class cities were able to adopt optional charters. Nine remain in effect. Cities that operate under home rule charters, optional plans, or optional charters are also found in the List of Pennsylvania municipalities and counties with home rule charters, optional charters, or optional plans.

Home rule municipalities that are styled as cities but not classified as cities are not included below.

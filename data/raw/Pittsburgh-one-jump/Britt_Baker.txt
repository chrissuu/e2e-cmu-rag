Brittany Ann Baker[3] was born in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania on April 23, 1991 to elementary school teacher Mary Ann and healthcare executive Sam Baker. She has a younger brother named Dane. She had an athletic childhood, participating in basketball and track and field.[4][5][6] She studied behavioral medicine with a minor in human development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University, graduating in 2013.[4][7] In 2014, the same year she began training as a professional wrestler, she enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine[8] and graduated in May 2018.[9]

Baker began training as a professional wrestler in June 2014 when she enrolled at the International Wrestling Cartel (IWC) training academy in South Hills, Pennsylvania,[7] training under the tutelage of Super Hentai and Marshall Gambino.[10] She also trained under Johnny Gargano and Candice LeRae at Absolute Intense Wrestling in Cleveland, Ohio.[10] She made her debut at an IWC event in August 2015.[10] She appeared on WWE Raw as a jobber in 2016, losing to Nia Jax in a squash match.[11] On December 10, 2016, she became the inaugural IWC Women's Champion when she defeated April Sera, Marti Belle, and Sonya Strong in a four-way elimination match.[12] She was defeated by LuFisto for the title in July 2017.[13] On September 1, 2018, Baker competed in a four corner survival match against Madison Rayne, Chelsea Green, and Tessa Blanchard at the All In pay-per-view event, which was won by Blanchard.[14] She regained the IWC Women's Championship by defeating LuFisto and Ray Lyn in a three-way match in October, only to drop it again in November to Katie Arquette.[15], Baker would also make appearances in Ring of Honor, between 2016 to 2019.

On January 2, 2019, it was reported that Baker would sign with newfound promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW),[16] officially signing the following January 8 as the company's first contracted female wrestler.[17] She made her debut for AEW on May 25 at its inaugural pay-per-view, Double or Nothing, where she defeated Nyla Rose, Kylie Rae, and Awesome Kong in a four-way match.[18][19] On July 13, she competed in a tag team match alongside Riho at Fight for the Fallen, where the two were defeated by Bea Priestley and Shoko Nakajima.[20] Baker suffered a legitimate concussion due to a kick by Priestley during the match,[21] which incited a storyline rivalry between the two.[22] On August 31, Baker competed in the Women's Casino Battle Royale for an opportunity at the AEW Women's World Championship at the All Out pre-show, during which she eliminated Shazza McKenzie, ODB, Brandi Rhodes, Mercedes Martinez, and Priestley before she herself was eliminated by Nyla Rose.[23] Baker went on to defeat Priestley in a singles competition at the Full Gear pre-show on November 9.[24]

At Chris Jericho's Rock 'N' Wrestling Rager at Sea Part Deux: Second Wave, which aired on Dynamite on January 22, 2020, Baker turned heel after she berated commentator Tony Schiavone following her victory over Priscilla Kelly.[25] In May, Baker injured her leg during a tag team match, in which she and Rose went on to defeat Hikaru Shida and Kris Statlander, later stating that she would return in a wrestling role in September at All Out.[26] Baker then began a rivalry with Big Swole, which involved Swole abducting her and tossing her into a dumpster during an episode of Dynamite.[27][28] In July, she underwent surgery on her nose to repair a deviated septum.[29] At All Out, Baker lost to Big Swole in a Tooth and Nail match, which was taped at her dental office.[30] In November 2020, Baker began a feud with Thunder Rosa.[31] The two competed against each other at Beach Break in February 2021, where Baker was victorious.[32] That same month, she participated in the AEW Women's World Championship Eliminator Tournament as part of the U.S. bracket, defeating Madi Wrenkowski in the first round but losing to Nyla Rose in the semifinals.[33][34] The feud concluded on the March 17 episode of Dynamite in the program's first main event to feature women, during which Rosa defeated Baker in an unsanctioned Lights Out match.[35] The match received praise from critics.[36][37][38]

At Double or Nothing on May 30, Baker defeated Shida to win the AEW Women's World Championship for the first time.[39] On the premiere episode of Rampage on August 13, Baker held on to the title by defeating Red Velvet, after which she introduced Jamie Hayter as her ally.[40] Baker successfully defended her title for the fifth time when she defeated Tay Conti at Full Gear.[41] At Revolution in March 2022, Baker debuted a new AEW Women's World Championship belt and retained the title over Rosa.[42] On Dynamite later that month, Baker lost the AEW Women's World Championship to Rosa in a steel cage match.[43]

Following an unsuccessful challenge for the TBS Championship on the September 16 episode of Collision, Baker took a step back from performing due to a back injury, later stating "I listen [...] A lot of [the fans] said, 'We want less Britt Baker.' So, if that's what they want, that's what they'll get. Let me take a step back, here are the rest of the women."[49]

On June 30, 2024 at Forbidden Door, Baker made her return after over nine months from hiatus by interrupting the TBS and newly crowned Strong Women's Champion Mercedes Moné.[50] On the following episode of Dynamite, Baker stated that she had initially been sidelined by two herniated disks and a torn hip labrum, before suffering a transient ischemic attack in November that further sidelined her for the first half of 2024. She would then be interrupted by Moné, who Baker would then challenge to a match on August 25 at All In but was rejected.[51] On July 24 at Blood & Guts, Baker defeated Hikaru Shida in her first match since October 2023. After the match, she would be interrupted once again by Moné and attacked by a debuting Kamille.[52] Following a brawl during AEW's panel at Comic-Con the next day, AEW president Tony Khan announced that Baker would challenge Moné for the TBS Championship at All In.[53] On August 2, it was reported that Baker had been suspended after a backstage altercation with MJF and his girlfriend Alicia Atout.[54] On August 25 at All In, Baker was defeated by Moné.[55] On the November 13 episode of Dynamite, Baker defeated Penelope Ford. After the match, Baker was confronted by Serena Deeb in which Baker responded by saying "nobody cares" repeatedly towards Deeb and the camera.[56] As of August 2025, this is Baker's latest AEW appearance.[57][58]

Baker's legitimate profession as a dentist is often referenced as part of her character in AEW, so much so that Pro Wrestling Torch observed that "it became a parody".[59] The character was originally described as "happy",[60] but following her heel turn, has been described as "too proud" and "delusional",[61][62] referring to herself as a "role model".[63] Using the name "Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D." in AEW, Baker says she intentionally incorporated "Dr." and "D.M.D." despite the tautology of employing both to enhance "her character's obnoxiousness".[64][65] Her finisher is a scissored armbar mandible claw called Lockjaw.[66] She associates with commentator Tony Schiavone, whom she calls one of her best friends, and fellow wrestler Rebel, who accompanies her in matches.[2][67] She named Bayley and Mercedes Moné as among her inspirations in wrestling.[68]

Baker appears as a main cast member for AEW All Access.[69] She made her video game debut as a playable character in AEW Fight Forever.[70]

Baker, alongside Adam Cole, appeared on the May 8, 2022 episode "Working to Death" of the American reality series Bar Rescue.[71] She also had a guest role in the sixth season of Cobra Kai.[72]

Baker was in a relationship with fellow AEW wrestler Adam Cole from 2017 to 2024.[2] In October 2024, Cole confirmed in an interview with Sports Illustrated that he and Baker were no longer together, but remain friends.[73]

In addition to wrestling, Baker is a member of the American Dental Association[9] and is employed as a dentist at a private practice in Winter Park, Florida,[74] with whom she has an agreement for it to remain closed on Wednesdays to allow her to travel for AEW Dynamite.[75] She said in 2018 that dentistry was her "forever dream job" and that she intended to continue practicing it during and after her wrestling career.[76]

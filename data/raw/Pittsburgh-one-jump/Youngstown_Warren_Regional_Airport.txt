Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (IATA: YNG, ICAO: KYNG, FAA LID: YNG) is a public and military airport in Vienna Township, Trumbull County, Ohio, 11 miles north of Youngstown[1] and 10 miles (16 km) east of Warren. The airport is home to the Youngstown–Warren Air Reserve Station.

The airport has been in operation for over 50 years. It is run by the Western Reserve Port Authority, made up of members appointed by the Mahoning and Trumbull County Commissioners. While there hasn't been commercial service to the airport since 2018, private jets and small charter flights continue to serve the area as of December 2023.

The airport is part of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). In 2024, it was designated as a primary airport, allocating it an extra $1 million per year over 5 years for maintenance.[2][3]

The Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport began as the Youngstown Municipal Airport (MAP), and was one of the last Works Progress Administration projects. Construction began in 1939, and the airport opened a year later. The airport is located 11 miles (18 km) north of Youngstown in Vienna Center due to limited space available within the city for the planned size. The airport that had been serving the city, Lansdowne Airport, lacked room to expand.

In 1981, a 225,000-ft2 production facility for the Commuter Aircraft Corporation was built on the west side of the airport, but the company closed down before any aircraft were built.[4][5][6]

Northwest Airlines discontinued service to Detroit via Akron-Canton in September 2002, leaving the airport without scheduled airline service.[7][8] In May 2006, Allegiant Air launched a route to Orlando/Sanford.[9][10] It subsequently added flights to St. Petersburg/Clearwater and Myrtle Beach. The company ceased all of its Youngstown routes in January 2018, and the airport has lacked passenger air service.[11] In July 2016 with Aerodynamics Inc. began service to Chicago–O'Hare but that service only lasted until mid-August, less than two months after it started.[12]

In June 2023, local city leaders filed an application with the Department of Transportation requesting a grant valued at $1.4 million (including existing aid from other sources), in order assist in returning commercial service to the airport within the next two years.[13]

Youngstown ARS is located at the Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport. Its primary mission is to serve as home of the 910th Airlift Wing (910 AW), an Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)  C-130J Hercules unit with two flying squadrons and a total of 16 aircraft. The 910 AW is operationally gained by the Air Mobility Command  and a portion of the wing is devoted to its aerial spray mission. The 910 AW has nearly 1,450 personnel, consisting of a combination of full-time active guard and reserve, air reserve technicians, and traditional part-time drilling Air Force reservists. The installation also hosts a Navy Operational Support Center and a Marine Corps Reserve Center that is home to nearly 400 Navy and Marine Corps reservists in various units.  It is also home to the Youngstown ARS Composite Squadron of the Ohio Wing of the Civil Air Patrol.[14]

Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport covers 1,468 acres (594 ha) at an elevation of 1,196 feet (365 m) above mean sea level. It has three asphalt runways: 5/23 is 5,002 by 150 feet (1,525 x 46 m); 14/32 is 9,003 by 150 feet (2,744 x 46 m); 143/323, a military-use only runway/landing zone, is 3,501 by 60 feet (1,067 x 18 m).[1]

The airport has a fixed base operator that sells both avgas and Jet A. Services such as catering, hangars, courtesy cars, and [rental cars are available; amenities such as internet, conference rooms, vending machines, a crew lounge, and televisions are available.[15]

In the year ending September 30, 2019, the airport had 20,029 aircraft operations, average 69 per day: 66% general aviation, 23% military, 10% air taxi and  less than 1% scheduled commercial. 37 aircraft were then based at this airport: 20 single-engine, 2 multi-engine, 7 jet and 8 military.[1]

The former long-term parking lot is currently being used as a training location for a tractor-trailer driving school.

The Youngstown Warren Regional Airport terminal building sits on the southeast end of the airport.

In 2000, the Youngstown Airport renovated and expanded the boarding area. The new gate area consists of six gates (two jetways and four ground-loading gates), and can accommodate aircraft ranging up to the size of a Boeing 757. The airport is equipped to handle up to 250,000 passengers a year in the current configuration and can seat up to 400 passengers at any given time.

The airport currently has four ticket counters, one baggage claim and on-site capacity for up to five rental car companies. The airport's only on-site restaurant, Mikees II, closed shortly after Allegiant Air ceased all remaining operations to the airport in 2018. The airport offers a recently expanded parking facility with the lowest cost of parking in the area.

The airport's master plan calls for an expanded terminal to add another three gates, should air service return and spike at any time.

Youngstown Airport has a number of taxicab and shuttle services.

Avis Car Rental and Budget Rent a Car offer rental vehicles from the airport.

Wood Street Galleries is an Art Gallery located in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, operated by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. The Gallery has built a reputation for exhibiting International New Media Artists due to the years long curation of former Director and Curator, Murray Horne.[1][2][3][4][5] The gallery occupies the upper floors of the Wood Street 'T Station' building.[6][7][8]

The trapezoidal building that houses the gallery has been rented to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust since 1990 by the Pittsburgh Port Authority for $1 per year.[9] Wood Street Galleries was established two years later in 1992, with former Director and Curator Murray Horne joining the gallery later in the 1990's.[9]

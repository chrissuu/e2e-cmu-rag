Upper St. Clair is a township with home rule status in southern Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, located approximately 8 miles (13 km) south of Downtown Pittsburgh. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 21,160. It is known for being an affluent suburb of Pittsburgh.

Around 9% of the township's area is dedicated to 14 parks and multiple fields, totaling approximately 733 acres.[2] The township has six borders with neighboring communities, including South Fayette Township to the west, Bridgeville to the northwest, Scott Township and Mt. Lebanon to the north, Bethel Park to the east, and Peters Township in Washington County to the south.

St. Clair Township was named after General Arthur St. Clair of Revolutionary War fame, the ninth President of the United States in Congress Assembled. Under his administration as president from February 2, 1787, to October 29, 1787, the Northwest Ordinance and United States Constitution of 1787 were passed.[3]

The first European settler in present-day Upper St. Clair was John Fife, who settled near what is now the intersection of Washington and McLaughlin Run roads in 1762.[4]

St. Clair was one of the original townships of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania at the county's creation in 1788. In 1836, the St. Clair Township was divided into two separate townships, Upper St. Clair and Lower St. Clair. The residents of Upper St. Clair formed their township to ensure better government service that could be obtained by separating from the more densely populated northern part of the township. Upper St. Clair Township was further subdivided throughout the 19th and 20th centuries as several parts of the original township separated to form new townships and boroughs. In 1973, Upper St. Clair Township adopted a home rule charter that took effect on January 5, 1976, and is no longer governed by the Pennsylvania Township Code.[5]

The Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 had its roots in Upper St. Clair.

Formed as a volunteer militia company in 1844 by residents of the township, the "St. Clair Guards" later became Company H of the 62nd Pennsylvania Infantry.

The community was home to several mines beginning in the late 19th century. Freehold Real Estate Co. built the first major residential development in March 1913 along Washington Road, which at the time was conveniently close to streetcar service. During the 1930s, Upper St. Clair was recorded as a community within the city which had a school district providing regular nursing services.[6]

Today, the community has many fashionable homes and is considered one of the wealthiest suburbs of Pittsburgh.[7] The township has also gained fame as being a filming location for the movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower.[8][9][10]

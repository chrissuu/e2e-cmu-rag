Frisco is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located in Collin and Denton counties. It is part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex (DFW) and about 25 miles (40 km) from both Dallas Love Field and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Its population was 200,509 in the 2020 U.S. census.[4][7]

Frisco was the fastest-growing city in the United States in 2017,[8] and also from 2000 to 2009. In the late 1990s, the northern DFW suburban development tide hit the northern border of Plano and spilled into Frisco, sparking rapid growth into the 2000s. Like many of the cities in Dallas's northern exurbs, Frisco serves as a bedroom community for professionals who work in DFW. Since 2003, Frisco has received the designation Tree City USA from the National Arbor Day Foundation.

The United States Census Bureau defines an urban area of northern Dallas-area suburbs that are separated from the Dallas–Fort Worth urban area, with McKinney and Frisco as the principal cities: the McKinney–Frisco, Texas, urban area had a population of 504,803 as of the 2020 census, ranked 83rd in the United States.[2]

When the Dallas area was being settled by American pioneers, many of the settlers traveled by wagon trains along the Shawnee Trail. This trail became the Preston Trail, and later Preston Road. With all this activity, the community of Lebanon was founded along this trail and was granted a U.S. post office in 1860.[9]

In 1902, a line of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway ("the Frisco") was being built through the area, and periodic watering stops were needed along the route for the steam locomotives. The current settlement of Lebanon was on Preston Ridge and was too high in elevation, so the watering stop was placed about 4 miles (6 km) to the west on lower ground. A community grew around this train stop, and some Lebanon residents moved their houses to the new community on logs.[10] The new town was originally named Emerson, but the U.S. Postal Service rejected the name as too similar to another community, Emberson, in Lamar County.[11]

In 1904, the town's residents chose "Frisco City" in honor of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. This name was later shortened to Frisco.[11]

Frisco is within the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, partially in Denton and Collin counties, in North Texas. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 62.4 sq mi (161.6 km2), of which 160.1 km2 (61.8 sq mi) is land and 0.58 sq mi (1.5 km2), or 0.92%, is covered by water.

Frisco is part of the humid subtropical region. The city gets 39 inches (990 mm) of precipitation per year. On average, 230 days per year are sunny. The July high is 96 °F (36 °C); the January low is 33 °F (1 °C). The comfort index, which is based on humidity during the hot months, is 25 out of 100, where higher is more comfortable.[12]
The city is also in Tornado Alley, with the most recent confirmed tornado in 2024, as an EF-0 tornado, near the UNT Frisco Campus.

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 200,509 people, 64,151 households, and 48,519 families residing in the city, up from 2010's tabulation of 116,989.

Among the population, the 2019 American Community Survey estimated 51.9% were white, 8.4% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 26.0% Asian alone, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 2.7% two or more races, and 10.7% Hispanic and Latino American.[31] By 2020, 48% of the population were white, 8.82% Black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 26.27% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 0.52% some other race, 4.55% multiracial, and 11.48% Hispanic or Latino.[32]

According to a 2010 American Community Survey estimate,[33] the median income for a household in the city was $100,868, the median income for a family was $109,086. The per capita income for the city was $38,048. About 2.2% of families and 5.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.5% of those under age 18 and 2.4% of those age 65 or over. The median price for a new home was $252,000. By 2019, its median income grew to $116,884.[34]

Retail establishments and restaurants line Preston Road, one of the city's major north–south traffic arteries.

Frisco took a different economic track than many surrounding cities, electing to use a fractional percent of local sales tax to fund the Frisco Economic Development Corporation (FEDC) rather than Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), the regional transportation body. The effectiveness of the FEDC, whose primary purpose is to reallocate such tax dollars to commercial ventures, is a matter of public debate.

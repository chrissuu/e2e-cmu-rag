The Independent Women's Football League (IWFL) was the first women's American football league established by women players for women players. The league was founded in 2000, began play in 2001, and played its last season in 2018.  Members of the original roster of the Austin Outlaws were the league's founders. Following the establishment of the league as a separate entity from the team, former Outlaws players Laurie Frederick, Jaime Bailey, and Sandra Plato became the original IWFL executive council.

The players were amateur/semi-professional and had to cover part of their expenses.[1]

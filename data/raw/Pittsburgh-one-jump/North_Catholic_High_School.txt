North Catholic High School is a private Catholic high school located in Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania. The school's mascot is the Trojan, and its colors are scarlet and gold.

North Catholic High School began as an all-boys school in 1939, founded by Bishop Hugh Charles Boyle of the Diocese of Pittsburgh and the Marianists.[7] Girls began enrolling in the school in 1973.  The original location of the high school was in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Troy Hill, where it remained in operation for 75 years.[8]

On June 2, 2012, the Diocese of Pittsburgh held a groundbreaking ceremony in Cranberry Township to signify the start of the construction of Cardinal Wuerl North Catholic High School, slated to receive students in the fall of 2014.  The school was renamed Cardinal Wuerl North Catholic High School for the 2013–2014 school year after Cardinal Donald Wuerl.[9]

On September 10, 2018, Dayton Daily News revealed that school officials shield some North Catholic faculty accused of sex abuse through transfers to Marian schools in Dayton, Ohio.[10]

In 2018, the name of the school reverted to North Catholic High School following criticism of Cardinal Wuerl by a grand jury investigation into child abuse in Pennsylvania.[11][12][13] There had been calls to remove the Cardinal's name since the grand jury report was released and the words "Cardinal Wuerl" on the sign outside of the school were spraypainted over by unknown vandals.[13][14] The name was removed at the request of the Cardinal.[12][13]

In 2015, students pushed for the creation of a FIRST Robotics team. The team was nicknamed the Trojanators, a spin-off of the school mascot, the Trojan. The team has won numerous awards, and several students have been named Dean's List Finalists. The team is a respected organization in the Western Pennsylvania Robotics scene.

In 2016, the North Catholic marching band was revitalized after ten years of its absence. The marching band performs halftime shows at both away and home football games and participates in parades.[16]

In 2021, North Catholic’s football team reached the 3A WPIAL Championship, ultimately losing to Central Valley.

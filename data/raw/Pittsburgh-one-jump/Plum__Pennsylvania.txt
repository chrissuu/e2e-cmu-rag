Plum is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 27,144 at the 2020 census.[3] A suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, it is located northeast of the city in what is commonly referred to as the East Hills suburbs.

Plum is often referred to as "Plum Boro" or more correctly "Plum Borough" by locals to distinguish it from its previous status as a township. It was founded as Plum Township in 1788 and was reorganized as a borough in 1956. The borough took its name from nearby Plum Creek.[4]

Plum Township was founded on December 18, 1788, as one of the original seven townships of Allegheny County. It originally extended as far south as Versailles (modern-day North Versailles Township), east to the county line, west to Pitt Township, and north to the Allegheny River. Plum has shrunk greatly over the years in area, but still remains among the larger municipalities in Allegheny County.[5]

The 1889 history of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, describes the township as having "no villages of importance", but listed the first postoffice, Antrim, 1840–1857; New Texas, a hamlet, in the geographic center of the township with "the usual mechanics, local stores, etc.", post office from 1856; and Logan's Ferry, on the Allegheny River and Allegheny Valley railroad, in the northeastern part of the township, deriving its name from early settler Alexander Logan and family, post office from 1844.[6]

Plum has a history of house explosions beginning in 1996, when one person was killed and one person injured; the explosion was caused by failure of gas pipes. Another explosion on March 5, 2008, which killed one and injured one, was also caused by failure of gas pipes.[7] On April 22, 2022, an explosion happened which injured five, and the cause has yet to be determined.[8][9] An explosion on August 12, 2023, killed six and injured two, and the cause is being investigated.[10][11]

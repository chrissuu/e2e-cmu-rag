The Allegheny County Police Department is a law enforcement agency in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The department provides law enforcement services on County property, including the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Allegheny County Airport, and various parks. Between 2017 and 2021, the ACPD was contracted by the borough of Wilmerding. It also provides assistance to all municipal law enforcement agencies in the County, and generally investigates all serious crimes, such as homicide, except in the City of Pittsburgh.

The Allegheny County Police Department was established in 1932 by an act of the Allegheny County Board of Commissioners and the Pennsylvania Legislature.

The executive of the Allegheny County Police Department is the Superintendent, who is appointed by the County Executive, and assisted by two Assistant Superintendents.[1] The current Superintendent is Christopher Kearns, since March 2021.[2][3] The department is in turn divided into two Divisions, each commanded by an Assistant Superintendent.


The Uniformed Division is primarily responsible for patrol of the Pittsburgh International Airport, Allegheny County Airport, nine county parks and several other county facilities and buildings.
The Detective Division is primarily responsible for investigation of crimes which occur on county property, and all serious crimes which occur within municipalities.

Between 2017 and 2021, the department provided law enforcement services to the borough of Wilmerding.[5][6][7]

Since the establishment of the department, three members have died in the line of duty.[8]

The Pittsburgh Keystones was the name of two historic professional Negro league baseball teams that operated in 1887 and again in 1921 and 1922. 

The first team was a member of the first black baseball league in 1887, the National Colored Base Ball League. The league was short-lived and the Keystones won four games but lost seven.[a] The team's roster included Weldy Walker, the second African-American to play in the major leagues and future hall of famer, Sol White.[1] The team folded during the season, along with the remaining teams in the league, on May 23, 1887.[2]: 408 

The second club was founded by Alexander McDonald Williams, a Barbadian immigrant and pool hall operator.[3]  The Keystones' home field was Central Park, located in the Hill District at the corner of Chauncey Street and Humber Way.[4] The park was built by the prominent African American architect Louis Arnett Stuart Bellinger, who would later design Greenlee Field for the Pittsburgh Crawfords.[5][6]

In their first season the Pittsburgh Keystones played as an independent club. They compiled a 9-20-2 record against Negro National League and other associate clubs.[7] The Keystones joined the Negro National League in 1922, finishing with a 14-29-3 record in league play under managers Dizzy Dismukes and Dicta Johnson.[7] The team disbanded after the season.

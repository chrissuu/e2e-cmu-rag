The Sporting News Executive of the Year Award was established in 1936 and is given annually to one executive, including general managers, in Major League Baseball (MLB). The presenting company is The Sporting News, formerly known as Sporting News from 2002 to 2022. Listed below in chronological order are the baseball executives chosen as recipients of the award.

The first recipient of the award was Branch Rickey, who went on to win the award a total of three times, twice with the St. Louis Cardinals and once with the Brooklyn Dodgers. George Weiss, who had a long and fruitful career as an executive with the New York Yankees, has the most wins, four, with three of them coming consecutively in 1950â€“1952. The most recent repeat winner of the award is Billy Beane, who won the award in 1999, 2012, and 2018, all with the Oakland Athletics. Executives with the Yankees of the American League have won the award eight times, more than any other team. In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals have the most wins, with seven. There has been one instance of the award being presented to an MLB executive rather than a team executive; Lee MacPhail in 1966.

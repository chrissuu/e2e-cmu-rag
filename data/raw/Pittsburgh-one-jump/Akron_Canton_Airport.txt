Akron–Canton Airport (IATA: CAK, ICAO: KCAK, FAA LID: CAK) is a commercial airport in the city of Green, in southern Summit County, Ohio (a small piece of each runway is in Stark County). The airport is located about 11 miles (18 km) southeast of Akron and 10 miles (16 km) northwest of Canton. It is jointly operated by Summit County and Stark County. The airport is a "reliever" airport for Northeast Ohio and markets itself as "A better way to go", emphasizing the ease of travel in comparison to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Just under 90% of its traffic is general aviation. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019–2023, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.[4]

Akron–Canton Airport covers 2,300 acres (9.3 km2) and has two runways: 01/19 is 7,601 feet long and 05/23 is 8,204 feet long.[3][5]

The airport has a maintenance base for PSA Airlines, a regional carrier owned by the American Airlines Group that flies under the American Eagle brand.

Public funds for the construction of the airport were allocated during World War II for defense purposes, but construction stalled over a controversy relating to whether public funding of airport construction would be appropriate. As a result, private funding was essential to the initial construction of the airport, particularly in purchasing the land.

The airport was dedicated on October 13, 1946, as the Akron–Canton–Massillon Airport; the name was later changed to Akron–Canton Regional Airport. Passenger air service began in 1948 when American, United, Capital, and Eastern airlines moved from the Akron Fulton International Airport.

A permanent terminal was built in 1955 and expanded in 1962. In the summer of 2020, a new expansion was made to the terminal, relocating gates from the original terminal to a new bi-level concourse. The original gates and terminal area from the 1960s are slated for demolition to make room for new aircraft parking areas.

In 2021, the airport received $7.7 million from the Federal Aviation Administration to acquire snow removal equipment, rehabilitate taxiways and aviation aprons, rehabilitate existing lighting systems, and perform sealing along sections of taxiway surface area.[6]

During the mid-2000s, the airport was one of the fastest-growing airports in the Midwest, attracting passengers from the Akron/Canton area and Cleveland metropolitan area.[7]  The airport's passenger count doubled between 2000 and 2006, with several new routes added by AirTran Airways and Frontier Airlines. The airport experienced its busiest year in 2012, with 1.83 million passengers flying through.

Since 2012, passenger traffic has decreased. AirTran's presence at the airport shrank following the airline's acquisition by Southwest Airlines in 2011. Several other low-cost carriers, including JetBlue, Frontier Airlines, and Spirit Airlines, established new routes from nearby Cleveland Hopkins, lowering average airfares at that airport and reducing demand for Cleveland-based travelers to fly out of further-away Akron.  In 2017, Southwest dropped Akron and consolidated operations at Cleveland Hopkins, as Allegiant Air did the same year.[8][9]

By 2017, the airport's passenger traffic sank to its lowest level since 2004. As of May 2018, the airport had the 2nd fastest declining passenger count of any US airport.[10]

In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport suffered further loss of service, as Delta Air Lines ceased its long-running service from the airport to Atlanta in 2020, and Spirit Airlines ended all flights to Orlando and seasonal service to Myrtle Beach and Fort Myers in 2022.[11][12] United Express dropped service to Washington–Dulles in 2022, citing ongoing staff shortages.[13] This service had replaced their erstwhile service to Newark in 2021, although the airline hopes to restart scheduled flights to Dulles in 2023.[14][13]

In 2006, the airport completed a terminal expansion and renovation, including the addition of a new wing off the main concourse. It increased the number of gates from 9 to 11 and provides new baggage areas, a food court, and better aesthetics. The new wing opened to passengers in May 2006 and was home to AirTran Airways and its successor, Southwest.

In 2011, the expanded TSA screening area was completed. It has four lanes for screening, with the ability to open two more. Along with the expanded screening area, Advanced Imaging Devices were installed and a TSA Precheck lane was added.

The airport initiated CAK 2018, its 10-year, $110 million Capital Improvement Plan, in March 2008. The plan is the most ambitious capital improvement plan in Akron–Canton Airport's history and calls for 10 projects in the next 10 years. One of those projects, a runway expansion, has already been completed: runway 05/23 was extended from 7,600 ft (2,300 m) to 8,200 ft (2,500 m). The runways will allow aircraft to fly non-stop to anywhere in the U.S. and throughout Mexico and Canada.

Other projects include expanding aircraft parking and general aviation area, replacing aircraft rescue and firefighting maintenance facility, a new customs and border patrol facility, expanding auto parking lots, a widened entrance road, expanded ticket wing and TSA screening area, and an expanded upper-level concourse. The construction of Port Green Industrial Park, on 213 acres (0.86 km2), also began to be developed into 10-12 business sites.

In June 2021, Breeze Airways launched nonstop flights from Akron to Charleston (SC), New Orleans, and Tampa.[15] They have since continued their expansion at the airport, adding scheduled service to Las Vegas, Nashville, and West Palm Beach.[16][17][18] Following the withdrawal of Spirit Airlines at CAK, Breeze Airways also announced the commencement of service to Orlando beginning in March 2023.[19]

In September 2021, Allegiant Air announced that they would be discontinuing service to Cleveland and returning to Akron–Canton, flying to 4 different destinations with operations beginning March 2, 2022.[20] Further expansions to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando-Sanford were announced in May 2022.[21]

In February 2025, Breeze Airways announced that Akron–Canton Airport will be opening a new crew base, set to start in summer 2025.[22]

The airport has two runways, both paved with asphalt. Runway 5/23 measures 8204 x 150 ft (2501 x 46 m), and runway 1/19 measures 7601 x 150 ft (2317 x 46 m). For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 58,035 aircraft operations, an average of 159 per day. This was 52% general aviation, 34% air taxi, 12% commercial, and 3% military. For the same time period, 129 aircraft were based at the airport: 59 single-engine and 25 multi-engine airplanes, 30 jets, 12 military aircraft, and 3 helicopters.

Akron–Canton Airport has a number of taxicab and shuttle services.[37]

It is also served by one route from each of the region's two public transit providers, Akron Metro Regional Transit route 110, and Canton-based Stark Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA) route 81.

The SARTA route provides service every hour for most of the day Monday through Saturday and serves both Canton and Akron via Interstate 77, including transit centers in both downtown Canton and downtown Akron.[38]

The Akron Metro route is a five-times-per-day Monday through Friday local route through Southern Summit County, but does serve the downtown Akron Transit Center.[39]

The paper for the first currency printed by the Continental Congress was made at the Ivy Mills founded by Thomas Willcox and Thomas Brown. The Ivy Mills was the second oldest paper mill in the United States.[6] The mill made printing paper for Benjamin Franklin and paper for currency for several Continental governments, the US government and many South American countries.[7] The oldest Roman Catholic parish in Pennsylvania began as a mission at the home of the Willcox family in 1730.[8] The church was later moved approximately one mile east to the top of the hill into what later became the Borough of Chester Heights and is known as St. Thomas the Apostle Church.

In 1702, the St. John's Episcopal Church was founded on land donated by John Hannum, a successful farmer and tavern owner who was baptized by the former Quaker George Keith. Keith was known to conduct services at the Hannum home on Concord Road.[9]

The Newlin Grist Mill has been grinding grain since 1704. It has an 11 feet (3.4 m) tall stone wheel housed in a timber frame. The mill and processing complex passed through various hands and, in the 1950s, it was purchased by a direct descendant of Nicholas Newlin, which along with 200 acres (81 ha) of surrounding countryside became the Newlin Mill Historic Park. The mill complex area was the location of the Markham post office and Markham train station (Philadelphia/Baltimore rail traffic).

The name "Concord" was believed to have been given by the earliest European settlers of the township and reflects the harmonious feelings among them at the time. Title to all real estate in the township can be traced back to a grant from William Penn.

Concord Township was a part of Chester County until 1789, at which point Delaware County was created by act of legislature. Farmers in the northern and western reaches of Chester County were weary of travelling a period of days to the county seat in Chester, on the Delaware River. The seat of Chester County was moved to Turk's Head, now West Chester, and was centrally located in the county.

The Brandywine Summit Camp Meeting, Concord Friends Meetinghouse, Concordville Historic District, Handwrought (also known as the Thomas Marshall House), High Hill Farm, Ivy Mills Historic District, Newlin Mill Complex, Nicholas Newlin House and Thompson Cottage are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[10]

U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 202 and U.S. Route 322 all intersect along the west edge of Concord Township. From that point, US 202 heads south along the Wilmington-West Chester Pike across the southwestern portion of the township, and heads north concurrent with US 322 along the northwestern border. US 1 and US 322 head eastward from their junction with US 202 along Baltimore Pike, with US 1 continuing northeastward across the northern portion of the township and US 322 breaking off to the southeast along Conchester Highway through the central and eastern portions of the township.

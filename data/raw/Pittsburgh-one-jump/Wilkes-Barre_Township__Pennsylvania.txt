Wilkes-Barre Township is a township with home rule status in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is adjacent to the city of Wilkes-Barre. The population of the township was 3,219 at the 2020 census.[2]

In 1753, the Susquehanna Company was formed in Connecticut for settling the Wyoming Valley in present-day Pennsylvania. Connecticut succeeded in purchasing the land from the Native Americans; however, Pennsylvania already claimed the valley through a purchase they made in 1736. In 1762, roughly two hundred Connecticut settlers (Yankees) established a settlement near Mill Creek. They planted wheat and constructed log cabins. They returned to New England for the winter.[4]

The Connecticut settlers returned in the spring of 1763 with their families. A party of Iroquois also visited the area with the dual purpose of inciting the Lenape and killing Teedyuscung, a local Delaware chief. On April 19, 1763, the residence of the chief and twenty others around it were set ablaze. Teedyuscung, under the influence of liquor, perished in the inferno. This was revenge for the death of an Iroquois warrior in 1758. The Iroquois allowed for the Delaware to believe that this atrocity was committed by the settlers. As a result, the Delaware attacked the colonists on October 15, 1763. Thirty settlers were killed, and several others were taken prisoner. Those who managed to escape fled back to New England. The Delaware then burned what was left of the Yankee settlement.[4]

In 1769, during the colonial era, the Connecticut settlers (Yankees) returned to Wyoming Valley. Five townships were established by Connecticut Colony. Each one was five square miles and divided amongst forty settlers. Wilkes-Barre Township, named in honor of John Wilkes and Isaac Barré, was one of the original townships. Pennsylvanians (Pennamites) also arrived in the valley that same year.[4]

The Connecticut settlers established Fort Durkee, which was named in honor of their leader (Colonel Durkee). This was immediately followed by a series of skirmishes between the Pennsylvanians and Connecticut settlers. The land changed hands several times between the two groups. Finally, after many years of fighting, the land was granted to Pennsylvania.[4]

James Sutton built the first gristmill in the township in 1782.[5] In 1806, a large portion of the territory broke away from the township to form the borough of Wilkes-Barre. Today, the township of Wilkes-Barre occupies a 1-by-3-mile (1.6 by 4.8 km) strip of land adjacent to the southeast border of what is now the city of Wilkes-Barre.

Coal mining was a prominent industry in and around Wilkes-Barre Township in the late 19th and early 20th century. The Laurel Run mine fire started near the village of Georgetown in 1915. The fire under Georgetown was controlled by blocking off the tunnels in the vicinity, robbing it of the necessary oxygen to continue burning.[6]

The township became a commercial destination in northeastern Pennsylvania, adding the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza and several major shopping hubs, including the Arena Hub Plaza, Wilkes-Barre Township Commons, Wilkes-Barre Township Marketplace, and Wyoming Valley Mall. Most of these shopping areas were developed in the early 2000s, although the Wyoming Valley Mall was constructed in the 1970s following the aftermath of Hurricane Agnes.

The township underwent several devastating tornadoes in the early 20th century (in 1914 and 1917). On Wednesday, June 13, 2018 (at about 10 pm), an EF2 tornado struck the business district of Wilkes-Barre Township.[7] Dozens of commercial buildings were severely damaged.[8] The National Weather Service stated "the tornado touched down near the La-Z-Boy furniture store at Mundy Street and Highland Park Boulevard and continued for three-quarters of a mile ending near I-81 behind Dick's Sporting Goods in the Arena Hub Plaza. It's estimated that the tornado was on the ground for about five minutes." Six people sustained minor injuries.[9]

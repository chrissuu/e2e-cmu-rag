Oakland Catholic High School is a private, Roman Catholic college preparatory school for girls, located in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, within the Diocese of Pittsburgh.   It was established by Bishop Donald Wuerl in 1989 as the merger of former all-girl parish high schools of Sacred Heart and St. Paul Cathedral to serve as a sister school for Central Catholic.  Approximately 600 students matriculate at Oakland Catholic and the school draws female students from all over Pittsburgh and its suburbs.  Upon graduation, 100% of its students continue to a four-year university.[citation needed]

Oakland Catholic High School completed construction and renovations for the 2008-2009 school year.

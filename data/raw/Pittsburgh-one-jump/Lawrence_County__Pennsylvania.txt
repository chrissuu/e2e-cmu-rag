Lawrence County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 86,070.[2] The county seat and largest city is New Castle.[3]

The county was created on March 20, 1849, from parts of Beaver and Mercer counties. The county is part of the Greater Pittsburgh region of the commonwealth.[a]

Lawrence County was created on March 20, 1849, from parts of Beaver and Mercer counties due to the rapid growth of New Castle, which was primarily in Mercer County but was rapidly expanding into Beaver County. The former borders between Beaver and Mercer Counties are still evident in Lawrence County today, as the northern borders of North Beaver Township, Shenango Township, and Slippery Rock Township with (respectively) the southern borders of Mahoning Township, Hickory Township, and Scott Township make up the former boundaries between Beaver and Mercer Counties. In addition, County Line Road in New Castle where the Lawrence County Courthouse is located also marks the former boundaries.

The county was named after the flagship of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the USS Lawrence, which was disabled in the September 10, 1813 Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812. The ship's complement included local raw recruits. That niagara-class brig (more correctly: snow) was itself a namesake, of Perry's friend and naval officer James Lawrence, who died during the War of 1812.[4]

In August 1981, county commissioner Paul L. Tanner proposed the creation of a flag for Lawrence County as well as a flag for each of the county's 27 municipalities These were to be displayed at the courthouse. Over the next few months, flags for Perry Township, New Beaver Borough, and Wampum Borough were presented to the commissioners[5]

On January 12, 1982, commissioner chairman, Frank A. Vitril, announced a county flag design contest and asked residents of Lawrence County to submit entries on an 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of paper with their name, address, and telephone number on an attached sheet of paper. The winner would receive $100 prize contributed in equal parts from the county commissioners and would not come from taxpayers. They also announced the formation of a committee, coordinated by the Lawrence County Planning Commission, to select the winner. The commissioners said in a statement, "As public officials, we are aware of the need to generate public spirit and interest in the affairs of local government. The promotion of a county flag will enable interested citizens (schools, art groups, etc.) of Lawrence County participation in an historic event."[6]

The winning flag was announced on June 4, 1982, and a ceremony was held at the courthouse on June 15, 1982, in observance of Flag Day, as the courthouse was closed on June 14. Rosemary Ann Marino, a commercial artist from New Castle, submitted several designs and her winning entry was one of 43 designs submitted by 15 individuals. The design depicts the shape of Lawrence County in green and edged with gold off-center on a white background with the words "Lawrence County, Pennsylvania" emblazoned on the bottom. The center logo features a shaft of wheat, symbolizing prosperity, against a background of rolling farmlands on the left and waves of water on the right. Marino received a check for $100 at a ceremony at the courthouse as well as a telegraph from Governor Dick Thornburgh who congratulated Lawrence County on its new flag.[7]

A painting of the design was revealed at the ceremony and was painted on masonite by Harry Broschart, who was on the flag selection committee. He and other committee members, Dominic Caminite and former director of arts and crafts at West Side Community Center, Virginia Rankin, gave the award presentations.[7] Honorable mentions included a covered bridge design by Grayce D. Sharek, a blue and gold circular design stating "Lawrence County, Government for the People, founded 1849" by Betty Stone, an outline of the courthouse against a red keystone on a blue background by Steve T. Grala, and a two-tone green flag with an outline of the county by James E. Hamilton.[5] Entries were judged based on originality, creativity, theme, clarity, and design.[6]

President Judge Glenn McCracken offered remarks urging those present to take pride in their home, Lawrence County, and the flag which symbolizes it, and saying Lawrence County needs the kind of American pride in their heredity that was reawakened by the television show Roots.[7]

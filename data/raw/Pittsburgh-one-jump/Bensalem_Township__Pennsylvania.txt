Bensalem Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township borders the northeastern section of Philadelphia and includes the communities of Andalusia, Bensalem, Bridgewater, Cornwells Heights, Eddington, Flushing, Oakford, Siles, Trappe, and Trevose.[3] Bensalem Township has no other incorporated municipalities within its boundaries. It is located within the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of 62,707, which made it the most populous municipality in Bucks County and the ninth-most populated municipality in Pennsylvania.

The township, which was founded in 1692, is almost as old as Pennsylvania itself, which was founded in 1682.

The origin of the name Bensalem likely comes from references made by settler Joseph Growden, who named his estate Manor of Bensalem in honor of William Penn and the Semitic term for peace, Salem.[4] It was originally named Salem; the first syllable Ben was added in 1701.[4] Another theory notes the shared name with the utopian island in Francis Bacon's New Atlantis, also named Bensalem.

The area of Bensalem Township appeared on the Holme Map of 1682, though not yet with a name. On January 2, 1685, the boundary was fixed between Bensalem and Philadelphia County along the Poquessing Creek. At the September 1692 session of Bucks County Court, a jury of thirteen men was formed to define boundaries of divisions that had been created up to that time. The report submitted in December states that "All the lands between Neshamineh and Poquessin, and so to the upper side of Joseph Growden's land in one and to be called 'Salem.'"

The first name of the township was Salem. The minutes of the Board of Property of the Province on November 19, 1701, at Philadelphia noted the name of the area as Bensalem. The population of the area was first a few Dutch and Swedes, then later a larger influx of English, and then additional Dutch settled the area.[3]

Bensalem is the southernmost township in Bucks County and is bordered by the Northeast Philadelphia section of the city of Philadelphia to the west and south, Croydon and the rest of Bristol Township to the east and northeast, the borough of Hulmeville and  Middletown Township to the north, and Feasterville, Trevose, and Oakford in Lower Southampton Township to the northwest.

The Erieâ€“Meadville, PA Combined Statistical Area (CSA) is made up of two counties in northwestern Pennsylvania. The United States Office of Management and Budget[2] has recognized the Erie and Meadville areas along with the counties of Erie and Crawford to make a Combined Statistical Area, located in northwestern Pennsylvania. Though these county line boundaries are rather arbitrary since Erie serves as the regional hub for the bordering areas of southwestern New York and northeastern Ohio, including the cities of Jamestown and Conneaut.[citation needed]

As of the 2010 United States census[3] the combined statistical area had a population total of 369,331, making it the seventh-largest in Pennsylvania and 102nd-largest in the nation.

Peters Township is a township in Washington County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 22,946 at the 2020 census.[2] It is a suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

Peters Township was incorporated in 1781 as one of Washington County's thirteen original townships. It had fallen within the area claimed by Virginia as its Yohogania County before the resolution of that state's boundary dispute with Pennsylvania. Over the years, portions of Peters Township were sectioned off to form other municipalities; eventually, leaving the present configuration of 19.5 square miles (51 km2).

Peters Township was named after William "Indian" Peters. There is uncertainty regarding Peters' race, with some sources holding that he was Native American and others that he was a white man who traded with local Native Americans. Regardless, the Indian name has long been associated with Peters Township.

Some of the first settlers were James and Joshua Wright, James Matthews, John Sweringer, Rev. David Phillips, Andrew Dunlevy, Daniel Townsend, William Fife and Robert Bell. Peters was initially a farming community and then later on coal became a major industry that resulted in the development of Hackett, presently a small settlement 1.2 miles (2 km) east of Venetia.

Peters Township remained a sparsely populated rural community until the 1950s. In 1950 the population was 3,004. By 2000, this number had increased to 17,556. In 1976, the township's home rule charter became effective. This altered the form of government from the prevalent Second Class Township Supervisor format to the present Council-Manager form.

The township's current arrowhead logo was adopted with the new home rule charter. An arrowhead found in Peters Township was adopted as the pattern.[4]

Peterswood Park, located in the township, is home to the Peters Township Recreation Center, as well as several football, baseball, softball, and soccer fields. In addition, there is an amphitheater as well as several pavilions.

The Enoch Wright House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.[5]

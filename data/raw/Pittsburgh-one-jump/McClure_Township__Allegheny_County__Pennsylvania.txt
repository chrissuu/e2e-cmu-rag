McClure Township was a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania within what is now the North Side of Pittsburgh. It was formed in 1859 from parts of Ross, Reserve, and Robinson townships.[1] Its original territory, bordering Allegheny City and Manchester Borough on the south and the Ohio River on the west, included the Woods Run area and present-day Brighton Heights.[2] Allegheny annexed portions of McClure in 1867 and 1870, and the remainder in 1873.[1]

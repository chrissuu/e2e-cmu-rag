McKean County was settled because of its natural resources of oil and timber, both of which continue to provide significant input to the local economy. Today, a university, rural medical center, federal prison and numerous manufacturing companies balance the area's economy.

As reported by EdNA, Pennsylvania Department of Education, June 2010.

There is one Pennsylvania state park in McKean County. Kinzua Bridge State Park is between U.S. Route 6 and Pennsylvania Route 59, just east of the Allegheny National Forest near Mount Jewett. When it was built, it was the highest and longest railroad bridge in the world. It was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of "Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks" and is a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. A tornado destroyed much of the bridge in 2003, and a skywalk and viewing platform have since been installed on its remnants.

The Catholic Radical Alliance was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1937 by the Roman Catholic priests Charles Owen Rice, Carl Hensler, and George Barry O'Toole,[1][2] with the approval of their bishop, Hugh C. Boyle.[3] It supported the unionization of workers in the H.Â J. Heinz Company and the Loose Wiles Biscuit Company in Pittsburgh.[4][5] In addition to union activities, it founded a house of hospitality, St. Joseph's, which is still active as of 2018. It disassociated itself from the Catholic Worker Movement during the Second World War, over a disagreement with the Catholic Worker's pacifist stance.[6]

UPMC is an American integrated global nonprofit health enterprise that has 100,000 employees, 40 hospitals with more than 8,000 licensed beds, 800 clinical locations including outpatient sites and doctors' offices, a 3.8Â million-member health insurance division, as well as commercial and international ventures.[1][8] It is closely affiliated with its academic partner, the University of Pittsburgh.[9]  It is considered a leading American health care provider, as its flagship facilities have ranked in U.S. News & World Report "Honor Roll" of the approximately 15 to 20 best hospitals in America for over 15 years.[10] As of 2016, its flagship hospital UPMC Presbyterian was ranked 12th nationally among the best hospitals (and first in Pennsylvania) by U.S. News & World Report and ranked in 15 of 16 specialty areas when including UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital. This does not include UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh which ranked in the top 10 of pediatric centers in a separate US News ranking.[10]

UPMC has its roots in the 1893 establishment of Presbyterian Hospital,[11][12] which serves as the medical center's flagship facility, and the 1886 founding of the Western Pennsylvania Medical College. Soon after its founding, the medical college became affiliated with the Western University of Pennsylvania in 1892, and in 1908, was fully integrated into the university which that same year was renamed to the University of Pittsburgh.[13][14] Already having worked out informal agreements for teaching and staffing privileges with a number of local hospitals,[15] Pitt and its School of Medicine desired to establish an academic medical center, and by the mid-1920s had formed a plan with a coalition of city hospitals to have them relocate to the Oakland neighborhood of the city that the university had itself moved to in 1909.[16] The university provided Presbyterian Hospital, then located on the North Side, with a tract of land on its campus for construction of a new hospital which broke ground in 1930 and was subsequently opened in 1938.[12] By the end of the 1930s, the University of Pittsburgh had helped to form the "University Medical Center" which included Falk Clinic, Children's, Eye and Ear, Libby Steele Magee, Presbyterian General, and Women's Hospital, as well as the planned Municipal Hospital.[17][18][19][20]

In 1949, a new affiliation agreement between the university and Presbyterian Hospital established a three-tiered mission of patient care, research, and education and by 1951, the hospital name changed to Presbyterian University Hospital in order to reflect its close ties with the University of Pittsburgh.[12] In 1958, the "University of Pittsburgh Health Center" was noted to comprise (1) Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing, and the Graduate School of Public Health; (2) Presbyterian, Woman's, Children's, Eye and Ear, and Magee Hospitals; and (3) Falk Clinic, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Child Guidance Center, Salk Hall, and Central Blood Bank.[21] Through the years, the university and the hospitals moved toward an ever-tightening alliance. In 1965, the university, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic which was managed by the School of Medicine, Presbyterian-University, Magee and Women's, Eye and Ear, and Children's Hospitals incorporated the University Health Center of Pittsburgh (UHCP). In 1969, Montefiore Hospital joined UHCP.[15]

In the 1970s, a new model of administration, in which clinical revenues were invested into research, was implemented at Western Psychiatric under the leadership of Thomas Detre. After guiding the psychiatric institute to become one of the largest recipients of National Institute of Health funding, Detre assumed leadership overseeing all six of the university's schools of health sciences in the early 1980s. Implementing the same administrative model in those units, the collective schools of the health sciences and medical center were ultimately transformed into one of the largest centers for biomedical research in the nation.[22]

Beginning in 1986, members of the University Health Center including Presbyterian University Hospital, Falk Clinic, the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and Eye & Ear Hospital began to consolidate. The consolidated group, re-termed the Medical and Health Care Division (MHCD) and led by Detre, became closely linked administratively, although Presbyterian University Hospital remained a separate entity.[23] In 1990, MHCD acquired neighboring Montefiore Hospital which it merged with Presbyterian University Hospital to form the entity that was then renamed as the "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center" (shortened to UPMC), which was the first time the current name of the medical center was officially used.[23]

UPMC then began to form a network of affiliated specialty and community hospitals in 1994 termed the Tri-State Health System and established a for-profit health insurance division, UPMC Health Plan, which contracted with these hospitals.[24] In 1996, UPMC had moved to acquire South Side, Aliquippa and Braddock hospitals. Meanwhile, UPMC began to merge with several of the already affiliated Tri-State hospitals including St. Margaret Memorial, Shadyside, and Passavant hospitals in 1997 and Magee-Womens Hospital in 1998.[24]

The acquisition and mergers of hospitals morphed the Tri-State Health System into a consolidation of hospitals that currently makes up a significant portion of the UPMC health system. Due to its immense growth of the medical center, as well as the university's concerns regarding the financial risks associated with its faculty practice plans in the face of national changes in health care reimbursements, the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC restructured their relationship and legally separated in 1998 thus launching UPMC as an independent nonprofit corporation[25] with the university identified as a supported organization in its articles of incorporation.[26]

The university consolidated its physicians' practice plans and transferred them, along with the university's hospital management functions, to UPMC, with UPMC providing ongoing financial support to the university and its academic missions in return. The result was a mutually exclusive partnership of close affiliation formalized by a series of interrelated agreements and mutual executive oversights, which includes the sharing of numerous board members.[25] This created a collaborative and coordinated decision-making model in which UPMC oversees all clinical activity, while the University of Pittsburgh remains the guardian of all academic priorities, particularly faculty-based research.[24]

Expansion of UPMC continued in 2001 as Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh began merging with UPMC.[11] Since then, UPMC's growth has continued, including a merger with Mercy Hospital in 2008; the opening of new Children's Hospital facilities in 2009; the integrations of Hamot Medical Center in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 2011,[27] Altoona Regional Health System in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in 2013,[28] and Jameson Health System in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 2016;[29] along with the continued expansion of overseas operations and for-profit business ventures. In October 2016, Susquehanna Health, a four-hospital system in north central Pennsylvania, became the first domestic hospital outside Western Pennsylvania to join the UPMC system.[30] Subsequently, UPMC Susquehanna merged with two additional community hospitals in October of the following year.[31]

In December 2016, WCA Hospital of Jamestown, New York, became the first domestic hospital outside of Pennsylvania in the UPMC system.[32] In September 2017, Pinnacle Health, a seven-hospital system in South Central Pennsylvania, merged with UPMC and concurrently merged with Hanover Hospital.[33] Cole Memorial hospital partnered with UPMC Susquehanna and merged with the UPMC system in March 2018.[34] Somerset Hospital, located in Somerset, Pennsylvania, merged with UPMC on February 1, 2019.[35]

On February 3, 2020, Western Maryland Health System became the first Maryland hospital to join the UPMC system.[36] Washington Health System merged with UPMC in 2024.[37] UPMC now operates over 35 academic, community, and specialty hospitals in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New York, as well as over 600 outpatient sites and doctors' offices, more than 50 facilities for physical, occupational, speech and specialty therapies, and 14 retirement and long-term care site, along with its international and for-profit ventures.[8][38]

Among the more renowned individuals who have worked with the University of Pittsburgh's medical center through its history are Jonas Salk who developed the polio vaccine while at the University of Pittsburgh, pediatric psychoanalyst Benjamin Spock, Peter Safar who pioneered CPR and the world's first intensive care training program at the medical center, and surgeon Thomas Starzl who perfected organ transplantation there.

Former UPMC hospitals include UPMC Sunbury in Sunbury, Pennsylvania (2017â2020) which was closed and services integrated into other nearby facilities;[136] UPMC Beacon Hospital in Dublin, Ireland (2009 to 2014)[137][138] which was acquired by Irish businessman Denis O'Brien;[139] UPMC Braddock in Braddock, Pennsylvania (1996 to 2010) which was closed;[140] UPMC South Side hospital in Pittsburgh (1996 to 2009) which was merged with UPMC Mercy and converted into UPMC Mercy South Side Outpatient Center;[141] UPMC Lee Regional in Johnstown, Pennsylvania (1998 to 2005) which was sold to Conemaugh Health System;[142] and UPMC Beaver Valley in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania (1996 to 2001) which was transferred back to its community board and subsequently closed.[143] UPMC Pinnacle Lancaster, formerly St. Joseph's hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, closed on February 28, 2019, and its services were consolidated into UPMC Pinnacle Lititz.

UPMC has committed to several community projects, most notably pledging $100Â million to the Pittsburgh Promise, a scholarship program to help students graduating from the Pittsburgh Public Schools pursue post-secondary education,[144] and $525Â million for construction of a new Children's Hospital.[145] In fiscal year 2012, UPMC donated a combined $622Â million in charitable community benefits. This included $96Â million in community health programs and charitable donations to help stage more than 3,000 community health improvement programs, $288Â million in support for research and education, and $238Â million for charity care and unreimbursed health care, not including an additional $146Â million to cover Medicare reimbursement shortfalls.[146] Despite its 60% market share, UPMC accounted for 78% of the care in Allegheny County's low income communities and 88% of the care for children living in poverty.[147] UPMC contributed $887Â million, or more than 15 percent of its net patient revenue, to community services in Fiscal Year 2013, and provides more care to the most underserved areas than any other health care institution in the region.[147]

The Center for Biosecurity at UPMC (CBUPMC) is led by Thomas V. Inglesby, MD. Their mandate is to conduct "independent research, analysis, and nonpartisan policy recommendations" to serve as "resources for decision makers who are responsible for strengthening US planning, response, and resilience to catastrophic events."[148]

UPMC has been criticized for excessive profits,[149] monopolistic practices,[150] excessive advertising budgets,[151] and focusing on overseas operations at the expense of domestic ones.[152] In addition, various controversies have received significant local and national attention in recent years. Over the last decade, it has often found itself the target of pointed criticisms from SEIU Healthcare,[153] which has tried unsuccessfully to organize bargaining units among UPMC's service employees and other front-line workers.[154]

In 2008, the administration and reporting of UPMC's living donor liver transplantation program received national attention when internal studies, spearheaded by transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl, questioned the safety of the procedure and ultimately resulted in the forced resignation of liver transplant program head, Amadeo Marcos.[155][156]  Another controversy arose in May 2011 for UPMC's live-donor kidney transplant program when a kidney infected with hepatitis C was transplanted into a non-infected person. The incident led UPMC to voluntarily shut down its kidney transplant program for two months, and resulted in the suspension of a nurse and demotion of a surgeon. Federal reviewers with United Network for Organ Sharing concluded human error at fault for the oversight and corrective plans that included multiple redundancies were instituted with oversight from the Pennsylvania Department of Health.[157]  Because of the botched living donor kidney transplant at UPMC, the federal Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) put UPMC's transplant program on probation, a rarely used form of discipline handed down for some of the most serious transplant errors. The OPTN said it meted out the discipline not only because of the kidney transplant error, but because UPMC's transplant program was found to have problems in its communication and documentation procedures before.[158]

In April 2009, rival West Penn Allegheny Health System filed an antitrust lawsuit against the UPMC and health insurer Highmark, claiming a conspiracy to create a monopoly.[159] The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice.[160]  West Penn Allegheny filed an appeal of this judgment.[161]  Upon appeal, the case was unanimously reinstated by the US Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

In October 2009, UPMC's administration decision to close UPMC Braddock hospital[162] resulted in multiple protest and lawsuits[163] by community groups who disputed UPMC's claims that the hospital was losing money and was underutilized.[164]  The facility, now demolished in preparation for redevelopment, closed in January 2010.[165]

In April 2013, UPMC has been criticized for paying low wages,[166] and using unfair labor practices to thwart efforts by employees to unionize, as alleged in the Service Employees International Union's complaint to the National Labor Relations Board.[167] In addition they have used noncompete agreements, preventing workers from mobilizing while suppressing wages. [168]

In March 2013, the City of Pittsburgh filed a lawsuit in Federal court challenging the tax exempt status of UPMC as a public charity, in an effort to make UPMC to pay back taxes. The city alleged that UPMC has abused its status to avoid paying property taxes.[169] The city dropped its lawsuit in 2014.[170]

In February 2019, the Pennsylvania Attorney General submitted legal actions against UPMC to enforce requirements for open health care access based on the non-profit status of UPMC.[171]  These actions stem from a long-standing dispute between Highmark Health and UPMC, the largest two health-care providers in Western PA.  In 2011, Highmark entered a partnership with West Penn Hospital System (now Allegheny Health Network).  Because of this competitive threat, UPMC declared they would not accept Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance.[172]  In order to protect public access to health care while agreements between the two systems unwound, both UPMC and Highmark Health accepted a state-brokered consent decree.[173] With the consent decree expiring in 2019, the Pennsylvania Attorney General attempted to negotiate continued access to care with both companies.  Highmark indicated that it would accept the terms while UPMC did not. It is the failure to accept the proposal that the PA Attorney General cited as leading to the legal actions of February 2019.[174] UPMC then counter sued the Attorney General in federal court claiming his actions were "anti-competitive" and violate federal regulations and due process rights, while accusing him of "intervening in a high-profile matter solely to advance his own political goals."[175] In June 2019, UPMC and Highmark reached a deal for a 10-year contract to maintain access across both health systems and all lawsuits that had been brought by the Attorney General, UPMC, and Highmark were subsequently dropped.[176]

In 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office filed a lawsuit against UPMC, University of Pittsburgh Physicians, and one of UPMC's top surgeons, alleging the surgeon was "regularly scheduling multiple complex surgeries at the same time, forcing him to move between operating rooms and sometimes hospitals, while requiring patients to stay under additional hours of anesthesia."[177] In February 2023, UPMC agreed to pay the federal government $8.5 million to settle a lawsuit accusing them of "knowingly submitting hundreds of false claims to Medicare, failing to follow medical standards for surgery and knowingly placing patients at risk."[177]

UPMC announced the closure of the labor and delivery unit at UPMC Cole in 2025, leading to protests from community members. Seven counties would be in a maternity care desert.[178]

The television medical dramas Heartland (2007) and Three Rivers (2009) were largely based on UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh's Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute.[179][180] In both cases the hospitals are fictionalized, but in the latter series UPMC is also specifically referred to as another Pittsburgh-area hospital.

Indiana is a borough in Indiana County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat.[3] The population was 14,044 at the 2020 census.[4] It is the principal city of the Indiana, Pennsylvania micropolitan area, about 46 miles (74 km) northeast of Pittsburgh.[5] It is a part of the greater Pittsburgh–New Castle–Weirton combined statistical area, as well as the Johnstown and Pittsburgh media markets.

The borough and the region as a whole promote itself as the "Christmas Tree Capital of the World" because the national Christmas Tree Growers Association was founded there. There are still many Christmas tree farms in the area. The largest employer in the borough today is Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the second-largest of 14 PASSHE schools in the state.[6]

In 1768, Thomas and Richard Penn, sons of William Penn, secured the southern part of what would later become Indiana County from the Iroquois Six Nations through the First Treaty of Fort Stanwix.[7] Indiana takes its name from Indiana County, which in turn gets its name from the "Indiana grant" of the First Treaty of Fort Stanwix.[8] Indiana was founded in 1805 to be the new county's seat from a grant of land by Founding Father George Clymer. By 1810, it had a population of 125.[8]

On at least one occasion, an anti-slavery mob in Indiana rescued a fugitive slave from extradition back to slavery in the South.[9] The town was also where James Moorhead, a local abolitionist leader, published several anti-slavery newspapers.[10] The first of these was The Clarion of Freedom, founded in 1843. Moorhead eventually sold the Clarion and founded a new anti-slavery paper, the Indiana Independent, which he published until his death in 1857. The Independent was published by his son J. W. Moorhead after his death.

The Indiana Weekly Messenger was published in the town between 1874 and 1946.[11]

Indiana County became known as the "Christmas Tree Capital of the World" in the mid-1950s, as noted in an Associated Press report. In 1956 alone, the county harvested about 700,000 trees, emphasizing its importance in Christmas tree production. In 1958, Shelton, Washington, also claimed the title, but Indiana County defended its status when local nurseryman Walter Schroth confirmed an order of 15,000 trees being shipped to Tacoma, Washington. While other states may now produce more trees, Indiana County was one of the first to gain widespread recognition. A reporter covering various "Christmas Tree Capitals" noted that Indiana County was the only one with official roadside signs declaring the title.[28]

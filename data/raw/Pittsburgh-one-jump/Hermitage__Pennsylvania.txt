Hermitage is a city in western Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 16,230 at the 2020 census, making it the largest city in Mercer County. It is located about 15 miles (24 km) northeast of Youngstown and about 60 miles (97 km) northwest of Pittsburgh. It is the principal city of the Hermitage micropolitan area, which includes all of Mercer County.

Hermitage was first settled in 1796 and incorporated in 1832 as Hickory Township from portions of the Shenango and Pymatuning townships. Following the incorporation of the cities of Sharon and Farrell and the boroughs of Sharpsville and Wheatland, the remainder of the Township was incorporated into a first class township.

The Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law was passed in 1972, allowing for municipalities to establish their own home rule charters.[3] A home rule charter in Hickory Township was approved on May 21, 1974, by a vote of 1,375 to 546, and was to become effective on January 1, 1976. The name Hermitage was selected in the November 1975 election, over alternatives "Mount Hickory" and "Hickory Hills", following a campaign by the Board of Commissioners. On November 8, 1983, voters approved by a margin of 1971 to 1846 to reclassify the Township of Hermitage to a city. Hermitage became a third class city on January 1, 1984.

On May 31, 1985, Hermitage was struck by an F5 tornado that killed 18 people and injured 310. It was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Pennsylvania. On May 31, 2015, the 30th anniversary of the F5, an EF0 tornado touched down in the southern part of town. It flipped two cars, damaged the canopy at a Sheetz gas station and downed a few trees and branches.[4][5]

In 2004, local politicians proposed the creation of "Shenango Valley City", a municipality from the merger of Hermitage with Farrell, Sharpsville, Sharon, and Wheatland, with the issue being put on the ballot in the form of a referendum.[6] Then-governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell voiced support for the measure and would be joined by Kathleen McGinty, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and Dennis Yablonsky, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, with the trio touring the region to urge for voters to pass the motion.[6] The city would largely be an expansion of Hermitage, whose city government would be retained, including the office of mayor and its nine-member city council.[6] The merger would have kept the various independent school districts intact.[6] The effort would ultimately be defeated, and via the ordinance, the issue of merger could not be brought up again until 2009.[7]

The neighboring borough of Wheatland merged into Hermitage on January 1, 2024.[8]

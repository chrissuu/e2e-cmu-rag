Deloitte is a British multinational professional services network based in London, United Kingdom. It is the largest professional services network in the world by revenue and number of employees, and is one of the Big Four accounting firms, along with EY, KPMG, and PwC.[5][6] The Deloitte network is composed of member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (/dəˈlɔɪt ˈtuːʃ toʊˈmɑːtsuː/ də-LOYT TOOSH toh-MAHT-soo) a private company limited by guarantee incorporated in England and Wales.[7]

The firm was founded by accountant William Welch Deloitte in London, England in 1845 and expanded into the United States in 1890.[8] It merged with Haskins & Sells to form Deloitte Haskins & Sells in 1972 and with Touche Ross in the US to form Deloitte & Touche in 1989. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, later abbreviated to Deloitte.[8] In 2002, Arthur Andersen's practice in the UK as well as several of that firm's practices in Europe and North and South America agreed to merge with Deloitte.[9] Subsequent acquisitions have included Monitor Group, a large strategy consulting business, in 2013.[10]

Deloitte provides audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk advisory, tax, and legal services with approximately 460,000 employees globally, and operates in over 150 countries.[4] In FY 2024, the network earned revenues of US$67.2 billion in aggregate.[4] The firm has sponsored a number of activities and events, including the 2012 Summer Olympics.[11]

The firm suffered a major cyberattack in 2017, causing a breach in client confidentiality and publicizing a significant amount of employee information.[12] Deloitte has also been subject to litigation regarding several of its audits.

In 1845, William Welch Deloitte opened an office in Basinghall Street in London, England.[13] Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the Great Western Railway.[8] He went on to open an office in New York in 1880.[8] The firm was based at No. 4 Lothbury in London from 1855 to 1905,[14] when it moved to No. 54 London Wall Buildings.[15]

In 1890, Deloitte opened a branch office on Wall Street headed by Edward Adams and P.D. Griffiths as branch managers. This was Deloitte's first overseas venture. Other branches were soon opened in Chicago and Buenos Aires. In 1898 P.D. Griffiths returned from New York and became a partner in the London office.[16]

In 1896, Charles Waldo Haskins and Elijah Watt Sells formed Haskins & Sells in New York.[8] It was later described as "the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants".[17]

In 1898, George Touche established an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 Broad Street in New York.[8]

On 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and managing partner of Haskins & Sells, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency. Carter helped convince Congress that independent audits should be mandatory for public companies.[8]

In 1947, Detroit accountant George Bailey, then president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey & Smart.[8] Headed by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated management consulting function. It also forged closer links with organizations established by the co-founder of Touche Niven, George Touche: the Canadian organization Ross and the British organization George A. Touche.[8] In 1960, the firm was renamed Touche, Ross, Bailey & Smart, becoming Touche Ross in 1969.[8] In 1968 Nobuzo Tohmatsu formed Tohmatsu Aoki & Co, a firm based in Japan that was to become part of the Touche Ross network in 1975.[8] In 1972 Robert Trueblood, Chairman of Touche Ross, led the committee responsible for recommending the establishment of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.[8]

Meanwhile, the head office of Deloitte's firm moved to No. 128 Queen Victoria Street in London in September 1964.[15] In 1972, Deloitte's firm (by then known as Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths & Co.) merged with Haskins & Sells to form Deloitte Haskins & Sells.[18]

In 1989, Deloitte Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross in the US to form Deloitte & Touche. The merged firm was led jointly by J. Michael Cook and Edward A. Kangas. Led by the UK partnership, a smaller number of Deloitte Haskins & Sells member firms rejected the merger with Touche Ross and shortly thereafter merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte (later to merge with Price Waterhouse to become PwC).[19] Some member firms of Touche Ross also rejected the merger with Deloitte Haskins & Sells and merged with other firms.[19] In the UK, Touche Ross merged with Spicer & Oppenheim in 1990.[20]

At the time of the US-led mergers to form Deloitte & Touche, the name of the firm was a problem, because there was no worldwide exclusive access to the names "Deloitte" or "Touche Ross" – key member firms such as Deloitte in the UK and Touche Ross in Australia had not joined the merger. The name DRT International was therefore chosen, referring to Deloitte, Ross and Tohmatsu. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.[8]

In 1995, the partners of Deloitte & Touche decided to create Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group (now known as Deloitte Consulting).[21]

In 2000, Deloitte acquired Eclipse to add internet design to its consulting capabilities. Eclipse was later separated into Deloitte Online and Deloitte Digital.[22]

In 1989, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged in most countries with Touche Ross, forming Deloitte & Touche. However, in the United Kingdom, the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged instead with Coopers & Lybrand (now part of PwC).[50]

While the full name of the UK private company is Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,[1] in 1989, it initially branded itself as DTT International. In 2003, the rebranding campaign was commissioned by William G. Parrett, the then-CEO of DTT, and led by Jerry Leamon, the global Clients and Markets leader.[51]

According to the company website, Deloitte now refers to the brand under which independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients.[52]

In 2008, Deloitte adopted its new "Always One Step Ahead" (AOSA) brand positioning platform to support the existing Deloitte vision: "To be the Standard of Excellence". AOSA represents the global organization's value proposition and is never used as a tagline. The recent launch of the Green Dot ad campaign also aligns with Deloitte's brand strategy and positioning framework.[53]

In June 2016, Deloitte changed its branding and adopted a new logo, with Deloitte written in the color black instead of the earlier blue.[54]

In India, Deloitte operates under several brand names, including A.F.Ferguson &Co., A.F.Ferguson Associates, S.B.Billimoria, C.C.Choksi & Co., P.C.Hansotia, Fraser & Ross and Deloitte Haskins & Sells (India).[55]

For many years, the organization and its network of member firms were legally organized as a Swiss Verein (the equivalent of an unincorporated association). As of 31 July 2010, members of the Verein became part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (DTTL), a UK private company limited by guarantee without share capital.[1] Each member firm in its global network remains a separate and independent legal entity, subject to the laws and professional regulations of the particular country or countries in which it operates.[56]

This structure is similar to other professional services networks which seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, DTTL and its member firms cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the IFAC Forum of Firms.[57]

In 2019, the U.K. partners in the firm received average pay of £882,000.[58] In 2023, the average income of Deloitte partners in the U.K. topped £1,000,000 for the third year in a row.[59]

Deloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country).[60]

Audit provides the organization's traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing, IT control assurance and Media & Advertising Assurance.[61]

Investors in Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings Company Limited have claimed that there was a failure to alert them to the company's poor financial position.[62] Deloitte claims it did a good job on the project. Deloitte's global CEO defended the firm's work on the Kelon matter. The firm was the auditor for thirty months from 2002 to 2004. It qualified its opinion in 2004 as to company sales, returns, and allowances. The firm resigned from the Kelon account after completing the 2004 audit. Deloitte said it resigned from the account because management at the client was not committed to best practices in finance.[63]

Consulting assists clients by providing services in the offering areas of strategy, analytics and M&A, customer and marketing, core business operations, human capital, and enterprise technology and performance. Consulting is Deloitte's largest business, bringing over 40% of total revenues in 2021.[64]

In An American Sickness (2017), Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal attributed to Deloitte a key role in counseling the adoption of "strategic billing" as a way of increasing revenues from hospital business. She dates this development from 2005, when Deloitte hired Tommy Thompson, former secretary of health and human services, as chairman of its global healthcare practice.[65] In 2011, Deloitte was ranked No. 1 by revenue in all areas of healthcare consulting—life sciences, payer, provider, and government health.[66]

The firm implemented the SAP HR system for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for $95 million and because of faults in the system, some teachers were underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all.[67][68] As of 31 December 2007, LAUSD had incurred a total of $140 million in payments to Deloitte to get the system working properly.[69] In 2008, there was some evidence that the payroll issues had started to stabilize with errors below 1% according to LAUSD's chief operating officer.[70]

The firm worked on a statewide case management system for the California Judicial Council which originally had a budget of around $260 million. Almost $500 million had been spent and costs were at one time projected to potentially run as high as $2 billion.

In November 2013, the international development charity ActionAid accused Deloitte of advising large businesses on how they could use Mauritius to avoid potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of tax in some of the poorest countries in Africa. Deloitte responded by saying that, in the absence of double-taxation treaties, they advise their clients to avail themselves of arrangements that could result in less taxes being paid to the countries in question. Deloitte also said it was wrong to say it is tax avoidance to make use of provisions in double tax treaties and that without such treaties investment might be reduced.[75]

In the late 1990s, Deloitte commenced operations in India, at the same time as another large auditing firm KPMG. In India, ICAI regulations do not permit foreign firms to carry out audits in India.[81] Hence Deloitte carries out audits in India under the name of C.C.Chokshi & Co., an existing auditing firm that it arranged an agreement with in 1998.[82] In 1992, after India was forced to liberalise under one of the conditions of the World Bank and IMF sponsored bail out, Deloitte was granted a license to operate in India. In 2004, A. F. Ferguson & Co., which has been in India for 110 years, joined Deloitte, following CC Chokshi & Company, Fraser & Ross, PC Hansotia & Company and SB Billimoria & Company.[83]

In May 2018, the UK-Based Financial Reporting Council (FRC) launched disciplinary action against Deloitte, Autonomy's auditor at the time of the sale. Deloitte partners who led the audit were accused of failing to correct false and misleading information filed with the FRRP, and otherwise failing to act with objectivity during the course of the audit. The FRC's action followed legal proceedings in the US that found former Autonomy executive Sushovan Hussain guilty of fraud earlier that month.[100]

Within hours of release, a member of Deloitte was communicating with the Insurance Bureau of Canada without the knowledge of CBA (their client) and providing confidential information. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta found Deloitte guilty of unprofessional conduct and fined the firm $40,000.[132]

In October 2019, South African power utility Eskom announced that it was suing Deloitte's South African affiliate, Deloitte Consulting, in order to recover R207 million paid for two consulting contracts that were improperly-awarded in 2016. According to the court affidavit filed in the Johannesburg High Court by Eskom chairperson Jabu Mabuza, in one of the contracts awarded to Deloitte, Deloitte bid R88.8-million while the bids from other consulting firms were R14.6-million and R13.3-million. In the second contract, Deloitte bid R79.1-million, and the competing bids were R16-million and R9.1-million.[133]

In an interview with AmaBhungane, Deloitte Consulting's managing director for Africa, Thiru Pillay, claimed that Eskom was trying to bully Deloitte into a settlement, He further stated that Deloitte had not conceded to being “complicit with irregular procurement” and denied "any undertone of corruption" with regards to the Eskom contracts.[133]

On 21 March 2020, Eskom announced that Deloitte and Eskom had reached an out of court settlement in which Deloitte agreed to pay back R150 million of the R207 million originally sought by Eskom.

Deloitte Consulting has been heavily involved in building unemployment insurance web portals across various US states, including Ohio, Colorado and Illinois. In May 2020, it was revealed that major security weaknesses existed in the web portals of these states. Proposed class actions were filed against the company.[144] This follows similar short-fallings in Florida's unemployment portal. The CONNECT site, designed by Deloitte, was described as a "colossal failure" as it was created over-budget, delivered late, and did not work. In May 2020, an investigation was ordered by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, finding that Deloitte ran insufficient stress testing.[145][146]

In September 2017, The Guardian reported that Deloitte suffered a cyberattack that breached the confidentiality of its clients and 244,000 staff, allowing the attackers to access "usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information".

The attackers were thought to possibly have had access from as early as October 2016.[12] Brian Krebs reported that the breach affected all of Deloitte's email and administrative user accounts.[147][148] A later report by The Wall Street Journal repeated Deloitte's statement that only a few clients were affected. Deloitte reportedly first noticed suspicious activity in April 2017. Deloitte said that its businesses weren't disrupted and no sensitive information was compromised, and that its investigators were eventually able to read every email obtained by the hackers.[149]

In October 2017, The Guardian reported that client accounts compromised in the breach included, but were not limited to, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Homeland Security, the US State Department, the US Department of Energy, mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the US Postal Service.[150] Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued statements saying they were not affected by the attack and denied that any of their data was compromised.[151]

Deloitte said that it immediately contacted legal authorities and six clients. Deloitte also increased security measures on the advice of both internal and external experts.[152] As of October 2017, the New York attorney general's office was investigating the hack.[149]

The subsidiary offers a variety of grades of thickness and hardness for the product.  Davy Rolling Company, a former British corporation, creates cast rolls, heavy duty rolls, and specialty rolls.[citation needed]

In 2008, their chairman & former CEO, Robert Paul, became a minority partner in the Pittsburgh Steelers, purchasing a minority stake in order to keep controlling ownership within the Rooney family.[6] Paul and his family acquired a 16% stake in the team as part of the deal, though the Rooneys will remain as primary owners.

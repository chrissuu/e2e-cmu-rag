Mahanoy City[a] is a borough located 38 miles (61 km) southwest of Wilkes-Barre and 13 miles southwest of Hazleton, in northern Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of the Coal Region of Pennsylvania and is surrounded by (but not part of) Mahanoy Township.

The name Mahanoy[b] is believed to be a variation of the Delaware word Maghonioy, or "the salt deposits".[3][4][5]

Mahanoy City, originally a part of Mahanoy township, was settled in 1859 and incorporated as a borough by decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill County on December 16, 1863.[citation needed] It was served by branches of the Lehigh Valley and the Philadelphia & Reading railways.[citation needed]

Mahanoy City lies in a valley in the Pennsylvania Coal Region and was a major center of anthracite production; the area was embroiled in the Molly Maguires incidents.[6][7][8] In 2010, the borough erected the Molly Maguire Historic Park, which features a Zenos Frudakis statue of a hooded miner on a gallows about to be hanged.[9]


The borough's principal industries remain the mining and shipping of coal, although the demand for it has steadily declined since its peak in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1930 the St. Nicholas Coal Breaker was built and went into operation in 1932. A controlled explosion destroyed the breaker in March 2018.[10][6]
Fire clay abounds locally. The manufacturing of shirts, bedding and foundry products is also fairly prominent.[citation needed]

In 1948, Mahanoy City became the first municipality in the country to have cable TV.[11]

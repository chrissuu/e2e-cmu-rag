Climate charts provide an overview of the climate in a particular place. The letters in the top row stand for each month. The bars and numbers convey the following information:

As displayed in the accompanying chart, Maribor has a temperate climate with warm summers and chilly winters. It lies in the northern hemisphere, so the temperatures peak in July and August. The temperature in Labuan, which lies near the equator, hardly changes through the year. Instead of summers and winters, there is a dry season in the beginning of the year, followed by a wet season with high rainfall. Cusco also lies in the Tropical Zone, but at a much higher altitude in the Andean highlands, and also much drier. Almost like in Labuan, the daily high temperature barely changes through the year, but they are significantly cooler due to the altitude. Nights in Cusco are much colder than during the day, especially in the dry months from May to August.

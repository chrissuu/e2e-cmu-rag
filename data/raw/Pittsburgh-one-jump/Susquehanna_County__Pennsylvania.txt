Susquehanna County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 38,434[1] Its county seat is Montrose.[2] The county was created on February 21, 1810, from part of Luzerne County[3] and later organized in 1812.[4] It is named for the Susquehanna River. The county is part of the Northeast Pennsylvania region of the state.[a]

The first non-Indigenous settlers began to move into the area from Philadelphia and Connecticut in the mid-1700s. At the time, the area was part of Luzerne County. As more and more people from Connecticut moved in, there began to be some conflict. Connecticut's original land grant gave it control of land within the northern and southern boundaries from present-day Connecticut to the Pacific Ocean. Their land grant overlapped with that of Pennsylvania. Soon fighting began between migrants from each state, resulting in the 1769–1799 Pennamite–Yankee Wars. In the end, the government of Connecticut surrendered its claim on the area.

In 1810, Susquehanna County was formed out of Luzerne County and later in 1812, Montrose was made the county seat.

After the Civil War, coal started to be mined. Following this, railways and roads were built into the county allowing for more people to come. At one point the county had nearly 50,000 people. Coal became, as with neighboring counties, the backbone of the economy. This boom in coal would allow for an age of prosperity in the county.

When the Great Depression hit, the coal industry suffered horribly. Within months, the coal industry was struggling. During World War II, the coal industry picked up again, but only for a short time. Soon after, the economy in the county failed. Many mines were closed, railways were torn apart, and the economy took a turn for the worse. Unemployment rose and population decline increased.[dubious – discuss]

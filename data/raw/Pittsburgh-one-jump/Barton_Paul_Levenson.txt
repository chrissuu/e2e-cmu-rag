Levenson's Japan-themed story: "Temple Cat", cited below, is reprinted in the charity anthology: "Healing Waves" from Sky Warrior Book Publishing and edited by Phyllis Irene Radford, who donated all proceeds from the sales to disaster relief in Japan.[8]

Reviewers consider Levenson's writing complex.[9][10]

Levenson's focus on science fiction started when he was eight years old, when his parents took him to the film 2001: A Space Odyssey[11] He described his writing process in a 2010 interview with author Sonya Clark, stating that he starts writing with either a broad plot outline in mind, or even one daydreamed scene. Often, the process will fail and the result is an incomplete work.[11]

One of Levenson's most cited essays, "The Ideology of Robert A. Heinlein"[12] has been reprinted in several languages (See Essays below). Levenson argues that Heinlein was making a case for the value of fascism. Levenson has been writing about climate issues for many years. His colloquies can often be found on: "Real Climate" *"RealClimate: From blog to Science".  Levenson, B.P. 2024.

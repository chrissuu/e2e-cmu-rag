The Allegheny HYP Club (Harvard-Yale-Princeton Club) is a private social club in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania founded on November 7, 1930.[2] It is located at 617-619 William Penn Place, in a building that was built in 1894 and added to the List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks in 2002.

On July 1, 1997, the club absorbed the Pittsburgh Club membership and assets[1] and in 2002 merged with the Allegheny Club in 2002 after the Allegheny had filed for bankruptcy protection.

In 2024, the club elected Christopher Profeta as its president. His tenure has focused on reviving the club's civic relevance by expanding public-facing programming, introducing monthly "First Friday" events, and forging partnerships with regional nonprofits and cultural institutions in Pittsburgh.

Middletown Township is a township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 46,040 at the 2020 census.  Many sections of Levittown  are located in the southern end of the township. The municipality surrounds the boroughs of Langhorne, Langhorne Manor, Penndel, and Hulmeville; much of the township beyond Levittown uses Langhorne as its mailing address. The township is located within the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

Also located within the township is Core Creek Park. The township also has many acres of protected woods, the largest being the woods behind Neshaminy High School. The Neshaminy Creek flows through these woods. There are also some few protected farms, most significantly that of Styer's Orchards, which was saved from turning into the site of 632 homes in the late 1990s.

Sesame Place is located in Middletown Township.[3]

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 19.4 square miles (50.2 km2), 19.1 square miles (49.5 km2) of which is land and 0.3 square mile (0.7 km2) (1.39%) of which is water.

Middletown Township was formally established in 1692 and originally included within its boundaries the present-day boroughs of Langhorne, Langhorne Manor, Hulmeville, and Penndel.[6]

Middletown Township began as a farming community, with close proximity to trading towns such as Langhorne and Newtown. There are not many significant historical places located in the township apart from homes and farms constructed in the late 18th century.

Middletown Township was sparsely populated before 1950: there were only a little more than 2,000 people in 1930, compared to about 46,000 in 2010. Then William Levitt began his second Levittown, which included land of four municipalities, including that of Middletown. Twelve developments were constructed in the township, with the majority of them containing hundreds of homes. This marked the first planned residential development in the township. Meanwhile, Langhorne Terrace was being constructed out of the Neshaminy Woods. During this decade, the township grew by over 440%, or more than 20,000 new residents. As the decades passed, its woods, countryside, and farms continued to be swallowed into homes and businesses. In the 1970s, the Oxford Valley Mall was constructed, and at the time was named the country's largest mall for a short time.

Growth continues to this day; however, Middletown has taken action. The township preserved hundreds of acres now known as Core Creek Park, which includes the sprawling Lake Luxembourg. Many woodlands and a few farms have also been saved. The township has transformed from a bucolic, rural area to a car-centric and haphazardly planned community, with rising crime and an award-winning school district. The township is still seeing a growing population, attracting many out-of-state residents and international migrants. 

Middletown is nearby the cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, and Princeton. Both I-295 and U.S. 1 pass through the township, which are at or over capacity with rush hour traffic.

Edgemont and Harewood and Beechwood are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[7]

Like much of the Delaware Valley, Middletown's immigrant population is skyrocketing. With many new, upscale housing developments, many of the households were bought by foreign-born residents. Middletown's immigrant population largely consists of Indians, Koreans, Mexican Americans and Russians. However, many other groups, such as Chinese, Hispanics, and Arabs, have growing numbers. Aside from European immigration, Middletown's immigrant population has mostly arrived after 1990.[citation needed]

SEPTA Regional Rail's West Trenton Line runs through Middletown Township, with the Woodbourne station located in the township and the Langhorne station located nearby in Langhorne Manor. SEPTA provides bus service to Middletown Township along City Bus route 14 and Suburban Bus routes 127, 128, 129, and 130, serving points of interest in the township and offering connections to Philadelphia and other suburbs.[14]

The township was once dominated by the Republican Party like most of Bucks County, due to a more bucolic, rural feel. However, after years of growth, including migration of peoples from Democratic areas, the area has been trending Democratic. The Neshaminy School Board and Middletown Township Board of Supervisors both lack a one party dominance, which used to be mostly or all Republican. 
In the 2006 mid-term elections, Ed Rendell (Governor), Bob Casey (U.S. Senator) and Chris King (Pennsylvania's 142nd Representative District), who are all Democrats, won the township. The heavily battled election between Mike Fitzpatrick and Patrick Murphy for the 8th Congressional district was split 50/50 like much of the area.

In 2024, member of the American Militia Movement Justin Mohn shot and beheaded his father, a Federal employee, and uploaded a video to YouTube calling for an overthrow to the United States government, displaying his father's severed head. Mohn was captured wandering on a nearby military base where he surrendered to authorities.[15]

Middletown Township lies within the Neshaminy School District. Students living within township boundaries may attend either Albert Schweitzer Elementary School, Herbert Hoover Elementary School, Pearl S. Buck Elementary School, Tawanka Elementary School, or Walter Miller Elementary School for grades K-4, depending on where they live. Carl Sandburg Middle School and Maple Point Middle School serve students in grades 5–8, and Neshaminy High School serves students in grades 9-12.

Cairn University, a private religious university, is partially located within township boundaries.

Oxford Valley Mall is at the center of the township's commercial retail area; it is surrounded by over 30 car dealerships and car automotive shops and over 40 restaurant chains, and several major retail stores. A number of furniture stores, hotel chains, a major hospital, and office buildings are also located in the Oxford Valley Mall vicinity.

Many homes have been constructed around the mall, the oldest being Langhorne Gardens, a branch of Levittown, Pennsylvania. Many newly constructed townhouses, condos, and large single-family homes have been built.  As thousands of people from other continents have settled near the mall, there is a wide variety of ethnic food, churches, and superstores in its vicinity.

Traffic has become a major concern. Nearby U.S. 1 and Interstate 295 allow commuters to congest the mall area roads, along with the surplus of residents in the area. Over 400,000 people reside less than ten minutes from the mall, plus the many commuters from nearby New Jersey. Many major construction projects are planned for the major access roads. There is a significant, and fast-growing foreign presence in the area.

Middletown Township is the home to the corporate headquarters of McCaffrey's Food Markets, an upscale regional grocery store chain which has locations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Middletown has a large mix of housing construction and time periods, which range from the fifties to new construction. Almost all the development that occurred in the fifties were the Levittown sections. Housing ranges from cheap single-family housing to exorbitant single-family living, and also townhomes, condos, assisted living, apartment complexes, deluxe apartment complexes, and 55+ housing. There are no trailer parks in Middletown. There are a handful of homes constructed before 1950, even a few dating back to the 18th century, however they are individual homes and scattered, due to Levittown being the first planned development. The most significant area with scattered housing periods is the area of Parkland. Houses date from every decade of the 20th century, and the 21st. Parkland has the lowest land value and family incomes than any other area of Middletown.

Sunbury (/ˈsʌnbɛri/ SUN-berr-ee) is a city and the county seat of Northumberland County in Pennsylvania, United States. Located in the Susquehanna Valley, Sunbury is positioned on the east bank of the Susquehanna River.

Sunbury's roots stretch back to the early 18th century. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 9,905. The city is one of the three principal cities in the larger Bloomsburg–Berwick metropolitan area.

Sunbury is connected to inventor Thomas Edison. In 1883, the Hotel Edison became the first building in Sunbury to be illuminated by Edison's innovative three-wire electrical system.[5] The hotel was later named in honor of Edison.[6]

Sunbury is home to the Beck House and the Northumberland County Courthouse. The Sunbury Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[7]

The first human settlement of Sunbury were likely Shawnee migrants.[8] A large population of Delaware Indians was also forcibly resettled there in the early 18th century after they lost rights to their land in the Walking Purchase. Canassatego of the Six Nations, enforcing the Walking Purchase of behalf of George Thomas, Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania, ordered the Delaware Indians to go to two places on the Susquehanna River, one of which was present-day Sunbury.[8]

From 1727 to 1756, Sunbury was one of the largest and most influential Indian settlements in Pennsylvania.[8] At that time, it was known as Shamokin, not to be confused with the present-day city of Shamokin, Pennsylvania, which is located about 13 miles to the east.

In 1745, Presbyterian missionary David Brainerd described the city as being located on both the east and west sides of the river, and on an island. Brainerd reported that the city housed 300 Indians, half of which were Delawares and the other Seneca and Tutelo.[9]

In 1754, much of the land west of the Susquehanna was transferred from the Six Nations to Pennsylvania at the Albany Congress. However, Shamokin was not sold and was reserved by the Six Nations, "to settle such of our Nations as shall come to us from the Ohio or any others who shall deserve to be in our Alliance."[10]: 215  According to Weslager, "the Pennsylvania authorities had no opposition to the Six Nations reserving Wyoming and Shamokin from the sale, since friendly Delawares, including Teedyuskung (also known as Teedyuscung) and his people living in those settlements--and any other Indians who might be placed there--constituted a buffer against Connecticut."[10]

The French and Indian War brought fighting to much of the region. The Delaware Indian residents of Shamokin remained neutral for much of the early part of the war, in part because a drought and unseasonable frost in Shamokin in 1755 left them without provisions.[11]

However, the Delaware Indians at Shamokin joined the war against Pennsylvania and the English after the Gnadenhütten massacre in 1755, and Shamokin was abandoned in May 1756.[12] Pennsylvania Fort Augusta was built in 1756 on the former site of the village of Shamokin. The Bloody Spring is a historic site from the era.

On March 21, 1772, Northumberland County was incorporated and subdivided.[13] The settlement was named Sunbury that same year, and the present-day city of Sunbury identifies 1772 as the date of its establishment.[14] It was named after Sunbury-on-Thames, a town in the Surrey borough of Spelthorne, England, just outside Greater London.

Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart and of Salieri, lived in Sunbury for some years after his arrival in America.

In July 1883, American inventor Thomas Edison installed the first successful three-wire electric lighting system in at what was then known as the City Hotel. At the city's 150th anniversary celebration in 1922, it was renamed the Edison Hotel.[15]

On September 29, 2020, Sunbury was featured on the Comedy Central television series Tosh.0 in a recurring video category called Shithole of the Week, a segment in which host Daniel Tosh takes images or videos of various communities found online and will select the "Winner" based on the comedic negative features based in that community. The image that secured Sunbury's placement was a June 2020 video of a man spray painting "WIGHTE LIVES MATTER" on his personal fence with the intent of spelling "White Lives Matter".[38] Nearby city Shamokin was a previous "winner" of the same segment in 2016.

The extensive Sunbury Riverfront Park Project is in the planning and implementation stages in Sunbury. An extensive floodwall protection system was designed and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1951. Additional height was added to the wall in 2003. The system has provided protection from 15 major flood events over the past 50 years.[39] In 1972, flood waters from Hurricane Agnes crested at 35.8 feet (10.9 m) at Sunbury, two feet higher than the crest in 1936. The wall held back the water and residents showed their gratitude in messages they wrote on the wall.[40]

It is inflated in May and deflated in the fall. The new waterfront development in Sunbury will provide a marina with transient boat docks, walking trails, gardens, an amphitheater and a new accessible fishing pier. Three acres of land will be added to the river side of the flood wall.

The city and state struggle economically, part of America's "Rust Belt".

The Greater Susquehanna Valley United Way in 2006 commissioned a study regarding what matters most in area communities. They found that some major concerns were alcohol and drug use among all age groups and its effects on the community, the dependency on social services and assistance across generations, and a lack of public transportation.[45] It is the intention of the organization to focus spending on these issues.

The site, an 11.6-acre (47,000 m2) former rail yard and plastic manufacturing plant, is to be developed into four, 2-acre (8,100 m2) shovel ready sites. It was suggested that the redevelopment of this facility will result in the creation of 120 jobs.[46] The site was purchased by Moran Industries, based in Watsontown, for $200,000.[47] Moran is using the space for food grade storage.

Volkswagen of America operated the Westmoreland Assembly Plant, in neighboring East Huntingdon Township from 1978 to 1988. Westmoreland, as VWoA called the facility, manufactured the Volkswagen Rabbit, Rabbit truck, Golf, and Jetta. With the downturn of VWoA's sales in the US, the plant was closed on July 14, 1988, and VWoA sold the plant to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It remained dormant until 1990, when Sony announced it would begin manufacturing televisions at the site.[7] The facility employed more than 6,000 by mid-1981[8] and still over 3,000 people by the late 1990s; however, that number dwindled to just 250 by 2007.[9] On December 9, 2008, the Governor of Pennsylvania announced that Sony planned to close the facility. As of 2010, the 2,000,000-square-foot (190,000 m2)[10] plant remains idle, the largest block of commercial space available in Western Pennsylvania.[10]

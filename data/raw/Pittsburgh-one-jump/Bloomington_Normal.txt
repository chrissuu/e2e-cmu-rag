The Bloomington–Normal Metropolitan Statistical Area, commonly known as the Bloomington Metropolitan Statistical Area or Bloomington–Normal, is a metropolitan statistical area in Central Illinois anchored by the twin municipalities of Bloomington and Normal. At the 2010 census, the municipalities had a combined urban population of 132,600, while the metropolitan area had a population of 169,572.

Prior to 2013, the metropolitan area consisted of only McLean County.[1] In 2013, the Office of Management and Budget revised the delineations of the metropolitan area to include all of DeWitt and McLean counties. Additionally, the Bloomington–Pontiac Combined Statistical Area was created to combine the Bloomington MSA with the Pontiac, Illinois micropolitan statistical area. The CSA includes McLean, DeWitt, and Livingston counties.[2]

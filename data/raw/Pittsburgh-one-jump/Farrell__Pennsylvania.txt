Farrell is a city in western Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States, along the Shenango River. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 4,258. The city is part of the Hermitage micropolitan area.

Once dubbed "The Magic City," Farrell sprang up practically overnight when a steel mill was constructed in 1901 on a plain bordering the Shenango River, near Sharon, in what was then part of Hickory Township (now Hermitage).

The community name was at the beginning South Sharon. In 1912, the population reached 10,000. At that time, the residents of the new city elected to take the name of Farrell, after industrialist James A. Farrell.[3]

The community was incorporated as the Borough of South Sharon in 1916; its population peaked at over 15,000 in 1920 and its status was elevated to a third-class city in 1932.[3] In 1939, artist  Virginia Wood Riggs was commissioned to paint the mural Myths of Vulcan and Juno in the towns post office. The mural was painted over in 1966.[4]

The mill, which eventually became known as the Roemer Works of Sharon Steel Corporation, would serve as the community's lifeblood until 1992, when it was liquidated after filing bankruptcy.  Many of the assets were sold at auction to Britain-based Caparo Corporation and later to Swiss steelmaker Duferco, which operates the plant today. Farrell was designated a financially distressed municipality in 1987 by the state of Pennsylvania.

In 2004 local politicians proposed the creation of Shenango Valley City, consisting of Farrell as well as Hermitage, Sharpsville, Sharon, and Wheatland with the issue being put on the ballot in the form of a referendum.[5] Then Governor of Pennsylvania, Ed Rendell voiced support for the measure and would be joined by Kathleen McGinty, Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, and Dennis Yablonsky, Secretary of the Department of Community and Economic Development with the trio touring the region to urge for voters to pass the motion.[5] The city would largely be an expansion of Hermitage, whose city government would be retained including the office of mayor and it's nine-member city council.[5] The merger would have kept the various independent school districts intact.[5] The effort would ultimately be defeated, and via the ordinance the issue of merger could not be brought up again until 2009.[6]

Despite years of population and industrial decline, Farrell has made progress in rebuilding itself due to new industrial investments on tax abated land and several new housing starts. [citation needed]

York is a city in York County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat.[5] Located in South Central Pennsylvania, the city's population was 44,800 at the time of the 2020 census, making it the tenth-most populous city in Pennsylvania.[6] The city has an urban area population of 238,549 people when taking into account people residing in surrounding municipalities.

Founded in 1741, York served as the temporary base for the Continental Congress from September 1777 to June 1778, during which the Articles of Confederation were drafted. It is the largest city in the York–Hanover metropolitan area, which is also included in the larger Harrisburg–York–Lebanon combined statistical area of the Susquehanna Valley.

York was also known as Yorktown in the mid-18th to early 19th centuries. It was founded in 1741 by settlers from the Philadelphia region and named for the English city of the same name. By 1777, most of the area residents were of German or Scots-Irish descent.[7] It was incorporated as a borough on September 24, 1787, and as a city on January 11, 1887.

York served as the temporary base for the Continental Congress from September 30, 1777, to June 27, 1778, during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Congress drafted and adopted the Articles of Confederation in York, though they were not ratified until March 1781. Congress met at the Court House that was built in 1754. It was demolished in 1841 and rebuilt in 1976 as Colonial Court House.[8][9]

York styles itself the first Capital of the United States, although historians generally consider it to be the fourth capital, after Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Lancaster (for one day).[10] The claim arises from the assertion that the Articles of Confederation was the first legal document to refer to the colonies as "the United States of America".[11] The argument depends on whether the Declaration of Independence would be considered a true legal document of the United States, being drafted under and in opposition to British rule. This does not, however, prevent local businesses and organizations in the York area from using the name, such as First Capital Engineering, First Capital EMS, and First Capital Federal Credit Union.

The Conway Cabal was a political intrigue against General George Washington that originated in the Golden Plough Tavern in York.[12]

According to U.S. census reports from 1800 through 1840, York ranked within the nation's top one hundred most populous urban areas.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), York became the largest Northern town to be occupied by the Confederate army when the division of Major General Jubal Anderson Early spent June 28–30, 1863 in and around the town while the brigade of John B. Gordon marched to the Susquehanna River at Wrightsville and back. Early placed York under tribute status and collected food, supplies, clothing, shoes, and $28,000 in cash from citizens and merchants before departing westward, obeying the revised orders of Robert E. Lee.

The sprawling York U.S. Army Hospital on Penn Commons served thousands of Union soldiers who had been wounded during the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg.[13]

During the Postbellum era (1865–1877), York remained a regional center for local agriculture, but increasingly became an important industrial center, with such industries as steam engines, railroad manufacturing, and papermaking achieving dominant status.

To this day, York still features unique architecture, ranging from colonial era buildings to large gothic churches.

The York Motor Car Co. built Pullman automobiles on North George St. from 1905 through 1917. An early and unique six-wheeled prototype was involved in one of the city's first known automobile accidents.[14] Another model was driven to San Francisco and back during roughly one month to prove its reliability several years prior to the creation of the Lincoln Highway which ran through town, connecting New York City and San Francisco.

The York area had also been home for more than 100 hundred years to the Pfaltzgraff company, which built its first pottery factory in the area in 1895 and continued manufacturing in York until 2005.[15]

Although currently produced by the Hershey Company, the York Peppermint Pattie was created in York in 1940.[16]

Throughout the middle of the 20th century, several incidents of racial prejudice and social injustices occurred in the city.[17] Between 1955 and 1970 there were several racial disturbances, most notably the 1969 York Race Riot, which resulted in the deaths of Lillie Belle Allen and Henry C. Schaad. These murders were largely left ignored until thirty-one years later, when allegations of murder and racial prejudice were raised against the mayor, Charlie Robertson.[18] Additionally, the city commonly held unopposed Ku Klux Klan rallies and public meetings, fostering further racial tension.[19] Though the murders of Allen and Schaad were solved and the perpetrators were apprehended, the actions, which originated back to the beginnings of the hate group, continue to the present day.[20]

In 2002, the city faced a budget shortfall of $1,000,000 (~$1.62 million in 2023). Mayor John S. Brenner's plan to raise the money by asking York County's 302,000 adult residents to donate $3.32 to the city received national attention.[21] The plan, referred to by some as the "Big Mac" Plan, did not raise all of the funds sought.

After many years of attempting to secure funding for a stadium and a baseball team to play in it, the first decade of the century saw York realize both goals. In 2007, Santander Stadium (now WellSpan Park), home of the York Revolution, opened in the Arch Street neighborhood. The stadium, along with other large projects such as the York County Judicial Center and the Codo luxury apartment lofts, have come to symbolize York's extensive redevelopment efforts.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.3 square miles (14 km2), of which 5.2 square miles (13 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (1.14%) is water.

York was the home of dental equipment and false teeth giant Dentsply Sirona until the company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina in 2019.[33] Though founded in New York by four men, the company moved its headquarters to the site of its factory in the 1900s, where it was run by one of the four founders, George H. Whiteley.  Whiteley was an experienced ceramist who was familiar with the process of making artificial teeth.  Whiteley was sent by the group to oversee the factory and his family presided over the factory for multiple generations. Dentsply Sirona is a NASDAQ listed company, and internationally known throughout the dentistry business.[34][35][36]

In addition, Christmas Tree Hill, a popular national Christmas, home decor and gift retailer, has been based in York since its founding in 1971. Its flagship location is housed in the historic Meadowbrook Mansion, which was built in East York during the early 1800s.[48] The six columns on the mansion's front porch were reused from the second York County Courthouse cupola, which had been located at 28 East Market Street from 1841 until it was taken down in 1898 to make room for the third courthouse.[49]

Much of York's culture represents the city's evolving role as an agricultural and industrial center. The historic York State Fair, which claims to be the country's oldest,[57] traces its roots to 1765. It runs every year in late July for ten days, encompassing an entire week and two weekends. In addition to typical fair attractions, such as rides, games and contests, it also wins regional recognition for hosting many musical artists, such as Alabama, Gretchen Wilson, Carrie Underwood, Toby Keith, and Lynyrd Skynyrd.[58][59][60]

The Strand Studio has also branched out and offers live music, usually jazz and acoustic, for the community. In 2017, DreamWrights underwent the largest renovation in its twenty-year history, adding a second performance space among other improvements.[68]

The York County History Center (YCHC) is a not-for-profit educational institution that preserves and uses its collections, historic sites and museums to encourage exploration of the history and culture of York County, Pennsylvania. YCHC maintains eight historical sites that demonstrate three hundred years of York County's history. The YCHC was founded in 1999 after a merger of the Historical Society of York County and the Agricultural and Industrial Museum of York County (AIM). Currently, the YCHC historical sites include the Worker's House, which was erected circa 1875, the Golden Plough Tavern, which was built sometime around 1741, the Barnett Bobb Log House, which was erected in 1812, the Bonham House, which was built circa 1885, and the old Eastern Market House, which was erected sometime around 1886.

In 1992, AIM acquired an industrial complex consisting of six buildings, which were built roughly between 1874 and 1955; three of the buildings were renovated and now house the industrial portion of the collection. The YCHC also hosts a variety of events throughout the year and holds the rights to the Murals of York, a group of paintings that depict York's history.

The History Center also purchased a former Met-Ed steam plant in York in late 2015 and plans to turn it into a new history center. In 2016, what was the York County Heritage Trust rebranded as the York County History Center.[citation needed]

The York Factory Whistle holds the world record for the loudest music without amplification from a non-musical instrument.[69] Every Christmas Eve, the whistle uses a compressor to create air pressure, then releases it through a series of tubes using a device much like a slide whistle. (Prior to 2010, the pressure was created using steam produced by a boiler.) The music has had a loudness of 140 dB and can be heard ten to twelve miles away with proper weather conditions. Christmas music is played for a short time around midnight. It is thought that this annual tradition was started around 1925.[70][71][72] Other sources date the tradition circa 1888 or earlier.[73] The annual concert has been performed by members of the Ryan family since the 1950s.[74][75][76] The factory whistle master since 1955 is Donald Ryan.[77][78][79]

After the New York Wire Cloth Company plant closed in 2013, Metso moved the whistle to its factory in York and continued the annual concert tradition.[80] Metso announced in August 2015 that it would close its York plant by the end of March 2016.[81] As of December 2017, the building was still owned by Metso and the annual twenty-five-minute York Factory Whistle Concert remained scheduled, along with two daytime rehearsal sessions.[82]

By December 2018, the hosting factory building was owned by 240 Arch LLC, and the air compressor (to be moved there for rehearsals and the concert) was trailer-mounted.[73] Another early Christmas concert and Saturday-before practice were announced for 2019.[83]

The York Revolution plays in the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. After thirty-six years without professional baseball, the Revolution arrived in 2007 to fill the void left by the departed York White Roses. The Revolution is named after the city's colonial past, when the Continental Congress met in York and passed the Articles of Confederation during the Revolutionary War, and continues the old baseball rivalry between York and the nearby city of Lancaster.[94] The Revolution plays at WellSpan Park in York's Arch Street neighborhood, which features a plaza and statue in honor of MLB Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, a one-time member of the aforementioned White Roses, with whom he made his professional baseball debut in 1955. Prior to his death, Robinson served as a special assistant and advisor to Opening Day Partners, the group largely responsible for bringing professional baseball back to York.

WellSpan Park has the distinction of having the tallest wall in baseball. At thirty-seven feet, eight inches, the left field wall of York's ballpark surpasses the height of the Green Monster at Fenway Park, the home of the Boston Red Sox.

The people of York (the White Rose City) and the similar city of Lancaster (the Red Rose City) across the Susquehanna River often engage in rivalry and competition that has its roots in the Wars of the Roses. Both cities take their names from the English cities, York and Lancaster, from which the opposing royal houses took their names in the fifteenth-century wars.

The War of the Roses All-Star Game was formerly played in York on Thanksgiving Day from 1983 to 2005. The game pitted the best high school football players in their senior seasons from the York-Adams League against a similar team from the Lancaster-Lebanon League. As the game only involved seniors and occurred during the first weekend of the PIAA District 3 football playoffs (players on teams which qualify for the playoffs do not participate), it is the final high school football game for each of the participants. As of 2023, there was some discussion about reviving the event.[95][96]

The program was aired as a seven-part series and featured different York citizens discussing race relations, racial perceptions, and the emotions inspired by the 2008 election. Norris stated that York was chosen due to its central location in a battleground state, its rich history (including its strained race relations), and demographics.[116] On June 19, 2009, Norris announced on the air that she was taking time off to write a book inspired by her conversations "with a diverse group of voters" in York,[117] and The Grace of Silence: A Memoir was published in September 2010.[118]

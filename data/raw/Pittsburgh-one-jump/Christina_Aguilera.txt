Christina María Aguilera (/ˌæɡɪˈlɛərə/ AG-il-AIR-ə, Spanish: [kɾisˈtina maˈɾi.a aɣiˈleɾa];[1] born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality. Recognized as an influential figure in music and having received widespread public interest, she is noted for her four-octave vocal range extending into the whistle register, artistic reinventions, and incorporating controversial themes into her music. Referred to as the "Voice of a Generation", she was also named a Disney Legend, in recognition of her contributions to the Walt Disney Company.

After appearing on The All New Mickey Mouse Club (1993–1994), Aguilera recorded the theme song, "Reflection", for the animated film Mulan (1998) and signed a record deal with RCA Records. She rose to fame in 1999 with her self-titled debut album, which garnered three US Billboard Hot 100 number one singles: "Genie in a Bottle", "What a Girl Wants" and "Come on Over Baby (All I Want is You)". Seeking a departure from her teen idol image, Aguilera took on a more provocative image on Stripped (2002), one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. After another old-school-inspired musical reinvention, she released the critically praised Back to Basics (2006). Throughout these periods, she amassed various worldwide hits, including "Lady Marmalade", "Dirrty", "Beautiful" and "Ain't No Other Man".

During the early 2010s, Aguilera featured on a string of worldwide top ten songs, including "Moves like Jagger", "Feel This Moment" and "Say Something"; the first of these topped the Hot 100, making her one of the few artists to peak over three decades. She also starred in the film Burlesque (2010) and contributed to its soundtrack, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination. Her concurrent ventures included a role in the television series Nashville (2015); roles in the films The Emoji Movie (2017) and Zoe (2018); becoming an ambassador for the World Food Programme (WFP); co-founding the company Playground; and serving as a coach on the reality competition show The Voice (2011–2016).

She has been named one of the most successful artists of the 2000s by Billboard and was listed among the greatest singers of all time by Rolling Stone. Aguilera has been regarded as one of the most influential Latin artists in the entertainment industry, having helped shape the "Latin explosion" in the early 2000s. Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013. Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, two Latin Grammy Awards, six ALMA Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, a Billboard Music Award, a Guinness World Record, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Christina María Aguilera was born on December 18, 1980, in Ocean Breeze, New York, at Staten Island University Hospital,[2] to Shelly Loraine (née Fidler) and Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera.[3] Her father is an Ecuadorian emigrant from Guayaquil while her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry.[4][5] Fausto Aguilera was a United States Army sergeant, and Shelly Loraine was a violinist in the American Youth Symphony before becoming a Spanish translator.[6][7]

Due to Fausto's military service, Aguilera's family moved frequently. She lived in Grasmere, New York before moving to[2] New Jersey and Texas.[8] In 1983, they moved to Japan and lived in Sagamihara for at least two years.[9] During her youth in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, Aguilera attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before leaving there to be homeschooled to avoid bullying she experienced at school.[10][11]

In 1986, the family returned to the United States, and settled in Pennsylvania, where they welcomed her younger sister, Rachel, in 1986.[12] Aguilera has spoken out about her father's physically and emotionally abusive behavior.[13] She noted that this is what made her turn to music, noting that, "growing up in an unstable environment and whatnot, music was my only real escape".[14] In 1987, Shelly filed to divorce Fausto and moved with Aguilera and Rachel to her mother's home in Rochester, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[15] She later married James Kearns and had a son with him named Michael.[16] In 2012, following decades of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her biological father.[17]

Aguilera moving to her grandmother's home allowed her to explore her grandmother's records, which featured mostly soul and blues singers and increased her interest in music.[18] She also began to practice singing in public and competing in talent contests.[19] Following numerous contests, she earned a reputation in her neighborhood as the "little girl with a big voice" and received widespread attention from local television and radio programs.[20][21]

In 1990, she performed the popular song "A Sunday Kind of Love" on the reality competition show Star Search, but was eliminated during the semi-final round.[22] Aguilera was eventually invited to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, and at the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.[23][24]

In 1991, Aguilera auditioned for the television series The All New Mickey Mouse Club (MMC), which aired on the Disney Channel. She ran against 400 candidates, and while she made the shortlist, she was ultimately rejected for not meeting the minimum age requirement.[25] One year later, in 1992, Aguilera received a call from one of the show's producers asking if she was still interested in becoming a "Mouseketeer". She once again competed for a spot (this time, against 15,000 candidates) and was selected to join the variety program the following year.[26] Her fellow cast members included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and JC Chasez.[27] During the show recordings—which included Aguilera performing musical numbers and comedy sketches—she moved with her family to Orlando, Florida.[28] In 1995, it was reported the series would not return for a new season.[29]

Aiming to begin a music career, Aguilera moved to Japan in 1997. She was selected to record a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi, with whom she performed in concert shows around the country.[30] Their song, "All I Wanna Do", was released as a single but failed to reach commercial success.[20][31][32] In June 1997, Aguilera went on to Romania to represent the United States in a singers contest during the Golden Stag Festival, failing to win over the audience.[33]

Seeking a recording contract, Aguilera recorded numerous demo tapes directed to record labels, including Walt Disney Records, for which she sent a cover of "Run to You" by Whitney Houston.[34] She eventually was chosen to record "Reflection", the theme song from the animated film Mulan (1998), which reached number 15 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.[35] Following the attention she received with "Reflection", Aguilera caught the ear of Ron Fair, the A&R executive from RCA Records, who consequently signed Aguilera to the label.[8] In late 1998, she began to record her debut studio album, for which producers reportedly invested over $1 million worth of writers, producers and vocal lessons.[8]

In May 1999, Aguilera released "Genie in a Bottle", the lead single off her long-awaited debut album, which topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks and became the second best-selling single of 1999.[36] The song became an international success, increasing Aguilera's popularity worldwide, topping the charts in over 20 countries.[37] The single also attracted the attention of conservatives including celebrities such as Debbie Gibson that spoke out against its lyrical content, and was eventually considered "too provocative" to be sung by a teen idol.[38][39] Due to the criticism, Radio Disney replaced the song with a censored version.[40] The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[41]

Aguilera's self-titled debut album, Christina Aguilera, was released on August 24, 1999, to critical praise, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200.[42] It catapulted Aguilera into fame globally and sold over ten million copies in its first year.[43] It was later certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[44] and it has sold over 17 million copies worldwide.[45][46] Originally, Aguilera's desire was to create material inspired by R&B and soul, but the label opted for a more teen pop production due the genre's high financial return in the late 1990s.[47] At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, Aguilera won the Best New Artist category for which Time credited the award for "[helping] certify her credentials as a real singer".[48]

I was completely blown away, shocked, overwhelmed and thrilled. I didn't expect it. I've dreamed of that since I was eight years old. I was rambling off the top of my head, my knees were shaking and I'm still floating on air because of it!

After the album's release, "What a Girl Wants", topped the Hot 100 and is recognized as the first new number one entry on the chart for the 2000s decade.[50] The song was also nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[50] This was followed with "I Turn to You" which reached number 3,[42] and "Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" which became Aguilera's third number one song and achieved worldwide success.[51] She also released a cover of "The Christmas Song" in November 1999, which peaked at number 18 and became the second-highest charting position of the song after the original in 1944.[52]

In October 2000, Aguilera also released her third studio album, My Kind of Christmas, her first Christmas album, which reached number one on the US Top Holiday Albums chart.[63][64] The album received generally polarized reviews at the time but has since gone on to retrospectively receive praise.[65] Aguilera starred in a holiday special, My Reflection, which aired on December 3, 2000, on ABC.[66] Aguilera's commercial success saw her being named the 2000 Top Female Pop Act by Billboard.[67] The same year, she also filed a fiduciary duty against manager Steve Kurtz for "improper, undue, and inappropriate influence over her professional activities". She eventually hired Irving Azoff to manage her career, aiming for control of her career and image.[68]

On January 16, 2001, Aguilera featured on Ricky Martin's "Nobody Wants to Be Lonely", which topped charts internationally and peaked at number 13 on the Hot 100, becoming her fifth top-20 hit in the US.[69] She was also listed as one of the most successful artists on the Billboard 200, Hot 100, and Mainstream Top 40 charts—for which the latter she was ranked among the greatest of all time.[70][71] The song was ranked at number 65 on VH1's "100 Greatest Love Songs",[72] and was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.[73] In April of that year, Aguilera featured alongside Lil' Kim, Mýa, and Pink on "Lady Marmalade" from the soundtrack for the film, Moulin Rouge!

In August 2001, Warlock Records released Just Be Free, a demo album recorded by Aguilera between 1994 and 1995 while she was looking for a recording deal following the end of The All New Mickey Mouse Club (MMC).[78] She filed a suit against the label and the album's producers, aiming to stop the release of the album; however, both parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[79]

With a new management, Aguilera started moving away from her teen pop niche and began working on a new project.[80] She cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and sporting several tattoos and body piercings.[81] Aguilera's new persona was widely criticized by media outlets.[82][83][84] In September 2002, she released the controversial song, "Dirrty", which garnered mixed reviews and peaked as number 48 on Billboard Hot 100.[47] The song's accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting overtly sexual fetishes,[85] and attracted the attention of conservative organizations and moralists who sought to have the video banned on MTV.[86] The video also sparked protests in Thailand and was eventually banned on the country's local television.[87][88] "Dirrty" topped the charts in the UK and Ireland,[89] and has gone on to become a cult classic.[90]

Aguilera's fourth studio album, Stripped, followed with a release on October 22, 2002.[91] She also executive produced and co-wrote the majority of the songs.[91][92] Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews but found commercial success and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, and eventually was certified five times platinum by the RIAA.[93][44] In the UK, Stripped sold over two million copies and became the second highest-selling album by an American female artists in the 2000s.[94][95] Since then, it was reported the album sold 12 million copies globally.[96]

Aguilera has named Etta James as a "role model", and said "At Last" made a major impression on her.[338] She later stated, "I'll still be as raunchy as I wanna be, and I'll have [Etta]'s memory to back me up. She's what I want to be someday".[339] As a young girl, The Sound of Music (1959) and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, became her early references to sing and perform, in addition to broadening her interest on Broadway.[340] Aguilera's other major influences include Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald.[341][342] She has also cited rock bands as an influence, specifically the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, and Radiohead.[343][344]

Aguilera was also influenced by Latin music. She later recalled singing her first songs in Spanish during childhood, saying: "I grew up hearing [Spanish] being spoken in my household [and] hearing a lot of Julio Iglesias on the record player".[345] Some of her other inspirations in Latin music include Chavela Vargas, Vicente Fernández, and younger artists such Rosalía.[346][347] As a performer, Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as major inspirations for being "positive female artists [who] aren't afraid to take chances, be daring, experimental and sexy".[348] Cher also encouraged her to be a performer and "a woman who has the guts to do [everything]".[349]

Aguilera's childhood visits to records stores moulded her taste and led to an appreciation for blues and soul music, which she called "music that really had heart".[350] Her music has also paid homage to many artists from this genre, including Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Nina Simone, and Otis Redding. Her album Back to Basics (2006) features inspirations of musicians from the early 20th century. As she later commented: "I was just so drawn to that [kind of music] ... [It] has so much pain, so much beauty of raw emotion and passion".[13] Her other influences in the genre was added for Liberation (2018), including Michael Jackson in "Maria" and Janis Joplin in "Sick of Sittin'".[351][248]

Outside of the music industry, Aguilera was inspired by actresses from the Old Hollywood.[352] She later stated, "I'm fascinated with the golden age of film. I wanted to capture the authenticity of the glam era", after which she cited examples such as Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Greta Garbo, Veronica Lake, and the pin-up models.[353] Her "Tilt Ya Head Back" music video also recreated Monroe's signature look, while the video for "Your Body" includes a reference to Lucille Ball.[354][355] The video for "Ain't No Other Man" presented Aguilera under the alter ego Baby Jane, which was inspired by Bette Davis's character in psychological horror film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[356] Her other inspirations mostly came from art works, including those by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Banksy.[357][358]

Critics have described Aguilera as a soprano,[14][361] possessing a four-octave vocal range.[362] She is also able to perform the whistle register.[363] Maura Johnston, a journalist with Slate, called Aguilera's voice "an instrument that despite its ability to leap octaves has a low-end grounding similar to that possessed by opera singers".[364] The Boston Globe columnist Joan Anderman highlighted her vocal versatility: "[She] is a real singer ... blessed with the sort of breathtaking elasticity, golden tones, and sheer power that separate the divas from the dabblers".[365] In addition to sustain high notes, Aguilera is recognized for making use of the melismatic technique.[359] Jon Pareles from The New York Times emphasized that "she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, and scalloping melismas".[248] Ron Fair—A&R executive from RCA Records—was impressed by her "perfect intonation", and concluded: "She's got the pipes to be the next Barbra Streisand or Céline Dion".[341]

Aguilera's singing technique also yielded comparisons to other singers. Journalist David Browne suggested that, alongside Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, she "forms the team of the main proponents" of the melismatic technique.[360] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post also noticed similarities with both artists: "She has a genuinely powerful voice that's evoked comparisons [to them], though it for the most part avoids those singers' ornamental mannerisms".[366] The New Yorker columnist Sasha Frere-Jones also credited the technique by making her become "a serious singer without needing to reincarnate the Sarah Vaughan".[367] Songwriter Steve Kipner praises Aguilera's vocal dexterity, including her ability to "internalize[d] all the riffs from Chaka Khan".[341] Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote that she possesses a "voice purely powerful as that of Etta James [...] and she's moving toward the expressiveness of Gladys Knight, if not Aretha Franklin". Powers also associated her vocal ability with Donna Summer when she performs records influenced by rhythm and blues.[368] Minneapolis Star Tribune noted that "She has the best voice of the bunch — big, rich, soulful."[369]

However, Aguilera has also been criticized for the frequent use of melisma, as well as for her style of singing live during concerts.[370][128] HuffPost columnist John Eskow called her "the main proponent of oversouling". Eskow praised Aguilera's voice as a "great instrument", though complained she did not "seem to know when to stop" with the use of "gratuitous and confected melisma".[371] Lucy Davies, music critic from BBC Music, raved about her "stunning voice", but offered that "she could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'ye-e-eeeh, woah' in her songs".[372] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman credits Aguilera's singing style as an influence of Mariah Carey, noting "her slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song".[373] Alexa Tietjen from VH1 acknowledged that Aguilera "does tend to take it to the extreme at times [...] but her vocal prowess is what's gotten her so far. Love them or hate them, the riffs are a part of who she is as performer".[374]

Aguilera's discography is generally categorized as pop, contemporary R&B, soul, and hip-hop.[376][377] According to critics, she has also experimented with other musical genres in her works. In a 2008 interview, she explained that she is "always inspired by new things" in music and enjoys "experimenting with [her] voice".[156] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian considered the "boldness in [continually] reinventing" her music as "one of her most impressive facets" as an artist.[378] Initially established as a bubblegum pop singer, she mixed teen pop and dance-pop on her first records, Christina Aguilera (1999) and Mi Reflejo (2000), with the latter also taking inspiration from numerous genres in Latin music.[366][379]

Moving away from the teen niche, Aguilera's post-2000 material mainly incorporated R&B and hip-hop.[376][80] Listed as an executive producer on Stripped (2002), she mixed both genres with Latin pop, rock, neo-soul, gospel, among others, while Back to Basics (2006) was described as a "throwback with elements of old-school genres combined with a modern-day twist [and] hard-hitting beats".[123] She continued merging R&B with other musical styles on Burlesque (2010), as well on Liberation (2018), which also features hip-hop, soul and blues elements.[380][381]

The show tune "Lady Marmalade" is noted as Aguilera's first musical transformation, which RCA Records initially felt was "too urban".[116][382] Despite the renewal in her repertoire, Aguilera continued producing power ballads—which became a signature in her discography—in between her uptempo material.[383] Kelefa Sanneh, music critic from The New York Times, observed the continuous modification in her music, in addition to highlighting her "decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely".[384] Her sonically drastic ventures include the subversive "galactic pop" on Bionic (2010),[162] electropop club on Lotus (2012),[385] and Mexican ranchera numbers on Aguilera (2022).[386]

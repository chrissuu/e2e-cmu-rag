Pittsburgh Riveters SC is an American pre-professional soccer team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Founded in 2024 and beginning play in 2025, the club currently plays in the USL W League, a pre-professional women's soccer league in the American soccer pyramid. The Riveters play their home games at the 5,000-seat Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square.[2] The Riveters are the sister club to the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC, a member of the USL Championship, the second tier of American soccer.

The Riveters were first announced on April 27, 2024, by the Pittsburgh Riverhounds staff, without a name.[3][4] A naming contest was held with public submissions accepted until June 21,[5] when the top four names would end up in a run-off vote. Supporters selected the name "Riveters" in the final round of voting, with more than 50% of the nearly 10,000 total votes cast in its favor; other finalists included the "Renegades" and "Strikers".[6][7]

Soon after its founding, the club announced it would debut in the 2025 USL W League season.[8][9] On February 11, 2025, the Riveters were announced as members of the newly-formed Great Forest Division within USLW's Central Conference.[10]

On May 16, 2025, the Riveters played their first game, a 0-0 draw against Cleveland Force SC, in front of a sellout crowd of 6,077.[11] The club finished their inaugural season with a record of 6 wins, 1 loss, and 3 draws, clinching the Great Forest Division title and advancing to the Central Conference Playoffs.[12] The Riveters lost their first playoff game to the Minnesota Aurora FC, 2-0.

Unveiled on September 18, 2024, the Riveters have a color scheme of traditional Pittsburgh sports colors, black and gold.[13] The badge features Rosie the Riveter, initially drawn by Pittsburgh artist J. Howard Miller was working for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's War Production Coordinating Committee to create a series of posters for the war effort during World War II.[14] The Riveters' badge was named the 2025 W League Best New Crest, winning 52% of the votes in the final round over Sioux Falls City FC.[15]

Pittsburgh Riveters SC will play at Highmark Stadium, a 5,000-seat soccer-specific stadium in Station Square. The stadium is owned and operated by the Riverhounds organization.[16]

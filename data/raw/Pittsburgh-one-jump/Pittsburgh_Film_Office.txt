The Pittsburgh Film Office (PFO) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation dedicated to economic development in the Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania region.

Created in 1990 to attract film production projects to the greater Southwestern Pennsylvania region, the Pittsburgh Film Office provides information on the region, locations, vendors and crew, and coordinates interactions between government and business offices in support of film production. In addition, the film office is a conduit for information, providing assistance to local filmmakers and the local film industry throughout Allegheny County and the designated ten county region.[1]

Since its creation, the film office has assisted with more than two hundred major feature and television projects, and has reported an economic impact of more than $1.2 billion on southwestern Pennsylvania.[1]

In 2007, the Film Office played a major role in supporting of the Pennsylvania Film Tax Credit, a program that allows a 25% tax credit to productions that spend at least 60% of the production budget in the Commonwealth. This tax credit has been a decisive factor in bringing the filming of several recent movies to the state.[2]

The Pittsburgh Film Office is a member of the Association of Film Commissioners International.

The Kaulig Companies Championship, formerly known as the Senior Players Championship, stylised by the PGA Tour as The SENIOR PLAYERS, is one of the five major championships on golf's PGA Tour Champions.  The inaugural event was played 42 years ago in 1983 and the age minimum is 50,[1][2][3] the standard for men's senior professional golf tournaments.

The winner gains entry into the following season's Players Championship on the PGA Tour (although Retief Goosen, the 2019 winner, was not allowed to play in the official subsequent Players Championship). In 2022, businessman Matt Kaulig, whose enterprises include LeafFilter and a NASCAR team, took over title sponsorship of the event, renaming it the Kaulig Companies Championship.[4]

Unlike the U.S. Senior Open, the Senior PGA Championship, and the Senior Open Championship, it is not recognized as a major by the European Senior Tour, and is not part of that tour's schedule.

Since 2019, the Senior Players championship has been held at the South course of the Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio; it replaced the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational that had been held there before moving to Memphis, Tennessee.[5]

The first four editions were at Canterbury Golf Club near Cleveland; the inaugural in 1983 had fifty players, no cut, and a purse of $250,000;[2] Miller Barber won the title and $40,000, sinking a  ten-foot (3 m) birdie putt on the final hole to finish one stroke ahead of runner-up Gene Littler. Arnold Palmer was seven strokes back, in a tie for fifth.[3]

Palmer won the next year by three strokes,[6] and successfully defended the title in 1985, winning by eleven strokes.[7]  Heavy rains on Thursday afternoon reduced the tournament to 54 holes in 1986,[8] and Chi-Chi Rodríguez gained the first of his 22 wins on the senior tour, two strokes ahead of Bruce Crampton.[9]

Through 2023, six players had multiple wins in the Senior Players Championship:

Three have won both The Players Championship and the Senior Players Championship:

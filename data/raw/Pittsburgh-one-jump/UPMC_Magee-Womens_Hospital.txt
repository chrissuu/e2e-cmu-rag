History of Magee goes back to the early 1900s when on January 19, 1911, Mrs. Alfred Birdsall delivered the first baby at a makeshift hospital in the former home of Christopher Magee.[4] The hospital is built on the grounds of the home of legendary Pittsburgh political boss Christopher Magee and named in honor of his mother, Elizabeth Steel Magee.[5]

As the county seat of Juniata County, Mifflintown serves as the county's center of business and government. Given the borough's small size, as well as the county's small population, the presence of business and government remain limited. The Mifflintown borough boundaries limit the size of the community, meaning that retail and business functions necessarily spill over onto land of bordering municipalities.

Nevertheless, Mifflintown serves as the corporate headquarters of both the Juniata Valley Bank and Pennian Bank. Empire Kosher Poultry, the nation's largest producer of kosher poultry, has both its headquarters and processing facility in adjoining Fermanagh Township.

Land surrounding Mifflintown serves as Juniata County's retail center as well.

Pennsylvania Route 35, a southwest–northeast highway that serves as Juniata County's principal arterial highway running in that direction, forms the main street of Mifflintown. It intersects the former mainline of US routes 22 and 322, which was moved in the early 1970s to a four-lane bypass lying east of the town. The former Pennsylvania Railroad mainline tracks, now owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway, lie across the Juniata River in the adjoining town of Mifflin.

Mifflintown is the home of Juniata High School, which serves the southern half of Juniata County. Tuscarora Junior High School and Juniata Elementary School are also located in the town.

Actress Nancy Kulp (most widely known as "Miss Jane Hathaway" on The Beverly Hillbillies) is buried in the Westminster Presbyterian Church cemetery. Physical educator Anna Scholl Espenschade was born in Mifflintown in 1903.[11]

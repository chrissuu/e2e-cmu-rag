Sarris Candies, Inc., is a specialty chocolate and candies company based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, approximately 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Pittsburgh. It was founded in 1960 by Frank Sarris.[1]

Frank Sarris (September 22, 1931 – March 1, 2010) of Canonsburg,[2] the son of Greek immigrants,[3] started his candy business in 1960 by making chocolates in the basement of his Washington County, Pennsylvania, home.[1] Sarris learned how to produce chocolate from lifelong friend and mentor John Macris, a fellow Greek and founder of Philadelphia Candies.[4] By 1963, Sarris had outgrown his basement, so he built a small candy shop next door to his house, and five years later the house was demolished to make room for an even bigger candy shop.[5]  Over the years, the company grew to include more than 350 employees and $16 million in annual sales, according to the company's Web site.[1]  In 1982, with the help of his son, Sarris created his very own old-fashioned Ice cream parlor complete with period-style, red and brass booths and shimmering crystal chandeliers.[5]  Today, the Sarris Chocolate Factory and Ice Cream Parlour fill an area the size of a football field with over 100 yards of chocolate, penny candy, ice cream and lifelike plush toys.[5]  Sarris' candies can be found at hundreds of annual fundraising events to kiosks in more than 500 Hallmark stores around the country.[6]

On February 3, 2012, the factory caught fire shortly before 7AM with 20,000 pounds of chocolate but has since been restored.

The town gained notoriety during the early 2020s on social media thanks to the borough being home to one of the last remaining Pizza Hut 'Classics' in the United States, located on the western end along Tioga Street. As opposed to modern Pizza Huts that have largely removed indoor seating and service and out of the traditional red-roofed locations that were a trademark of the company, the Tunkhannock location maintains much of the late 20th-century Pizza Hut aesthetic, food options, and service options.

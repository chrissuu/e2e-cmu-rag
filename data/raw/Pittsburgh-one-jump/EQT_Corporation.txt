In 1884, Michael and Obediah Haymaker struck gas outside of Pittsburgh, PA.[5] Four years later, the Equitable Gas Company was incorporated as a subsidiary of Philadelphia Company.

In 1950, the company separated from the Philadelphia Company and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[6]

The company changed its corporate name to Equitable Resources, Inc. in 1984. The company offered the first fixed bill energy contract in the U.S. in 1995. This is a contract in which the price a customer pays for energy is fixed no matter what the actual cost is during the life of the contract.[7]

Equitable Resources made a number of acquisitions in the late 1990s. In 1997, the company acquired Northeast Energy Services Co. (NORESCO) for $77 million[8] and a number of offshore oil and gas fields from Chevron Corporation for $80.6 million.[9] In 2000, the company acquired Appalachian wells and reserves from Statoil.[10]

The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in 2008, but removed in 2018.[11]

In February 2009, the company changed its name to EQT Corporation.[12] EQT opened one of the first compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling stations in the Strip District of Pittsburgh in 2011.[13] That same year, David L. Porges was named chief executive officer.[14]

EQT sold its natural gas distribution business in 2013 to Peoples Natural Gas for $740 million.[15] In March 2017, Steven Schlotterbeck became chief executive officer,[16] He resigned in March 2018.[14] and in November the company acquired Rice Energy.[17] EQT spun off its pipeline division, Equitrans Midstream, in 2018.[18]

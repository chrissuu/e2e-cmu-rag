Lower Macungie Township is a township in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, United States. The township's population was 32,426 as of the 2020 census,[2] making it the second-largest population center in Lehigh County after Allentown and the third-largest population center in the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area after Allentown and Bethlehem.[3]

Lower Macungie Township is located 7.1 miles (11.4 km) southwest of Allentown 60.8 miles (97.8 km) northwest of Philadelphia, and 95.5 miles (153.7 km) west of New York City. The township is part of the Lehigh Valley, which had a population of 861,899 and was the third-largest populated metropolitan region in Pennsylvania and 68th-most populous metropolitan area in the U.S. as of 2020.

Before European settlement, the area that now includes Lower Macungie Township was inhabited by the Lenape Indian tribe. They hunted here, and are known to have had a few small seasonal villages and jasper workshops close to streams and springs. Jasper from their quarries outside present-day Macungie and Vera Cruz was traded throughout North America.[4]

The name Macungie is derived from a Native American word meaning "bear swamp," or "place where bears feed." The early Pennsylvania German settlers took land that had been hunting grounds for the Lenni Lenape, adopting the Lenape name for the area. They cleared the scrub and forests, planted crops, raised livestock, and continually expanded their holdings. Most of what they produced fed their families and their hired and indentured servants, but some crops were grown for their cash value. Eventually they raised enough money to buy land warrants in Philadelphia from the proprietors, including William Penn's heirs.[4]

The Rodale Organic Gardening Experimental Farm, located in Lower Macungie Township, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.[5]

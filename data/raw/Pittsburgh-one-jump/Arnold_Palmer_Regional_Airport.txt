Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (IATA: LBE[3], ICAO: KLBE, FAA LID: LBE) is in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, United States, two miles (3 km) southwest of Latrobe and about 33 miles (53 km) southeast of Pittsburgh. It was formerly Westmoreland County Airport; it was renamed in September 1999 for Arnold Palmer, who grew up nearby and learned to fly at the airport.[4] The dedication ceremony included Governor Tom Ridge and a flyover of three A-10s of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard.[5]

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.[6]

Passenger traffic at the airport has significantly grown since Spirit Airlines began serving the airport in 2011, jumping from roughly 10,000 passengers in 2010 to 310,000 passengers in 2019, a 3000% increase.[7] Spirit Airlines is the only commercial passenger carrier and currently flies to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale and seasonally to Myrtle Beach.

The airport was initially established as Longview Flying Field in 1924. It became J.D. Hill Airport in 1928, then Latrobe Airport in 1935.[8]

On April 12, 1939, it became the site of the world’s first official airmail "Air Pick Up", where a Stinson Reliant aircraft successfully collected a mail container suspended between two poles without landing.[9]

In 1978, the airport was renamed for the third time to Westmoreland County Airport after the county in which it resides. In 1999, to honor golf legend Arnold Palmer as part of his 70th birthday celebration, the airport took its current name. Palmer grew up within a mile of the runway where he was present for the 1939 airmail pickup as a child and where he subsequently learned to fly himself.[8]

The airport was served by Northwest Airlink, as a reliever for Pittsburgh International Airport on the other side of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The airport had regional service by US Airways to Pittsburgh International Airport, until the company's bankruptcy. Northwest/Delta ended its service to Detroit on July 31, 2009.

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 18,946 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008,[10] 15,482 in 2009 and 6,978 in 2010.[11]

In February 2011 Spirit Airlines launched seasonal service to Fort Lauderdale and Myrtle Beach; in January 2012 Spirit announced they would start service to Orlando on May 17. The airline currently serves the airport year-round. Spirit now serves two cities from Arnold Palmer Regional Airport, and increased passenger traffic from 6,978 in 2010 to 355,910 in 2015. Southern Airways Express has expressed interest in a Latrobe-to-Pittsburgh route but no start date has been announced.[12]

In January 2020, airport officials announced a $13 million project using federal grant money to widen the main runway to accommodate any size plane.[13]

On September 3, 2020, President Donald Trump held a rally at the airport as part of his reelection campaign for the 2020 United States presidential election.[14]

On October 19, 2024, Donald Trump returned for a rally for the 2024 United States presidential election. The rally made national headlines because of Trump's suggestive comments about Arnold Palmer's genitalia.[15]

The airport covers 945 acres (382 ha) at an elevation of 1,199 feet (365 m). It has one active asphalt runway: 6/24 is 8,222 by 100 feet (2,506 x 30 m).[1] Runway 3/21 is closed indefinitely; it was 3,609 by 75 feet (1,100 x 23 m).[1] Runway 6/24 was formerly 5/23.[16]

In the year ending December 31, 2021 the airport had 38,822 aircraft operations, average 106 per day: 80% general aviation, 13% air taxi, 5% airline, and 2% military. At that time, 138 aircraft were based at the airport: 91 single-engine, 11 multi-engine, 31 jet, and 5 helicopter.[1]

The airport has a terminal building with one baggage claim. Long-term and overnight parking is free in lots B, C, D and E. Short-term parking is also available in lot A for a daily maximum of $10. Car rental service is available at the airport. Westmoreland County Transit Authority buses make regular stops at the airport, where a park and ride lot is located. There are also shuttle buses to nearby hotels.

Fixed-base operators (FBOs) on the field include L.J. Aviation and Vee Neal Aviation. Its control tower is administered by FAA but staffed through MidWest ATC.[17][18]

Plans are underway to expand the airport's terminal building, which will double the size of the existing terminal to about 90,000 square feet. The proposed expansion would increase passenger space, offer more space for restaurants and services, and include a second security checkpoint. The expansion is estimated at $23 million.[citation needed]

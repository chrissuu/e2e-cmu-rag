Kalamazoo (/ˌkæləməˈzuː/) is a city in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, United States, and its county seat. At the 2020 census, Kalamazoo had a population of 73,598. It is the principal city of the Kalamazoo–Portage metropolitan area in southwestern Michigan, which had a population of 261,670 in 2020.

One of Kalamazoo's most notable features is the Kalamazoo Mall, an outdoor pedestrian shopping mall. The city created the mall in 1959 by closing part of Burdick Street to automobile traffic, although two of the mall's four blocks have been reopened to auto traffic since 1999.[5][6] Kalamazoo is home to Western Michigan University, a large public university, Kalamazoo College, a private liberal arts college, and Kalamazoo Valley Community College, a two-year community college.

Originally known as Bronson (after founder Titus Bronson) in the township of Arcadia, the names of both the city and the township were changed to "Kalamazoo" in 1836 and 1837, respectively.[7] The name "Kalamazoo" comes from a Potawatomi word, first found in a British report in 1772. The Kalamazoo River, which passes through the modern city of Kalamazoo, was located on the route between Detroit and Fort Saint Joseph (nowadays Niles, Michigan). French-Canadian traders, missionaries, and military personnel were quite familiar with this area during the French era and thereafter. The Kalamazoo River was then known by Canadians and French as La rivière Kikanamaso. The name "Kikanamaso" was also recorded by Father Pierre Potier, a Jesuit missionary for the Huron-Wendats at the Assumption mission (south shore of Detroit), while en route to Fort Saint Joseph during the fall of 1760.[8] Legend has it that "Ki-ka-ma-sung", meaning "boiling water", referred to a footrace held each fall by local Native Americans, in which participants had to run to the river and back before a pot boiled.[9]  The word negikanamazo, purported to mean "otter tail" or "stones like otters", has also been cited as a possible origin of the name.[10] Another theory is that it means "the mirage or reflecting river".[11] Another legend is that the image of "boiling water" referred to fog on the river as seen from the hills above the current downtown. The name was also given to the river that flows almost all the way across the state.

The name Kalamazoo, which sounds unusual to English speakers, has become a metonym for exotic places, as in the phrase "from Timbuktu to Kalamazoo".[12]  Today, T-shirts are sold in Kalamazoo with the phrase "Yes, there really is a Kalamazoo".[13] For many years, this was even adopted as the city's main slogan.[citation needed]

The area on which the modern city of Kalamazoo stands was once home to Native Americans of the Hopewell tradition, who migrated into the area sometime before the first millennium. Evidence of their early residency remains in the form of a small mound in downtown's Bronson Park. The Hopewell civilization began to decline after the eighth century, and was replaced by other groups.[14] The Potawatomi culture lived in the area when the first European explorers arrived.

René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, passed just southeast of the present city of Kalamazoo in late March 1680. The first Europeans to reside in the area were itinerant fur traders in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Records exist of several traders wintering in the area, and by the 1820s, at least one trading post had been established.[15][16]

During the War of 1812, the British established a smithy and a prison camp in the area.[15]

The 1821 Treaty of Chicago ceded the territory south of the Grand River to the United States federal government, but the area around present-day Kalamazoo was reserved as the village of Potawatomi Chief Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish. Six years later, as a result of the 1827 Treaty of St. Joseph, the tract that became the city of Kalamazoo was also ceded.

In 1829, Titus Bronson, originally from Connecticut, became the first white settler to build a cabin within the present city limits of Kalamazoo.[17]  He platted the town in 1831 and named it the village of Bronson—not to be confused with the much smaller Bronson, Michigan, about fifty miles (80 km) to the south-southeast of Kalamazoo.

Bronson, frequently described as "eccentric" and argumentative, was later run out of town. The village was renamed Kalamazoo in 1836, due in part to Bronson's being fined for stealing a cherry tree.[18] Today, a hospital and a downtown park, among other things, are named for Bronson. Kalamazoo was legally incorporated as a village in 1838 and as a city in 1883.

The fertile farmlands attracted prosperous Yankee farmers who settled the surrounding area, and sent their sons to Kalamazoo to become businessmen, professionals, and entrepreneurs who started numerous factories.[19]  Most of the original settlers of Kalamazoo were New Englanders or from upstate New York.[20]

On August 27, 1856, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech in Kalamazoo during a campaign rally for John C. Fremont, the first Republican presidential candidate.  The text of the speech was found by Lincoln historian Thomas I. Starr in a copy of the Detroit Daily Advertiser and published in a booklet. This was the only trip Lincoln ever made to Michigan.[21]  In July 2022, a local nonprofit, the Kalamazoo Abraham Lincoln Institute, was given permission by the city to place a statue of Lincoln in Bronson Park to commemorate the event.[22]

In the 1940s, the city became the first to install curb cuts.[23][24]

In 1959, the city created the Kalamazoo Mall, the first outdoor pedestrian shopping mall in the United States, by closing part of Burdick Street to auto traffic. The mall was designed by Victor Gruen, who also designed the country's first enclosed shopping mall, which had opened three years earlier.[5] Two of the mall's four blocks were reopened to auto traffic in 1999 after much debate.[6]

An F3 tornado struck downtown Kalamazoo on May 13, 1980, killing five and injuring 79.[25]

On February 20, 2016, Kalamazoo became the site of a random series of shootings in which six people were killed.[26] A prime suspect was apprehended by police without incident.[27]

In the past, Kalamazoo was known for its production of windmills, mandolins, buggies, automobiles, cigars, stoves, and paper and paper products. Agriculturally, it once was noted for celery. Although much of it has become suburbanized, the surrounding area still produces farm crops, primarily corn and soybeans. Many landmarks and hiking trails are still based around the past celery industry.

Kalamazoo was the original home of Gibson Guitar Corporation, which spawned the still-local Heritage Guitars. The company was incorporated as "Gibson Mandolin - Guitar Co., Ltd" on October 11, 1902, by craftsman Orville Gibson. One budget model was named the Gibson Kalamazoo "Melody Maker" Electric Guitar. Operations were moved gradually from Kalamazoo to Memphis, Tennessee (Electric Division) and Bozeman, Montana (Acoustic Division) in the 1980s. Some workers from the original factory stayed in Kalamazoo to create the Heritage Guitars company.[29]

Kalamazoo was once known as the "Paper City" because of the paper mills in and near the city. The Allied Paper Corporation operated several mills and employed 1,300 people in Kalamazoo during the late 1960s. As the forests of West Michigan were logged, paper mills closed.[30][31]

Early in the 20th century, Kalamazoo was home to the Brass Era car company Barley.

Kalamazoo was also headquarters of the Checker Motors Company, the former manufacturer of the Checker Cab, which also stamped sheet-metal parts for other auto manufacturers. Checker closed on June 25, 2009, a victim of the Late-2000s recession.

Most of Kalamazoo is on the southwest bank of a major bend in the Kalamazoo River, with a small portion, about 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), on the opposite bank. Several small tributaries of the Kalamazoo River, including Arcadia Creek and Portage Creek, wind through the city. The northeastern portion of Kalamazoo sits in the broad, flat Kalamazoo Valley, while the western portions of Kalamazoo climb into low hills to the west and south. Several small lakes are found throughout the area. It is halfway between Detroit and Chicago along I-94. In addition, it is 50 mi (80 km) south of Grand Rapids and 75 mi (121 km) southwest of Lansing.

Kalamazoo's suburban population is located primarily to the south, in the city of Portage, and to the west in Oshtemo and Texas townships.

At least part of the municipal water supply for Kalamazoo is provided by the watershed contained within the Al Sabo Preserve[33] in Texas Charter Township, Michigan, immediately southwest of Kalamazoo.

Another watershed, Kleinstuck Marsh,[34] is popular with hikers and birdwatchers. Kleinstuck Marsh is south of Maple Street, between Oakland Drive and Westnedge Avenue, Kalamazoo's major north–south artery.

Kalamazoo has a humid continental (Köppen Dfa) climate. Summers can be hot, humid, and relatively long, from May to September. Tornadoes are rare but possible in Kalamazoo. In fact, in 1980, a major tornado ripped through downtown Kalamazoo, causing extensive damage. In winter, temperatures occasionally plummet below 0°F (-18°). Kalamazoo has been known for brutal snowstorms as late as early April, but some winter days have no snow on the ground at all. Lake-effect snowstorms are commonplace in the winter.

The area is also a hotbed for home brewing and partners with neighboring Grand Rapids to form what is widely considered one of America's more important regions in American craft beer explosion. In recent years, at least two community events have evolved from the growing craft beer industry in the Kalamazoo area (Kalamazoo Beer Week (annual),[54] Kalamazoo Craft Beer Festival[55]). In 2015, the Give a Craft beer trail and passport were introduced.[56] A shuttle bus (Kalamazoo Brew Bus) service[57] and party bike tour service[58] became available in 2016.

The station was originally owned and operated by famous broadcasting pioneer (and former Detroit Tigers owner) John Fetzer, as "WKZO-TV". Along with television, Fetzer introduced Kalamazoo to radio in 1931, when AM 590 WKZO signed on the air. Fetzer also created Kalamazoo's first cable television system, then known as Fetzer Cablevision; it is a predecessor of Kalamazoo's current cable franchise, Charter Communications.

Public Media Network, located in downtown Kalamazoo, hosts media outlets, including Charter cable channels 187-191 where daily public access programs are produced and aired to the public.

Kalamazoo is served by highways I-94, US 131, M-96 and M-343. It was on the original Territorial Road in Michigan of the 19th century, which started in Detroit and ran to Lake Michigan. Much of that, but not all, later became Old US 12—the "old" designation came about when I-94 was built parallel to it—and also was called Red Arrow Highway after a World War I army division. The name "US 12" was shifted south to what once was US 112 between Detroit and New Buffalo. Some parts of Old US 12 outside of town, especially in Van Buren and Berrien counties to the west, are still called Red Arrow Highway. The term "Old US 12" has faded from use.

The Kal-Haven Trail, heavily used by cyclists, runners, walkers, and snowmobilers, extends to downtown Kalamazoo. It runs 34 miles (55 km) between South Haven, to a trailhead just west of Kalamazoo. Between that trailhead and South Haven the trail is run by Van Buren County, even the parts within Kalamazoo County. A trail pass is no longer required. The Kal-Haven is a rail trail, built on the former right-of-way of the Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad.

The section east of the trailhead was opened in 2008 and extends to downtown Kalamazoo. It is known as the Kalamazoo River Valley Trail and is run by Kalamazoo County. No pass is required on that section.

Kalamazoo's name is a familiar reference in popular music, since its unique sound makes it a "great word for a lyric."[124] Its use as metonym for a remote place is discussed above—"although when it comes to both Timbuktu and Kalamazoo, most of that brag-worthy exotic allure is merely in their names."[12] Nonetheless, numerous songs use the city's name in their song title or lyrics.

Probably the first and most famous was "(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo" (1942) by the Glenn Miller Orchestra with Tex Beneke. The song was written by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren. It was recreated by the fictional Gene Morrison Orchestra (performing as the Glenn Miller Orchestra) and the Nicholas Brothers (performing the song as part of a dance sequence) in the 1942 movie Orchestra Wives.[125][126] It was nominated for Best Original Song at the 15th Academy Awards (music by Harry Warren; lyrics by Mack Gordon).[126][127]

At least a dozen (and many more versions) of "Kalamazoo" songs have been recorded. In chronological order, others include: "I've Been Everywhere" (1962) by Hank Snow (from the album of the same title)[128] and the 1996 song "Unchained" (also from the album of the same name) by Johnny Cash[129]—reworked from the original 1959 Geoff Mack Australian-place-names version made popular by the singer Lucky Starr, "Down on the Corner" (1969) by Creedence Clearwater Revival on their fourth studio album, Willy and the Poor Boys—covered by a dozen other groups—though the reference is not to the city but to the "Kalamazoo" line of budget priced guitars manufactured by Gibson,[130] "Kalamazoo" (1995) by Luna on Penthouse,[131] "Cold Rock a Party" (1996) by MC Lyte on Bad as I Wanna B,[132] "Kalamazoo" (1997) by the rock trio Primus on Brown Album,[133] "Top of the World" (1999) by Rascalz on Global Warning,[134] "Isn't It Love" (2001) by Andrew Peterson on Clear to Venus (at one point, he sings that he lost his luggage in Kalamazoo), "Kalamazoo" (2002) by Mike Craver on Shining Down,[135] "Kalamazoo" (2004) by Ben Folds on the EP Super D,[136][137][138] and "Kalamazoo" (2017) by The Show Ponies on their album How It All Goes Down.[139]

The city was also mentioned in the opera Einstein on the Beach by Philip Glass and in the chorus of the song "Gotta Get Away" by The Black Keys, from their album Turn Blue ("I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo/Just to get away from you...").[140] Like Miller, the Creedence and Axton lyrics probably use the word "Kalamazoo" as an oblique reference to Gibson, which made various models named "Kalamazoo" that were all prominently adorned with the city's name as their origin. In 2011, rap artist Young Jeezy mentioned the city in the song "Higher Learning" on his album TM:103 Hustlerz Ambition. In 2014, Kalamazoo was mentioned again by Rittz in the song "Bounce" on his album Next to Nothing.[124][141]

The "Kalamazoo" was one of several names of a railroad handcar that was produced by the Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company.[142]

In Dr. Seuss's classic children's book Horton Hatches the Egg, Horton the Elephant visits Kalamazoo while he is in the circus.

The 2010 film Cherry was filmed in Kalamazoo.[143]

The city of Kalamazoo, Michigan has three sister cities.

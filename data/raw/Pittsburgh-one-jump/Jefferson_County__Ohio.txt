Jefferson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio. As of the 2020 census, the population was 65,249.[2] Its county seat is Steubenville.[3] The county is named for Thomas Jefferson, who was vice president at the time of its creation.[4]

Jefferson County is part of the Weirton–Steubenville, WV–OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Pittsburgh–New Castle–Weirton, PA–WV–OH Combined Statistical Area.[5]

Jefferson County was organized on July 29, 1797, by proclamation of Governor Arthur St. Clair, six years before Ohio was granted statehood. Its boundaries were originally quite large, including all of northeastern Ohio east of the Cuyahoga River, but it was divided and redrawn several times before assuming its present-day boundaries in 1833, after the formation of neighboring Carroll County.

In 1786, the United States built Fort Steuben to protect the government surveyors mapping the land west of the Ohio River. When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement La Belle. When the county was created in 1797, La Belle was selected as the County seat. The town was subsequently renamed Steubenville, in honor of the abandoned fort.

During the first half of the 19th century, Steubenville was primarily a port town, and the rest of the county consisted of small villages and farms. However, in 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft, resulting in Jefferson County becoming one of the leading centers of the new Industrial Revolution.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 411 square miles (1,060 km2), of which 408 square miles (1,060 km2) is land and 2.6 square miles (6.7 km2) (0.6%) is water.[6]

Like many Appalachian counties, Jefferson County was a strong Democratic county in the 20th century. However, since the turn of the 21st century, it has become much more competitive and even moved towards the Republicans during the Democratic years of 2008 and 2012. In 2012, Mitt Romney became the first Republican candidate to win the county since it voted for President Nixon in the 1972 presidential election.

Carpenter's Fort, or Carpenter's Station as it was sometimes called, was established in the summer of 1781 when John Carpenter built a fortified house above the mouth of Short Creek on the Ohio side of the Ohio River in Coshocton County, but now in Jefferson County, Ohio, near Rayland, Ohio.[30][31]

I removed Alcoa from this list, as it is no longer based in Pittsburgh. See this Post-Gazette article: http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06058/661831-28.stm

Let's the world know that some Brazilian dude's trophy wife's longing to live on Park Avenue doesn't make the headquarters move, good thing the CEO has a cable internet connection, after she gets mugged maybe she'll want to come back to the safest metro area in the world again.  In the mean time some rubber stamp letting the CEO have peace in the bedroom hasn't changed how the headquarters are documented for Alcoa.  

By the way nice change in the color, IMHO great choice!Marketdiamond 04:43, 22 May 2006 (UTC)[reply]

OK, I love Sheetz as much as the next person in Western PA, but they're based in Altoona, which is far enough away from Pittsburgh to be a separate market. (It's actually slightly closer to Harrisburg, if I'm right, or around halfway at least.) I recommend removing Sheetz from this template. Jgera5 06:36, 3 October 2007 (UTC)[reply]

Monroe County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 168,327.[2] Its county seat is Stroudsburg.[3] The county is part of the Northeast Pennsylvania region of the state.[a] The county was formed from sections of Northampton and Pike counties on April 1, 1836.[4] It was named in honor of James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States. 

The county borders Northampton County and the Lehigh Valley to its south, Pike and Wayne counties to its north, Carbon and Luzerne counties to its west, and the Delaware River and Warren County, New Jersey to its east. It is part of the New York metropolitan area, but also receives media from the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and Philadelphia radio and television markets.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Monroe County was one of the fastest-growing counties in Pennsylvania, largely due to Pocono Mountain-related tourism and partly due to an influx of residents from New York City and its metropolitan area who sought a lower cost of living while still being close enough to commute to the city.[5] The population increased by over 70% from 1990 to 2010, and the commercial and retail sectors expanded significantly, although population growth has since slowed.

The county is home to East Stroudsburg University.

The Lehigh River, a 109-mile-long (175 km) tributary of the Delaware River, flows southward through Monroe County and then into the Lehigh Valley, where it joins the Delaware River in Easton, Pennsylvania.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 617 square miles (1,600 km2), of which 608 square miles (1,570 km2) is land and 9.0 square miles (23 km2) (1.5%) is water.[6] It has a humid continental climate (Dfb except for some Dfa in the southern and SE tiers) and the hardiness zone ranges from 5a to 6b. The area code is 570, except in the southwest where the Kunkletown exchange uses 610.

As of the census[12] of 2010, there were 169,842 people, 49,454 households, and 36,447 families residing in the county. The population density was 228 inhabitants per square mile (88/km2). There were 67,581 housing units at an average density of 111 units per square mile (43/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 70.5% White Non-Hispanic, 13.2% Black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 4.3% from other races, and 2.9% from two or more races. 13.1% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 19.9% were of German, 16.8% Irish, 14.5% Italian, 8.8% Pennsylvania German, 5.4% Polish, 5.1% American and 5.1% English ancestry.

There were 49,454 households, out of which 36.20% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.70% were married couples living together, 8.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.30% were non-families. 20.20% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.73 and the average family size was 3.16.

As of the end of 2021, the median value of all homes in Monroe County was $210,972, an increase of 13% since the prior year.[13]

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget has designated Monroe County as the East Stroudsburg, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area.[15] Prior to 2023, the area was designated as a metropolitan area.[16] As of the 2010 census the Metro area had a population of 169,842. The area ranks 12th most populous in the state of Pennsylvania and ranks 244th most populous in the United States.

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget has also designated Monroe County as part of the larger Allentown-Bethlehem-East Stroudsburg, PA-NJ Combined Statistical Area.[16] As of the 2020 US Census, the population of the CSA was 1,030,216, making it the third most populous Combined Statistical Area in Pennsylvania, and the 59th most populous in the United States. Monroe County was once part of the New York CSA, but as of 2023, Pike County is the only county in Pennsylvania grouped with New York's CSA.

In the 19th and early 20th century, Monroe was the most Democratic county in Pennsylvania. For much of the second half of the 20th century, Monroe County was a Republican stronghold. However, in recent years, party registration has leaned toward the Democratic Party, a result of continued migration to the county by former New York City residents, many of whom are Democrats. While in the 2004 U.S. presidential election the county was carried by Republican George W. Bush by a margin of four votes, beginning with the first campaign (2008) of Barack Obama, Democratic candidates carried Monroe County. In that election Obama carried the county by a 17-point margin, 58% to 41%–the first Democrat to win the county since 1964, and only the second since 1940. The other three 2008 statewide Democratic candidates also carried the county handily. Additionally, the Democratic presidential candidates carried the county in 2012 (Obama), 2016 (Hillary Clinton), and 2020 (Joe Biden). The Democratic streak ended in 2024 when Republican Donald Trump narrowly flipped the county, becoming the first Republican to win the county in two decades.

As of November 11, 2024, there are 120,056 registered voters in Monroe County.

New Jersey Transit is restoring train tracks in northwestern New Jersey along the Lackawanna Cut-off. This would, potentially, also involve the train to go to Scranton from Hoboken, which would go through the Poconos, marking the first time since the early 1970s when the Erie Lackawanna Railroad stopped running daily trains through the area.

The Appalachian Trail passes through Monroe County. David Pierce wrote in the Pocono Record, "The 2,184-mile [3,515 km] public footpath—from Georgia to Maine—has a particularly scenic but rugged section that straddles Monroe County’s southern border..." He stated that "trail hiking has long been an integral part of Monroe County's identity..."[31]

Two of the earliest Pocono resorts, founded by rival factions of the Philadelphia Quaker community, were located in Monroe County: Inn at Buck Hill Falls (1901) and Pocono Manor (1902).[42][43][44]  These resorts did not allow liquor or dancing, and evening dress was discouraged.[45] The Quakers "brought a quiet, unostentatious style to the region,"[45] but their hotels later developed from religious retreats into "luxurious mountain resorts."[46] Buck Hill's stone facade became a model for close to 300 stately stone-and-shingle homes in the region.[45] Pocono Manor offers sweeping vistas of the eastern and western Pocono region and has been referred to as the "Grand Lady of the Mountains."[47] Buck Hill closed in 1990 and the Inn at Pocono Manor was mostly destroyed by fire in 2019.[45][48]

Skytop Lodge, built in 1928, is also located in Monroe County and has been described as a "Dutch Colonial-style manor house."[44][49] Designed in reaction to the Quaker resorts, it had a dance floor and served liquor in a basement bar.[45] Skytop offers thirty miles of hiking trails, and the main building "is surrounded by 5,000 acres (20 km2) of wood, glacial bogs, hemlock gorges, beaver marshes, and cascading waterfalls."[47]

Tillinghast.[50][51][52] Bandleader Fred Waring purchased the resort in 1943, renamed it the Shawnee Inn, and broadcast his radio shows from there.[53] The Shawnee Inn is a Spanish colonial revival building with white-Moorish architecture and Spanish tiled roofs,[45] and it was identified in the 1990s as the only resort on the banks of the Delaware River.[54][55]

Mount Airy Lodge, which expanded from an eight-room inn into the largest Pocono resort, was located in Monroe County.[56][57]  It heavily advertised in the New York media market with the catchy jingle, "Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge."[58]  Headliners, such as Bob Hope, Milton Berle, and Connie Francis, performed in the Crystal Room, Mount Airy's 2,000-seat theater. Comedian Mickey Freeman said, "The food was lousy, but it was a legalized orgy."   The 1,200 acres (490 ha) resort's heyday was in the 1960s and 1970s before closing in 2001.[57]  In October 2007 the Mount Airy Casino Resort opened on the site.[56]

As of July 2015, there were three resorts in Monroe County with indoor water parks: Great Wolf Lodge, Aquatopia at Camelback Resort, and Kalahari Resort.[59]

Located in the vicinity of Big Pocono State Park, Blakeslee, and Long pond. The Glacial Till Barrens are best exeplified by the Long Pond Conservation Easement. Which has public access trail systems. Glacial Till Barrens are found in Dixon Miller State Forest,[36] and within the Bethlehem Authority property.   One of the only such ecosystems in the entire state of Pennsylvania. The Glacial till barrens are mesic (meaning moist), and yet have species that are more typical of far northern climates.[69][71]

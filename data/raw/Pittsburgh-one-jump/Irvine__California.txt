Irvine (/ˈɜːrvaɪn/ UR-vine) is a planned city in central Orange County, California, United States, in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. It was named in 1888 for the landowner James Irvine.[11] The Irvine Company started developing the area in the 1960s and the city was formally incorporated on December 28, 1971. The 66-square-mile (170 km2) city[12] had a population of 318,629 as of June 2025. As of 2025, it is the third most populous city in Orange County, fifth most in the Greater Los Angeles region, and 62nd most in the United States.

A number of corporations, particularly in the technology and semiconductor sectors, have their national or international headquarters in Irvine. Irvine is also home to several higher-education institutions including the University of California, Irvine (UCI), Concordia University, Irvine Valley College, and campuses of University of La Verne and Pepperdine University.

Gabrieleño indigenous group inhabited Irvine about 2,000 years ago.[13] In the present, the city and the schools within are taking action to educate the community about the indigenous history. In 2024 there was a proposal to create a village based off of Putuidem Village located in San Juan Capistrano.[14] UCI set a Land Acknowledgement to inform the history of the land their campus is based on as well as many other immigrant groups that had also lived on that land.[15]

Gaspar de Portolá, a Spanish explorer, came to the area in 1769, which led to the establishment of forts, missions and cattle herds. The King of Spain parceled out land for missions and private use.

After Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican Congress passed the Mexican secularization act of 1833 which secularized the missions and resulted in the Mexican government assuming control of the lands of said missions. It began distributing the land to Mexican citizens who applied for grants. Three large Spanish/Mexican land grants, also known as ranchos, made up the land that later became the Irvine Ranch: Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, Rancho San Joaquín and Rancho Lomas de Santiago.

In 1864, José Andrés Sepúlveda, owner of Rancho San Joaquín, sold 50,000 acres (200 km2) to Benjamin and Thomas Flint, Llewellyn Bixby, and James Irvine for $18,000 to resolve debts due to the Great Drought. In 1866, Irvine, Flint and Bixby acquired 47,000-acre (190 km2) Rancho Lomas de Santiago for $7,000. After the Mexican-American War the land of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana fell prey to tangled titles. In 1868, the ranch was divided among three claimants as part of a lawsuit: Flint, Bixby and Irvine. The ranches were devoted to sheep grazing. However, in 1870, tenant farming was permitted.

In 1878, James Irvine acquired his partners' interests for $150,000 ($4,887,414 in 2024 dollars[16]). His 110,000 acres (450 km2) stretched 23 miles (37 km) from the Pacific Ocean to the Santa Ana River. James Irvine died in 1886. The ranch was inherited by his son, James Irvine II, who incorporated it into the Irvine Company. James Irvine II shifted the ranch operations to field crops, olive and citrus crops.

In 1888, the Santa Fe Railroad extended its line to Fallbrook Junction, north of San Diego, and named a station along the way after James Irvine. The town that formed around this station was named Myford, after Irvine's son, because a post office in Calaveras County already bore the family name. The town was renamed Irvine in 1914.[17]

By 1918, 60,000 acres (240 km2) of lima beans were grown on the Irvine Ranch. Two Marine Corps facilities, MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin, were built during World War II on ranch land sold to the government.

James Irvine II died in 1947 at the age of 80. His son, Myford, assumed the presidency of the Irvine Company. He began opening small sections of the Irvine Ranch to urban development.

The Irvine Ranch played host to the Boy Scouts of America's 1953 National Scout Jamboree. Jamboree Road, a major street which now stretches from Newport Beach to the city of Orange, was named in honor of this event. David Sills, then a young Boy Scout from Peoria, Illinois, was among the attendees at the 1953 Jamboree. Sills came back to Irvine as an adult and went on to serve four terms as the city's mayor.

Myford Irvine died in 1959. The same year, the University of California asked the Irvine Company for 1,000 acres (4 km2) for a new university campus. The Irvine Company sold the requested land for $1 and later the state purchased an additional 500 acres (2.0 km2).[18]

William Pereira, the university's consulting architect, and the Irvine Company planners drew up master plans for a city of 50,000 people surrounding the new university. The plan called for industrial, residential and recreational areas, commercial centers and greenbelts. The new community was to be named Irvine; the old agricultural town of Irvine, where the railroad station and post office were located, was renamed East Irvine.[17] The first phases of the villages of Turtle Rock, University Park, Westpark (then called Culverdale), El Camino Real, and Walnut were completed by 1970.

On December 28, 1971, the residents of these communities voted to incorporate a substantially larger city than the one envisioned by the Pereira plan. By January 1999, Irvine had a population of 134,000 and a total area of 43 square miles (111 km2).[12]

In late 2003, after a ten-year-long legal battle, Irvine annexed the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. This added 7.3 square miles (19 km2) of land to the city and blocked an initiative championed by Newport Beach residents to replace John Wayne Airport with a new airport at El Toro.[19]  The Orange County Great Park was developed there.

Irvine borders Tustin to the north, Santa Ana to the northwest, Lake Forest to the east and southeast, Laguna Hills and Laguna Woods to the south, Costa Mesa to the west, and Newport Beach to the southwest. Irvine also shares a small border with Orange to the north on open lands by the SR 261.

San Diego Creek, which flows northwest into Upper Newport Bay, is the primary watercourse draining the city. Its largest tributary is Peters Canyon Wash. Most of Irvine is in a broad, flat valley between Loma Ridge in the north and San Joaquin Hills in the south. In the extreme northern and southern areas, however, are several hills, plateaus and canyons.

Los Angeles architect William Pereira and Irvine Company employee Raymond Watson designed Irvine's layout beginning in the late 1950s, which is nominally divided into townships called "villages", separated by six-lane arterial roads. Each township contains houses of similar design, along with commercial centers, religious institutions, and schools. Commercial districts are checker-boarded in a periphery around the central townships. Only automobile transportation was planned for, with other forms of transportation ignored, resulting in Irvine becoming extremely car dependent today.

Pereira originally envisioned the university campus at the northern end of the Irvine Ranch. When the Irvine Company refused to relinquish valuable farmland in the flat central region of the ranch for this plan, the university site was moved to the base of the southern coastal hills. The city layout was based on the shape of a necklace (with the villages strung along two parallel main streets, which terminate at University of California, Irvine (UCI), the "pendant").[20] Residential areas are now bordered by two commercial districts, the Irvine Business Complex to the west (part of the South Coast Plaza–John Wayne Airport edge city) and Irvine Spectrum to the east.

All streets have landscaping allowances. Rights-of-way for powerlines also serve as bicycle corridors, parks, and greenbelts to tie together ecological preserves. The city irrigates the greenery with reclaimed water.
The homeowners' associations which govern some village neighborhoods exercise varying degrees of control on the appearances of homes. In more restrictive areas, houses' roofing, paint colors, and landscaping are regulated. Older parts of the Village of Northwood that were developed beginning in the early 1970s independently of the Irvine Company and does not have homeowners' associations.The more tightly regulated villages generally offer more amenities, such as members-only swimming pools, tennis courts and parks.

Homeowners in villages developed in the 1980s and later may be levied a Mello-Roos special tax, which came about in the post-Proposition 13 era.

Each of the villages was initially planned to have a distinct architectural theme.

Business and commercial areas

Late spring and early summer in Irvine is subject to the June Gloom phenomenon widespread in southern California, with overcast mornings and occasional drizzle.
Late summer and autumn are warm and mostly dry, with occasional bouts of humid weather extending from Pacific hurricanes off the west coast of Mexico.
Winters are mild, with most winters having no frost, and can be hot and dry when the Santa Ana winds blow. Irvine has a Mediterranean climate wherein precipitation occurs predominantly during the winter months. Because Irvine is close to the coast, different parts of Irvine have different microclimates; for instance, the June Gloom effect is stronger in the southern parts of Irvine, closer to the Pacific Ocean.

It can occasionally snow in the Santa Ana Mountains to the northeast of Irvine.[23] Snow within the lower-lying parts of Irvine is very rare, but the area received three inches of snow in January 1949.[24] A tornado touched down in Irvine in 1991, an event that happens in Orange County more generally approximately once every five years.[25]

Irvine's tourism information is coordinated through the Destination Irvine program run by the City of Irvine. The program provides information on Irvine as a place to vacation and as a destination for meetings, events and other business initiatives. Irvine has been rated one of the top cities for start-up businesses and its strong, fast-growing economy helped place Orange County as one of the top ten fastest growing job markets.[60]

Irvine is also used as a location for film projects. The city government grants free or low-cost filming permits and offers location information to prospective productions.

Commercial and general aviation services are available at John Wayne Airport, located adjacent to the western border of Irvine.
Streets and intersections owned by the city have trademark mahogany signage and are fiber optically linked to the city's Irvine Traffic Research and Control Center (ITRAC).[96] Traffic cameras and ground sensors monitor the flow of traffic throughout the city and automatically adjust signal timing to line up traffic, allowing more vehicles to avoid red lights.[97]  Several major highways pass through Irvine (Interstate 5, and Interstate 405, California State Route 73, California State Route 133, California State Route 241, and California State Route 261).  Major arteries through Irvine are built out widely and run in a northeasterly direction with speed limits of 50 mph (80 km/h) or greater.

The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) operates 18 bus routes servicing 396 stops in Irvine.[99]

Additionally, OCTA operates and manages iShuttle, a series of three specialty routes servicing the Irvine area. Two lines, Route 400A and Route 401B, connect the Tustin Metrolink Station to the Irvine Business Complex area. Route 400A provides service between the Tustin Metrolink Station and John Wayne Airport with stops along Von Karman Avenue. Route 401B heads along Jamboree Road before continuing through Main Street and Michelson Drive. The remaining line, Route 403D, offer connections between the Irvine Station and the Irvine Spectrum Area, which includes major employers such as Kaiser Permanente – Irvine Medical Center, and Hoag Hospital Irvine, the Irvine Spectrum Center, and residential communities The Park and The Village.[100]

The city launched its own shuttle service, Irvine CONNECT, in April 2024. The route passes through Northwood and El Camino Real via Yale Avenue, then Woodbridge, Oak Creek, and the Irvine Spectrum area via Barranca Parkway and Alton Parkway, before terminating at Irvine Station. Shuttles arrive at roughly 20-minute intervals.[101][102] The city plans to expand service north to Portola Parkway beginning in July 2025.[103]

Irvine Station, also referred to as Irvine Transportation Center, is served by Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner train as well as Metrolink's Orange County Line and Inland Empire-Orange County Line.[104] Metrolink and Pacific Surfliner Monthly Pass holders may use both Metrolink and Amtrak services at this station through the Rail 2 Rail program.[105]

Tustin Metrolink Station, located adjacent to Irvine's western boundary, is served only by Metrolink.

In 2003, the City of Irvine designated a site 1.5 miles from Irvine Station as the future location of the Orange County Maintenance Facility (OCMF), a storage and service facility for Metrolink trains. An environmental study for the project was finalized in June 2022 and a Notice of Determination was filed by OCTA in October 2023.[106][107]

A major contributing factor to the growth of Irvine was by freight rail provided by ATSF (now BNSF) Transportation. The Venta Spur was Irvine's first spur. Built in the 1920s, it moved citrus from three processing plants in what is now Northwood to the rest of the country. The processing plants were essentially Irvine's first and biggest employers of the time.

The plants started to go out of business in the 1970s and the spur was abandoned in 1985. In 1999, following its donation to the city of Irvine, it was turned into the Venta Spur bike trail.

The Irvine Industrial Spur is the second railroad spur in Irvine. It serves various industries in Irvine's Business Complex.

Irvine offers a system of bicycle lanes and trails to encourage the recreational use of bikes as a means of transportation. There are 113.2 miles (182.2 km) of off-road bicycle trails and 286.4 miles (461 km) of on-road bicycle lanes in Irvine.[108]

Irvine contracts with the Orange County Fire Authority for fire protection and ambulance service is provided by private companies. Law enforcement is provided by the Irvine Police Department (IPD). The IPD operates in a suburban city rated as having one of the lowest violent crime rates among cities with over 100,000 inhabitants by the FBI every year since 2005.[109] The University of California Police Department also has jurisdiction – including arrest power – in areas of the city near the UC Irvine campus, while the California State University Police Department has similar jurisdiction in areas of the city near the CSU Fullerton Irvine campus. Irvine Valley College also maintains its own on campus police department.

Irvine is served by several health care facilities:

Water in Irvine is supplied by the Irvine Ranch Water District, which sources its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, importing water from the State Water Project and the Colorado River Aqueduct. Local groundwater is pumped from an underground reservoir. Additional water comes from the Harding Canyon Dam watershed and the Santiago Creek Dam watershed.[110]

Irvine has four sister cities:[111]

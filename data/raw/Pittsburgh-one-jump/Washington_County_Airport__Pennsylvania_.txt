Washington County Airport (IATA: WSG, ICAO: KAFJ, FAA LID: AFJ) is three miles (5 km) southwest of Washington in South Franklin Township, Pennsylvania. It is owned and operated by Washington County and is in the Greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area.[1]

Most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, but Washington County Airport is AFJ to the FAA and WSG to the IATA.

At one time, it hosted memorials for DeLloyd Thompson, a famous early pilot from Washington County, but those memorials had been discarded.[2] In 2013 and 2014, Clay Kilgore, executive director of the Washington County Historical Society, led an effort to restore the plaques to the airport.[3]

The airport covers 365 acres (1.48 km2) and has 37 T-hangars, seven corporate hangars and seven businesses that employ about thirty people. The airport is a relief airport for other airports such as Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport.

Hampton Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 18,470 at the 2020 census.[1] It is a suburb of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

The first settlers of present-day Hampton Township in northern Allegheny County arrived in the mid- to late 18th century around the time of the Revolutionary War. The town was called Tally Cavey. Hunters and fur trappers moved north of the Allegheny River in search of better game in the forests and more animals to capture and trade fur. In 1794, John McCaslin obtained a large section of land presently known as Oak Hill Farms near the junction of Route 8 and Mt. Royal Boulevard. Many geographical landmarks in the area bear the names of early settlers such as Robert and James Sample, William and Henry McCully, and John McNeal.[2]

In 1861, Moses Hampton, LLD, a judge and member of Congress, signed the documents necessary to make Hampton into a municipality comprising parts of McCandless, Indiana, and West Deer townships. Throughout the late 19th to the 20th century, people slowly began to move into this area, eventually creating a bustling community of over 18,000 people.[2]

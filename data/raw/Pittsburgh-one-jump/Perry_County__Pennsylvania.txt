Perry County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 45,842.[2] The county seat is New Bloomfield.[3] The county was created on March 22, 1820, and was named for Oliver Hazard Perry, a hero of the War of 1812, who had recently died.[4] It was originally part of Cumberland County and was created in part because residents did not want to travel over the mountain to Carlisle, the county seat of Cumberland County. Landisburg became the temporary county seat before New Bloomfield was ultimately chosen. The county is part of the South Central Pennsylvania region of the state.[a] Perry County is included in the Harrisburg–York–Lebanon combined statistical area. The county is served by the 717/223 area codes.

In 2010, the center of population of Pennsylvania was located in the eastern end of Perry County.[5] Green Park, an unincorporated village located in northeastern Tyrone Township, serves as Perry County's midpoint between the Conococheague Mountain in the west and the Susquehanna River to the east.[6]

The county terrain is formed by the folded Appalachian Mountain ridges which run from southwest to northeast across the county. The terrain slopes to the northeast,[7] with its highest point on the Blue Mountain Ridge, which delineates the border between Perry and Cumberland counties. The ridge peaks at 0.83 miles (1.34 km) NE from Perry County's southmost corner; it measures 2,269 ft (692 m) ASL.[8] Perry County is one of the 423 counties served by the Appalachian Regional Commission,[9] and it is identified as part of the "Midlands" by Colin Woodard in his book American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America.[10]

The county is drained by the south-flowing Susquehanna River, which forms almost all of its eastern boundary. The Juniata River enters Perry County from Juniata County near Millerstown, and flows southeast to its confluence with the Susquehanna River near Duncannon. The county also contains several creeks, runs, and lakes,[11] which provide recreational and fishing[12] opportunities, formerly powered mills throughout the county[13] and provided transport venues. To this day, canoeing and kayaking are forms of recreation which utilize the Shermans Creek and other waters in the county.[14]

The county has a total area of 556 square miles (1,440 km2), of which 551 square miles (1,430 km2) is land and 4.1 square miles (11 km2) (0.7%) is water.[15] The Appalachian Trail runs through the town of Duncannon. The county is also famous for being the northern head of the Tuscarora Trail.

[2] The hardiness zone is 6b except in Marysville where it is 7a ( [3]). Common trees include red maple,[16] Virginia pine, oak, eastern white pine,[17] eastern hemlock,[18] birch, shagbark hickory,[19] and juniper, though American sycamore, ironwood (ex: Hop-hornbeam, American Hornbeam), sugar maple, black walnut, elm, alder, black cherry, black locust, and sassafras are also fairly common.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Mosses of various species are common sights, especially on fallen tree logs, along streams, on tree trunks,[26] and in sidewalk cracks, usually growing in shaded areas. Ferns also grow along streams and in shaded areas, and are also commonly seen in Perry County woodlands.

Perry County's economy is primarily agricultural.[49] Various farmers markets,[50] roadside stands, farm produce stands,[51] food festivals,[52] resale farm stands, meat stores, and plant nurseries[53][54] are present throughout the county. Two farms in Perry County are particularly well known, which are Spiral Path Farm and Yeehaw Farm, with the latter having been spotlighted by the Washington Post.[55] The county's area is 38.3% farmland, of which 11.09% (thus 4.24% of all land in the county) is pastureland.[56]

Perry County also hosts a wide range of non-agricultural businesses. Historically, mills were prevalent, and the county currently has 21 known non-operational mills still standing.[57] Settlement was not allowed until 1755, and when settlement was allowed, it was not safe: in June 1755, Native Americans chased nearly all of the pioneers out, until it was considered safe to return in 1762. The first mill was taxed in 1763, though the exact date of its completion is not known.[58]

Nearly every stream's basin hosted a sawmill, providing wood for early buildings and boardwalks.[58]

The county has a variety of recreation facilities. There are three state parks: Fowlers Hollow State Park, Little Buffalo State Park, and Big Spring State Forest Picnic Area. The Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area is found near New Bloomfield along Huckleberry Road. Carroll Township Park also offers a wide variety of athletic facilities.[59]

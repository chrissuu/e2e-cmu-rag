Greene County is a county in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the 2020 census, the population was 35,954.[1] Its county seat is Waynesburg.[2] Greene County was created on February 9, 1796, from part of Washington County and named for General Nathanael Greene.  Greene County is part of the Pittsburgh media market. It is in the area of southwestern Pennsylvania that was claimed by Virginia, the District of West Augusta. The county is part of the Southwest region of the commonwealth.[a]

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 578 square miles (1,500 km2), of which 576 square miles (1,490 km2) is land and 2.0 square miles (5.2 km2) (0.4%) is water.[3] It has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) and average monthly temperatures in Waynesburg range from 28.9 °F in January to 71.9 °F in July.[4] Greene County is one of the 423 counties served by the Appalachian Regional Commission,[5] and it is identified as part of "Greater Appalachia" by Colin Woodard in his book American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America.[6] It is also located within the Laurel Highlands subrange, which consists of low plateaus and river valleys.

As of the census[8] of 2010, there were 38,686 people, 14,724 households, and 9,970 families residing in the county. The population density was 67 people per square mile (26 people/km2). There were 16,678 housing units at an average density of 29 units per square mile (11/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 94.6 percent White, 3.3 percent Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.3 percent Asian, 0.0 percent Pacific Islander, 0.7 percent from other races, and 1.0% from two or more races. 1.2 percent of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Greene County was long a Democratic stronghold, due to the strong unionization of the county's steel mills; between 1932 and 2000, the Democratic presidential candidate won the county in every election except in the Republican landslide of 1972. Due to the decline of the Pittsburgh area's steel industry (similar to other Appalachian counties), and the Democratic Party's shift on cultural issues like environmental safety and firearms, the county has shifted towards the Republican Party, and in 2016 Donald Trump won the county with 68.4% of the vote.

As of February 8, 2025, there are 21,629 registered voters in the county. There are 11,762 registered Republicans, 7,727 registered Democrats, 1,542 voters registered non-affiliated voters, and 598 voters registered to other parties.[12]

Greene County is administered by a three-person board of commissioners, who serve four-year terms. Elections occur in the odd-numbered years that precede U.S. presidential elections, with the most recent election falling in 2023. All three commissioners are chosen in the same election, and voters may vote for no more than two of the candidates. The commissioners are responsible for the management of the fiscal and administrative functions of the county.[13]

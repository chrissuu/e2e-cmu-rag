Lower Paxton is a township in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 53,514 at the 2020 census.[2] It is the most populous municipality in Dauphin County and the 17th-most populated municipality in the state.[3]

Lower Paxton Township is located 76.6 miles (123.3 km) southwest of Allentown, 9.4 miles (15.1 km) northeast of Harrisburg, and 107.3 miles (172.7 km) northwest of Philadelphia.

The township was incorporated in 1767 from Paxton Township.

In 1729, the Paxtang Township was established within Lancaster County. The spelling "Paxtang" is from the original American Indian name Peshtank, which meant "standing water".[4] Today the word "Paxton" is used instead of Paxtang.

On March 4, 1785, the boundaries of Paxtang Township also became the borders of Dauphin County, split from Lancaster County. "Dauphin" refers to the Dauphin of France, heir apparent to the French throne, whose country the area government wanted to honor for its assistance in the Revolutionary War. About two years later in August 1787 the legislature began to splinter Paxtang Township, first into Upper Paxtang, Middle Paxtang, and Lower Paxtang.[5]

In the years after Dauphin County was established, the township was slowly divided. Hanover Township was cut off to the east in 1736, and Upper Paxton Township was cut off to the north in 1767. What remained in 1767 was then renamed Lower Paxton Township. The divisions continued. Harrisburg Borough, now the city of Harrisburg, was formed in 1791, and Swatara Township was created in 1799. In 1878, more land was cut off the north and became Middle Paxton Township.

Lower Paxtang Township embraced the areas now occupied by Lower Swatara, Swatara, Lower Paxton, Derry, and Susquehanna townships. Lower Paxton has remained the same area since Susquehanna Township was formed from it on May 1, 1815.

Lower Paxton Township is located in south-central Dauphin County, bordered by Susquehanna Township to the west, Middle Paxton Township to the north, West Hanover and South Hanover townships to the east, and Swatara Township to the south.

Bayernhof Music Museum features a major collection of automated musical instruments from the 19th and 20th centuries.[1]  Located six miles (10 km) northeast of downtown Pittsburgh in the suburb of O'Hara Township, Pennsylvania, it is housed in a German-style mansion sited on an 18-acre (73,000 m2) dramatic overlook some 540 feet (160 m) above the Allegheny River Valley.

Bayernhof is the name of the mansion itself, a $4.2 million project completed in 1982 as a private residence by Charles Brown III (1935–1999), founder and CEO of Gas-Lite Manufacturing Company in Pittsburgh. The 19,000-square-foot (1,800 m2) house includes a rooftop observatory, an indoor cave, a swimming pool with a 10-foot (3.0 m) waterfall, ten fireplaces, eight full baths, three powder rooms, three full-size kitchens as well as a completely restored copper still.

The museum was a directive of Mr. Brown's will, and it opened to the public in 2004.

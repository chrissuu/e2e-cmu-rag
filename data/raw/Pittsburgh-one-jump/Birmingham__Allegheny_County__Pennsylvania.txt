Birmingham was a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, on the South Side of what is now Pittsburgh. Incorporated in 1826 from St. Clair Township,[1]  the borough comprised a section of the South Side Flats between what is now South 6th and South 17th Streets.

Birmingham was laid out in 1811 by Dr. Nathaniel Bedford, son-in-law of John Ormsby. Bedford named the settlement after his native city, Birmingham in England.[2]

Birmingham became flanked by the boroughs of South Pittsburgh (created 1848) on the west and East Birmingham (1849) on the east.[3] Those three and other nearby boroughs were merged into Pittsburgh in 1872.[1]

The namesake Birmingham Bridge is actually located at the former East Birmingham.

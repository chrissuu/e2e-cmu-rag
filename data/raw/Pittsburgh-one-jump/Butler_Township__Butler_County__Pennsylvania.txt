Butler Township is a township in Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 17,230 at the 2020 census.[2] The township was first settled by Europeans in 1795. It was established as a township in 1804 and as a first class township in 1922.[3]

In 1795 William Kearns was an early settler of the township. He was originally from Ireland and owned around 1,000 acres of land in both Butler township and Summit township. A revolutionary war soldier by the name of Thomas McKee also owned land in Butler township at the same time. Butler Township was incorporated in 1804 when Butler County was divided into 13 different townships, granted at this time Butler township was split into North and South Butler until 1854 when it gained its current day boundaries.[4]

On July 13, 2024, the attempted assassination of Donald Trump took place in Butler Township,[5] in the Butler Farm Show Grounds. At the event, Butler Township police primarily did traffic duties. The majority of the venue is in adjacent Connoquenessing Township, and that township uses the Pennsylvania State Police as its local law enforcement. Therefore the state police agency filled several law enforcement duties during the event instead of the Butler Township police.[6]

Butler Township is located near the center of Butler County and surrounds the city of Butler, the county seat. The township contains the unincorporated communities of Homeacre-Lyndora, Meridian, Meadowood, and Oak Hills, all of which are census-designated places. The unincorporated town of Lyndora, which has its own post office (zip code 16045), is located within Butler Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 21.7 square miles (56.3 km2), of which 21.6 square miles (56.0 km2) is land and 0.12 square miles (0.3 km2), or 0.58%, is water.[7]

Connoquenessing Creek, a tributary of the Beaver River, flows to the southwest out of Butler city and crosses the southern part of the township. In 2000, a scientific study was conducted to determine the health of the creek. Researchers discovered that only the Mississippi River received more toxic materials than the Connoquenessing, making the small river the second most polluted waterway in the United States. At the time, the Armco Inc. steel facility in Butler ranked first nationally for the amount of pollutant discharges.[8] However, by 2010, due to reduced industry and clean up efforts, the creek's health has significantly recovered and has become popular for water-sport activities.[9]

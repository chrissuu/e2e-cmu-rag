Oakmont Country Club is a country club in Plum and Oakmont, Pennsylvania, United States. Established in 1903, the club predominantly lies in the borough of Plum, in the East Hills suburbs of Pittsburgh. Its golf course is regarded as the "oldest top-ranked golf course in the United States" and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.[5] The Pennsylvania Turnpike separates seven holes (two through eight) from the rest of the layout. Oakmont most recently hosted its record tenth U.S. Open in 2025.

The course, the only design by Henry Fownes, opened in 1903. With a crew of 150 men and under two dozen mule teams, Henry Fownes spent a year building Oakmont on old farmland, ideal for a links-style course.

The course straddles the Allegheny River Valley and uniquely has virtually no water hazards and, since 2007, almost no trees. With a USGA course rating of 77.5[2] and 168 bunkers, it is generally regarded in the golf community as one of the most difficult in the United States.[6][7] It features large, extremely fast, and undulating greens, while the rough is tough and thick.[8] All of the greens are original save for the eighth, which was moved several yards to the left to make way for the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the late 1940s. Originally a links course, trees were added in the 1950s-1960s. Most were removed beginning after the 1994 U.S. Open, with between 5,000 and 8,000 eliminated during a 2007 renovation alone.[9][10] Greens are planted with Poa annua,[10][11] and par for members is 71.

The course is also noted for its slope. In particular, on holes one, three, 10, and 12, the greens pitch away from the fairway.[12]

One of Oakmont's most famous hazards is the Church Pews bunker that comes into play on the third and fourth holes. The bunker measures approximately 100 by 40 yards (91 by 37 m) and features 13 grass-covered traversing ridges that resemble church pews.[10][13]

For many years, Oakmont's bunkers were groomed with a rake with wider than normal tines, creating deep furrows. The rakes were last used in U.S. Open competition in 1962 and eliminated from the club in 1964.[14]

The course has been consistently ranked as one of the five best by Golf Digest 100 Greatest Golf Courses in America. In 2007, Oakmont was placed in fifth by the magazine.[15] It is one of only a few courses ranked in the top 10 every year of the publication's history. The top 50 toughest courses ranks Oakmont also at number five,[16] while GolfLink.com ranks it third overall.[17]

Oakmont has hosted the U.S. Open 10 times, more than any other course, most recently in 2025.[18] It has also hosted three PGA Championships, six U.S. Amateurs, two U.S. Women's Opens, and three NCAA men's championships (1916, 1930, 1937).

The first U.S. Open at Oakmont was won by Tommy Armour, who defeated Harry Cooper in an 18-hole Friday playoff.  Their 72-hole score was 301 (+13); the par-72 course played to 6,929 yards (6,336 m) in 1927 (the first and ninth holes were both par 5).[19] The average score for the field was 78.6 (+ 6.6) and the field recorded just 2 rounds under par. The total purse of prize money was $800 ($14,481 in 2024 dollars).[20]

Won by Sam Parks Jr. at 11 strokes over par. The par 72 course played to 6,981 yards (6,383 m) in 1935 and the average score for the field was 80.55 (+ 8.55) and the field recorded 3 rounds under par. The total purse of prize money was $5,000 ($114,672 in 2024 dollars) with a winner's share of $1,000 ($22,934 in 2024 dollars).

Ben Hogan won the second of his three straight majors in 1953 at Oakmont by six strokes, coming in at five under par.

Scheduling conflicts made it impossible to win all four majors that year, as the late rounds of the PGA Championship, then a match play event, and the mandatory 36-hole qualifier directly preceding the British Open overlapped in early July. Hogan won The Masters by five strokes and the British Open at Carnoustie by four strokes. The par-72 Oakmont course played at 6,916 yards (6,324 m) in 1953, and the average score for the field was 77.12 (+ 5.12); the field recorded 20 rounds under par. The purse was $14,900 and the champion earned $5,000 ($175,112 and $58,762 in 2024 dollars).

At the 1962 U.S. Open, an up-and-coming 22-year-old named Jack Nicklaus defeated the world's top player at the time, the 33-year-old Arnold Palmer, in a Sunday playoff round in Palmer's "backyard".

Both competitors had completed the 72 holes with a 283 (–1). It was the first professional victory for Nicklaus, and the first of his 18 professional majors.  Palmer won the next major, the 1962 British Open, and his fourth Masters in 1964, but never another U.S. Open.  In 1962, par was reduced by a stroke to 71 (the first hole became a par-4) and the course length was slightly reduced to 6,893 yards (6,303 m); the average score for the field was 75.86 (+ 4.86) and the field recorded 19 rounds under par.  The purse was $81,600 and the champion earned $17,500 ($848,227 and $181,911 in 2024 dollars).[citation needed]

Johnny Miller shot a final round 63 (–8) to set a record low score at a U.S. Open, and finished at 279 (–5) to win by one stroke in 1973.[21]

Following an overnight rainstorm, Miller entered the final round in 12th place at three-over, six strokes behind the four co-leaders.[22] Miller had carded a disappointing five-over 76 on Saturday, and his tee time on Sunday was about an hour ahead of the final pairing, which included Arnold Palmer.

Miller birdied the first four holes and hit all 18 greens in regulation, and used only 29 putts.  Miller and four others were the only ones to break par during the final round in 1973.  The par 71 course played at 6,921 yards (6,329 m) and the average score for the field was 75.45 (+ 4.45) and the field recorded 40 rounds under par. The purse was $219,400 and the champion earned $35,000 ($1.55 million and $247,912 in 2024 dollars).

Miller's low score (9 birdies with 1 bogey) led the USGA to set up the course at the following year's championship, now known as The Massacre at Winged Foot, in an extremely challenging manner; Hale Irwin's winning score in 1974 was seven strokes over par.

In 1983, Larry Nelson was at 148 (+6) after the first two rounds.  He then established the 36-hole record at the U.S. Open when he finished 65–67 to finish at 280 (–4), one stroke ahead of runner-up and defending champion Tom Watson. Nelson's two-round total of 132 (–10) broke the 51-year-old record by four shots, established by Gene Sarazen in 1932. Nelson's record, although not receiving level acclaim to Miller's 63 finish, stood until 2011 when Rory McIlroy broke it. The par 71 course played at 6,972 yards (6,375 m) in 1983, and the average score for the field was 76.13 (+ 5.13), and the field recorded 27 rounds under par. The purse was $506,184 and the champion earned $72,000 ($1.6 million and $227,306 in 2024 dollars).

In 1994, a 24-year-old Ernie Els outlasted Loren Roberts and Colin Montgomerie in another Monday playoff round to capture the U.S. Open, his first major and first victory in the U.S. It was the first three-way playoff at the U.S. Open since 1963.

The three in the playoff completed the four rounds at 279 (–5), but all were well over par early in the playoff round, played in oppressive heat and humidity, as temperatures approached 100 °F (38 °C).[24] Montgomerie shot a 42 on the front nine, ending at 78 (+7) and was eliminated. However, Els and Roberts were tied at 3-over 74, with Roberts missing a short putt on the 18th hole to win outright, so they kept playing as a sudden-death playoff.  On the second extra hole, Roberts bogeyed, and Els made par to win the championship.  The par 71 course played at 6,946 yards (6,351 m) in 1994, and the average score for the field was 74.25 (+ 3.25); the field recorded 62 rounds under par. The purse was $1.75 million and the champion earned $320,000 ($3.71 million and $678,868 in 2024 dollars).

Ángel Cabrera of Argentina shot 285 (+5) in 2007, one stroke ahead of runners-up Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk.

A course renovation had deepened the bunkers and removed over 4,000 trees that had been planted mostly in the 1960s, returning the course to its original links-style appearance.[25]  The course was lengthened to 7,230 yards (6,611 m) and par was reduced by a stroke to 70, as the uphill 9th hole became a par-4.  The par-3 8th hole played at 300 yards (274 m) in Round 4, the par-5 12th hole at over 660 yards (604 m), and the par-4 15th at 500 yards (457 m).  The average score for the field in 2007 was 75.72 (+ 5.72), with every hole averaging an over-par score.[26] The field recorded just 8 rounds under par, only two per round.  Cabrera had two of these sub-par rounds, shooting a 69 (-1) on Thursday and Sunday.

The weather was much more agreeable than in 1994: the high temperatures were 75–80 °F (24–27 °C) for the first three rounds and 90 °F (32 °C) for the final round, and there were no weather delays in any of the rounds.  The total purse was $7.0 million and the champion earned $1.26 million ($10.6 million and $1.91 million in 2024 dollars).

The club hosted the U.S. Open for a record ninth time in 2016, and Dustin Johnson shot 276 (–4) to win his first major title by three strokes.

The club hosted the U.S. Open for a tenth time in 2025, and J. J. Spaun shot 279 (–1) to win his first major title by two strokes.

Oakmont is scheduled to host its eleventh U.S. Open in 2033.

Oakmont is scheduled to host its twelfth U.S. Open in 2042.

On Oakmont's greens:

The stimpmeter, a device for measuring the speed of greens, was developed by Edward Stimpson (1904–1985), an accomplished amateur player from Massachusetts, shortly after attending the 1935 U.S. Open at Oakmont.[30][31][32][33]

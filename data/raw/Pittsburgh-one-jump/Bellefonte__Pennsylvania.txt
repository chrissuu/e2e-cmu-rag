Bellefonte is a borough in and the county seat of Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is approximately 12 miles northeast of State College and is part of the State College, Pennsylvania metropolitan statistical area. The borough population was 6,187 at the 2010 census.[5] It houses the Centre County Courthouse, located downtown on the diamond.  Bellefonte has also been home to five of Pennsylvania's governors, as well as two other governors.[6]  All seven are commemorated in a monument located at Talleyrand Park.

The town features many examples of Victorian architecture. It is also home to the natural spring, "la belle fonte", bestowed by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord during a land-speculation visit to central Pennsylvania in 1790, from which the town derives its name. The spring, which serves as the town's water supply, has since been  covered to comply with DEP water purity laws.

The early development of Bellefonte had been as a "natural town." It started with one house and a crossroad, then iron was found and the town grew.[7]

William Lamb sold his mill to John Dunlop in 1794. The following year, John’s father James Dunlop and John’s son-in-law James Harris (1756–1841) laid out the town that would become known as Bellefonte.

As the years went by, Bellefonte boomed and soon became the most influential town between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg.[8]

The Bellefonte Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Other buildings on the National Register of Historic Places are: Bellefonte Armory, Bellefonte Forge House, Brockerhoff Hotel, Centre County Courthouse, Gamble Mill, McAllister-Beaver House, Miles-Humes House, Pennsylvania Match Company, South Ward School, and the William Thomas House. Bellefonte Academy was listed until 2008; it was destroyed by fire in 2004.[9]

Bush House Hotel was built in 1868–69 by Bellefonte attorney and developer Daniel G. Bush. It was one of the first hotels in the country to have electric lights. A man would stand at the train station and call out to the passengers, "Walk ya' to the Bush House." The Brockerhoff House, the Haag House, and other area hotels were competitors.  Many notable guests stayed at the Bush House including Thomas Edison.[10]  The Bush House burned down on February 8, 2006.[11]

This building was designed by pioneering female architect Anna Wagner Keichline, a native of Bellefonte, and originally served as a car dealership with a showroom on first floor, a repair shop on the second, and an office and living space on the third floor. The Cadillac Building, so named because it was originally built as a Cadillac dealership in 1916, was a mix use commercial and residential property hit by a devastating fire on December 22, 2009. Christmas tree lights in one of the apartment units were determined to be the cause.

The Cadillac Building was rebuilt in 2016 and is now home to 11 two- and three-bedroom apartment units.  It remains a part of the Bellefonte Historic District.[12]

The Garman Opera House was originally built in 1890 and hosted many notable stars of the day, including George Burns and Gracie Allen, Western performer Tom Mix, and illusionist and escape artist Harry Houdini.

The song "After the Ball" was said to have been first sung in public here.  It was eventually also used as a movie theater, first showing silent films and then "talkies."  By the early 1960s, the property was converted to primarily commercial/warehouse use.  In the 1990s, the building was restored and returned to its roots as a live performance venue and cinema.

The opera house was severely damaged by a fire on September 9, 2012 that also destroyed the Garman House Hotel.  The cause of the fire has been ruled as arson.  Preservationist groups' attempts to save the Garman were unsuccessful and the building was razed in January 2014.

Garman House was rebuilt in 2016 and is now home to 21 one and two bedroom apartment units.

First-time visitors who walk along the Victorian streets of Bellefonte see primarily Victorian houses.  One of many examples is the Hastings Mansion, which was owned by Mrs. John Lane and was bought and remodeled by Governor Daniel H. Hastings.

In the 1800s, the first jail was built. It had a dungeon eight feet underground, which was located on the rear of the lot of the present YMCA. A second jail was on East High Street.

One of the town's historic sections experienced a renaissance in 2004. The Match Factory (officially the Pennsylvania Match Company), after standing vacant since 1947, was renovated by the American Philatelic Society as their new home, one building at a time. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

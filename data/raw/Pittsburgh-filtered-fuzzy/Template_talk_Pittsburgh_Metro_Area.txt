Considering that one regional navbox is fine and that the region recently grew to include countis in Ohio and West Virginia in the most followed metric (albeit as combined statistical areas), following the years and decades old claim by several federal agencies, local organizations and TV stations etc. I was considering changing the display title to remove any potential confusion between the MSA and CSA (all of which link to the same article).  Pittsburgh Tri-State would be my choice but wondered if Greater Pittsburgh or the Pittsburgh Region might be better choices.  Thanks for any suggestions.

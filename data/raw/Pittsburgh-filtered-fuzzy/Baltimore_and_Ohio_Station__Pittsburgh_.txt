B&O Railroad Depot was one of several railroad stations in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the late 19th and early 20th century. The station was built in 1887, 16 years after the B&O Railroad opened its first railroad line into Pittsburgh. The station was built next to the Monongahela River. B&O railroad trains also used the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station for services that continued westward towards Chicago via the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad. In 1955 the station was demolished to make room for an interstate highway and remaining services were transferred to Grant Street Station. The building was designed by Frank Furness who also constructed the B&O Railroad's Philadelphia station.[2]

At the time of its 1955 closing, major named long distance passenger trains making stops at the station included:

Additionally, the B&O operated a train from Pittsburgh to Buffalo via DuBois and East Salamanca.[3]

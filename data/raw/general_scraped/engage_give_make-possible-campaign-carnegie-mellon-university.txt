What is Make Possible?
The largest campaign in CMU history, Make Possible is a $2 billion comprehensive campaign that was publicly announced in October 2018 and ran through June 2025. Aimed at accelerating the institution’s leadership at the critical intersection of technology and humanity, it raised support around four key pillars that are advancing the university’s mission:
Accelerating technological advancements to benefit humanity
Fueling artistic expression and creative inquiry to shape modern culture
Achieving breakthroughs in discovery by transforming how scientific inquiry is pursued
Fostering a dynamic experience that enables CMU students to thrive throughout their lives.
The campaign hit its ambitious initial $2 billion goal 18 months early, and raised $2.5 billion in total.

Pittsburgh Opera to host 18 th Annual Piano Sale August 21st-24th
Pittsburgh Opera will be hosting its eagerly-anticipated annual piano sale at its headquarters the Bitz Opera Factory , at 2425 Liberty Ave. in the Strip District from Thursday, August 21 st through Sunday, August 24 th . Over 250 pianos will be available, across all price points.
Patrons wishing to attend the sale are encouraged to make an appointment by either calling 412-454-5555 or registering online at pittsburghoperapiano.com . Complimentary on-site parking is provided.
Every year, Pittsburgh Opera receives a free loan of new pianos from Solich Piano – Yamaha’s Dealer of the Year - for rehearsal, coaching, and performance needs. To support this ongoing loan program, these and other fine pianos are offered for sale after each season. All pianos are sold at institutional prices not normally available in retail stores.
In addition to the gently-used pianos which have been loaned to Pittsburgh Opera, the sale will include a wide range of brand-new Yamaha grands, uprights, digitals, hybrids, and Disklavier player pianos, as well as other used pianos being sold at significant discounts. Pianos include top-quality brands such as Yamaha, Bösendorfer, Schimmel, Baldwin, Estonia, vintage Steinway and others. All of the pianos - new and loaned - come with manufacturer warranties and technical services. Delivery and special financing is available, and trade-ins are welcome.
Anyone who comes to the sale can enter a drawing to win a free pair of season tickets to Pittsburgh Opera’s upcoming 2025-26 season’s productions of La Bohème , Fellow Travelers , and Falstaff .

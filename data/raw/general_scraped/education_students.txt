Download our Student Matinee Reservation Form. Adapted from Shakespeare plays, Falstaff is full of merriment and mischief! Beloved buffoon Sir John Falstaff has fallen on hard times. But being a ladies’ man (or so he’d like to think), he schemes to cash in on his wit and charm by wooing the wealthy wives of Windsor, Alice Ford and Meg Page. When they uncover that he has sent them both identical love letters, they hatch a plan of their own to teach Falstaff a lesson he won’t soon forget! Students will enjoy a complete mainstage performance of Verdi’s comedy with full orchestra, top-quality singers, and colorful production elements. Falstaff provides rich learning opportunities about music, history, and Shakespeare. Attend the prerequisite workshop to receive  extensive education materials, including a Study Guide, Lesson Ideas, PowerPoints, and an Arts Discovery Packet.

Welcome to ID Card Services
ID Card services help make you official.
One of the most important items you'll need at Carnegie Mellon is your official ID Card. This photo identification card classifies you as a member of the CMU community and will be part of your everyday campus life.
From bus access and Plaid Cash spending to campus events and museum entry, your ID Card is an essential tool for on and off campus.

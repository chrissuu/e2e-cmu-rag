As the longest running film festival in the region, Reel Q has been around for it all. We became festival-official in 1985, and shortly thereafter boasted of our “East Coast” premiere of My Own Private Idaho. In 2012, we changed our name from Pittsburgh Lesbian and Gay Film Society to Reel Q in an effort to be more inclusive of the full LGBTQIA+ community. Originally conceived as a local space to showcase independent queer cinema that wasn’t readily available to mainstream audiences, Reel Q has remained committed to that mission, but also upped the ante with the diversity of our programming, partners, and, of course, parties (in the pre and post pandemic times).
This October will mark our 38th annual Reel Q film festival , our landmark series of screenings, which is traditionally a 10 day celebration. As the sixth oldest running LGBTQ+ film festival in the world, we are proud of the longevity of the festival and the friendly audience we’ve accrued over the years. The festival is a whirl-windy blast, featuring meet-and-greets with cast members and directors, panel discussions, queer craft markets and, did we mention the parties? This year’s celebration is scheduled for Oct. 6-15, 2023.

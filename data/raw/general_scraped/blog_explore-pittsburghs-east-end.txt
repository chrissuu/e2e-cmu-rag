Next stop is Squirrel Hill (2 miles from Point Breeze), Pittsburgh's largest neighborhood, which centers around its main business district situated along Forbes and Murray Avenues. Home to a diverse array of casual eateries and small shops, take a walk and duck into some quaint little shops. Ten Thousand Villages features handmade gifts, jewelry, home decor, art and sculpture and more, representing the diverse cultures of artisans in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Grab some vintage clothing at Avalon Exchange . Indulge your sweet tooth at Gaby et Jules , a great (but expensive) French pastry shop. Or catch an afternoon flick at The Manor , a quaint old movie house showing blockbuster movies and indie films. Read our blog all about Squirrel Hill for more ideas of what to do in this neighborhood.

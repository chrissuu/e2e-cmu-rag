In our everyday lives, we use a counting system in which we count from 1 to 10. That seems only logical because our hands are already in what is called base 10, which means the number 10 serves as the base of our number system . Each place in a number corresponds to a different power of 10 . For example, 285,553 = (2 × 100,000) + (8 × 10,000) + (5 × 1,000) + (5 × 100) + (5 × 10) + 3. (The final 3 can be considered as 3 × 10 0 , where the zeroth power of 10 is 1.)
However, although base 10 seems logical, that doesn’t mean that it has been universally used. The ancient Babylonians used a base-60 system, which they inherited from the Sumerians . No one knows why they used such a base. It has been speculated that 60 has the mathematically pleasing property of being the smallest number divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, though if a lot of divisible numbers are wanted, a base 12 gets you 1 through 4 and 6 but with a much-less-unwieldy system.
With base 10 being a counting system based on fingers, if you bring in the toes, then you can have a base-20 system. Base 20 shows up in French, where 80 is “quatre-vingts,” or “four twenties.” In Danish, 50 is “halvtreds,” or “two and a half times twenty.” Once all the fingers and toes have been used, the body seems finished as the basis of a counting system, but the Oksapmin people of Papua New Guinea have a base-27 body-derived system. The fingers are 1 through 5, and then counting goes up the arm, with the wrist 6, mid-forearm 7, up the arm to the neck at 11, an ear at 12, an eye at 13, the nose at 14, and back down the other side of the head, neck, and arm to the fingers on the other hand being 23 through 27.
Vestiges of other counting systems survive too. The Babylonian base 60 appears in the number of minutes in an hour and seconds in a minute. Base 12 appears in measurement; 12 inches in a foot , 12 months in a year, etc. Base 20 gives the Gettysburg Address some of its rhetorical power, with “Four score and seven years ago” sounding more inspiring than the base-10 “Eighty-seven years ago.”

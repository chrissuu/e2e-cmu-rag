Take inspiration from the stories depicted in The Scandinavian Home: Landscape and Lore, from princesses and heroic Vikings to trolls and evil stepmothers, to create your own work of art.
Participants will learn basic slab rolling and coiling techniques to build their design using air-dry clay. Homes will be decorated during the workshop with acrylic paint and mixed media materials. Everyone who participates is automatically entered into the Gnome Home competition on display in the Grable Visitor Center through Sunday, November 23. The winner of the competition will receive a Frick gift basket.
This workshop is best suited for participants ages 9 and up. Anyone below the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult.
Registration includes Scandinavian-inspired snacks, refreshments, and all the materials you need to create your own gnome home!

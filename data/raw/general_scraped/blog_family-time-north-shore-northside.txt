Are there things to do in Pittsburgh that aren’t in the North Shore and Northside neighborhoods? You bet! Recently, my daughter spent her 31st birthday at Kennywood . She first visited the park as a four-year-old. Kennywood is a small amusement park with top-rated rollercoasters, a 100-year-old carousel, iconic concessions and kiddie rides. It also features gardens, greenery, shade and benches to soak in the atmosphere. Don’t pass on The Potato Patch fries!
Kennywood, celebrating its 125th anniversary in 2023, is located about 12 miles southeast of Downtown Pittsburgh. It has ample parking and reasonably priced admission. Stay the afternoon and into the evening to marvel at the lights.

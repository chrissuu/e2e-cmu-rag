Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs
What is Welcoming Pittsburgh?
The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA) within the Mayor's Office was established in January 2022, to build on the work started by the Welcoming Pittsburgh Initiative in 2014. This initiative was guided by the Welcoming Pittsburgh Roadmap , 37 recommendations and emerging priorities identified by 40 leaders from diverse sectors and over 3,000 community members.
OIRA has continued to work towards its historical goals and objectives related to making Pittsburgh a city that is committed to the inclusion of its immigrant populations.

With the boom the soccer scene has seen in Pittsburgh, Highmark Stadium will be undergoing an expansion in order to meet U.S. Soccer’s Pro League Standards requiring a capacity of 15,000 for Division One sanctioning. The expansion to the home of the Riverhounds and the Riveters will feature more premium seating areas, a club with banquet space, and suites, providing a range of options for fans. These upgrades will allow the South Shore stadium to host additional sports and entertainment events, including concerts, and better serve the region. That means more seats, more events, and more fun for the whole family!
Since 2023, the Riverhounds have sold out 73% of their home matches and in each of the last two years, the Riverhounds’ average attendance has exceeded capacity with fans using standing room only opportunities to attend matches.
In their first season, the Riveters hosted 28,138 fans for six games. Their inaugural match brought in over 6,000 people, the fourth-largest soccer crowd in the stadium’s history.
When completed, the stadium is expected to attract almost 500,000 people in annual attendance.
Highmark Stadium has already been selected to host the 2027 NCAA Division III Soccer Championships.

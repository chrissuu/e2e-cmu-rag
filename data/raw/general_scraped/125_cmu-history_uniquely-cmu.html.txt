Building the Tartan legacy one moment at a time
What is a Tartan? They are fearless innovators, restless problem-solvers, human-focused thinkers, and unique creators who make a difference in their fields, in their communities, around the world and — at times — the cosmos. They have each contributed to a legacy of achievement and impact that is “so CMU.”
Building a Tartan tradition.
The senior class builds a fence on campus in 1923 as a place for seniors to celebrate their time at CMU. Over time, this tradition evolves to one of free expression through painting for all (and only) CMU students.
Advancing a new era of cross-disciplinary education.
CMU breaks ground for the construction of the Richard King Mellon Hall of Sciences, a 338,900-square-foot building for science education and research, art and community, in 2024.
Studying learning.
Since 1968, the university's Children's School has been a place where play, learning, research and work have come together to advance understanding of child development.
Reading minds.
Launched in 2018, the Neuroscience Institute is working to unlock the mysteries of the brain through collaboration between biology, psychology, computer science, statistics and engineering researchers.

Thanks to the support of corporations and foundations, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust continues to offer world-class performances and visual arts and make arts education accessible in Pittsburgh and our surrounding communities.
As a sponsor, you will get exposure to the Trusts 800,000+ annual guests as well as get a chance to put your brand values into action. There are an abundance of opportunities to sponsor and support the Trust. Offerings each year include over 155 shows with 440 performances throughout the Trustâ€™s spaces, 60 films screened at the Harris Theater, 20 exhibits at our five galleries, four festivals including the Dollar Bank Three Rivers Arts Festival and Highmark First Night, and three gallery crawls. Our education programs reach 114 early childhood and K-12 schools as well as 18 universities and non-profits with over 24,000 students and teachers served. Thanks to corporate and foundation support, we are able to offer many of these exhibits, festivals, and educational programs to the public for FREE or at a very low cost.
We will customize sponsorship packages to align with your company, clients, and marketing goals. Sponsorships include an array of exclusive perks such as complimentary tickets, entertainment options for clients, employee ticket discounts, access to corporate networking events, and more.

Pok. Pok. Pok. That’s the unmistakable sound of a plastic pickleball striking a paddle, a sound that approximates, in both volume and pitch, the beeping backup signal of a garbage truck.
To those nearby, the sound can be unceasingly annoying. CMU engineering alumnus Bob Unetich is working to make it less so.
In a makeshift lab south of Pittsburgh, Bob, a player and official of the ever more popular game, studies paddles made from different materials or with different covers — felt pads on the faces of the paddles, for example, dampen the noise significantly — and balls of different varieties, including a new 3D-printed option. He also checks materials used to serve as sound barriers for pickleball courts for their ability to absorb or reflect the noise.
And, Bob says, just a few decibels can be the difference between a pickleball court that’s welcome in the neighborhood or unhappy neighbors complaining to the town council.

What is a Specialized Visit Group Tour?
We define a Group Tour as 10 or more prospective high school students and high school counselors visiting campus to learn more about the college experience and campus culture. Specialized Group Tour Experiences can vary depending on the size of the group and the date of the visit. To begin planning your group's visit to Carnegie Mellon, please read the considerations below.

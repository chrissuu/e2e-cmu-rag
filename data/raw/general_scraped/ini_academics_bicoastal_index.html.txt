We offer two degrees through bicoastal delivery: Master of Science in Mobile and IoT Engineering (MSMITE) and Master of Science in Information Technology-Information Security (MSIT-IS).
Students in the bicoastal degree programs divide their studies between Carnegie Mellon's Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley locations.
The Bicoastal Experience
Combining the rich, academic setting of main campus with hands-on industry experience in the heart of Silicon Valley, bicoastal information security and mobile and IoT engineering students have the best of both worlds. During their time in Silicon Valley, students gain unparalleled exposure in the nation's top tech hub by participating in hackathons, working alongside industry in the practicum project and networking with leaders in the field.

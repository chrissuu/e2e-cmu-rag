When you have a team this storied and with so many accolades, I think it would've been easy for the Steelers to focus on the 70s and 2000s eras only. What I absolutely loved about the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, however, is that is paints a complete picture of the Steelers franchise that lets guests truly understand the team.
The very first panel you'll see in the museum harkens back to football history, noting that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe (hey, that's my hometown!), just a short drive from Pittsburgh. You'll see the struggles of the early teams, the impact of World War II on the rosters and the difficulties Art Rooney had to overcome.
In the end, experiencing so much history about non-championship seasons made me appreciate those Ws even more. The Hall of Honor Museum is a celebration of all things Steelers, not just the Lombardi trophies, and show the tireless efforts of the Rooneys, coaches and players who led this team to the Super Bowl again and again.

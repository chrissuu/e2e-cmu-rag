School of Art
Art, unlike any other academic pursuit, challenges you to re-examine deeply-held beliefs, find uncertainty among rigid rules, and see the world in completely new ways. Here, the intrepidly curious and relentlessly daring collaborate on work that breaks barriers. Youâ€™ll develop your unique voice by experimenting with many different artistic materials and techniques and developing interdisciplinary critical thinking.

Giving brings art to life.
As a patron of the arts, you appreciate the many ways art and culture enriches all of our lives. We invite you to join others who share your love of the arts and who champion the preservation of Pittsburgh's downtown Cultural through your support as a Circles donor.
The Circles program of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust was established to recognize the generosity of a special group of individuals who have helped strengthen the foundation of Pittsburgh's world-renowned Cultural District with their annual contributions of $1,500 to $9,999.
From the stages to the galleries to the public art in the streets, your gift will ensure that the arts remain innovative, vibrant, and accessible to all for years to come. Your donation also helps create and sustain educational programming that inspires the next generation of arts patrons.
Thank you for considering making a Circles level gift today! As a thank you for your support we are happy to provide you the following enhancements for your next visit to the District.

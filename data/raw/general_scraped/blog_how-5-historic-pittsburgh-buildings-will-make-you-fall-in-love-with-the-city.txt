The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research , located at the corner of Fifth Ave. and Bellefield Ave. in the Oakland neighborhood is known for its groundbreaking industrial research, and contribution papers and patents, and training of some of the best scientists in the nation.
Built in 1937, the architecture was influenced by the Neoclassical Revival. You will notice this by its grand monolithic limestone columns (the largest in the world!) that will remind you of the Greek Parthenon in Ancient Greece. The columns (62 total) are each 36.5 feet high and 5.5 feet in diameter From a bird-eye's view, the building is a trapezoid shape forming two interior courts that let in plenty of light inside the laboratories.
In 1967, the Mellon Institute later merged with the Carnegie Institute of Technology to form the Carnegie Mellon University but its original name was retained. Because of its classical and elegant look, the the Mellon Institute attracts couples looking for the perfect wedding photo backdrop.

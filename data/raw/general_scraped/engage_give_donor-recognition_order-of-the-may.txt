Recognizing Loyal CMU Supporters
The Order of the May celebrates loyal and outstanding individuals whose consistent support to Carnegie Mellon University inspires others to make a similar impact. Membership begins with three years of uninterrupted annual giving, and those who reach 25 years of consecutive giving are formally inducted as lifetime members. At five years of giving, members receive their first milestone pin to recognize their dedication to the CMU community.
The Order of the May is named for Albert C. May (ENG 1921, 1922), who founded the Annual Fund at Carnegie Tech in 1947 and contributed to it every year until he passed away in 1998. The Order of the May honors all those who embody the spirit of generosity and characteristics for which Mr. May is remembered.
Commemorative Pins
Beginning in March 2024, commemorative Order of the May pins will be issued to donors every five years to celebrate significant milestones of consecutive giving: five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years and lifetime membership (awarded at 25 years). These tokens of appreciation serve as a tangible reminder of the collective impact CMU donors make.

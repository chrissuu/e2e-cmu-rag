Defund Police
Should Police Departments Be Defunded, if Not Abolished?
While there are multiple interpretations of “defund the police,” the basic definition is to move funding away from police departments and into community resources such as mental health experts, housing, and social workers. In the larger scope of the civil rights movement, some advocates would reallocate some police funding but keep police departments, others would combine defunding with other police reforms such as body cameras and bias training, and others see defunding as a small step toward ultimately abolishing police departments and the prison system entirely.

Defunding the police means to stop paying police to harass, exploit, and control poor communities of color over non-criminal behavior and low-level offenses like homelessness, drug possession, and mental health crises. It means investing the savings in real solutions.

As your President, I will defund federal involvement in policing, and the DEA. The federal government has created a police state, which instead of protecting and serving, imports nameless, faceless SWAT teams to our streets.
I will end the supplying of military equipment like tanks and tear gas to law enforcement (1033 program). Americans should not feel like enemy combatants in their own neighborhoods.
I will also end civil asset forfeiture, which is state-sanctioned highway robbery. Police are now able to steal assets from Americans (billions of dollars every year) and transfer the spoils to their own police budgets. This is wrong, and a massive conflict of interest.
I will end no-knock raids, which too often end up killing innocent bystanders like Breonna Taylor.
I will end the failed, destructive drug war used to justify such abuses.
And I will end qualified immunity so that citizens can take legal action against police brutality.
It will be up to each locality to decide what level of policing helps them balance public safety with sacred liberties. But getting federal money out, repealing draconian laws, and holding officers accountable, will make those choices far easier and our communities both safer and freer.

I don’t want to defund police.

Assault Weapons Ban
Should the U.S. Ban Assault Weapons?
A 1994 federal law that banned assault weapons expired in 2004 and has not been renewed by Congress. At least seven states have a version of an assault weapon ban, but no federal law currently exists. Proponents of a ban assert that military-style weapons should not be in the hands of the public and taking them away would reduce violent crimes. Opponents of a ban contend the weapons fall under Second Amendment protection and that crimes are more often committed with weapons not covered by the ban. [1]

I certainly stand by my opposition to Gun Control when it comes to taking guns from law-abiding citizens. You mention that the media describes the AR-15 as an ’assault rifle,’ which is one example of the many distortions they use to sell their agenda. However, the AR-15 does not fall under this category. Gun-banners are unfortunately preoccupied with the AR-15, magazine capacity, grips, and other aesthetics, precisely because of its popularity.

Ban the Box
Should Federal or State Governments Implement Ban the Box Legislation, which Prevents Employers from Asking about a Job Applicants’ Criminal History?
Ban the Box laws prohibit employers from asking about the criminal histories of job applicants on initial job applications, and, sometimes, in interviews or before conditional job offers. Some laws, such as California’s, also require employers to analyze whether a criminal history justifies denying someone a job. Hawaii first passed a ban the box law in 1998, and, as of Nov. 5, 2019, at least 35 states and DC and more than 150 cities have some sort of ban the box policy.
According to the National Employment Law Project, banning the box creates a fair chance for people with convictions to compete for jobs. Opponents state that ban the box legislation can lead to fewer jobs for people of color as employers more widely discriminate against groups more likely to have criminal records. [2] [3] [4]

Cash Bail
Should the U.S. End the Cash Bail System?
People who have been arrested are sometimes allowed to remain out of jail until their court date if they pay cash bail in an amount decided by a judge. The bail is intended to guarantee that they will appear in court, because the government will keep their money if they do not show up as ordered. People who cannot afford bail and do not have collateral for a private bail bond are required to await their trial or court hearings in jail.
Proponents of cash bail argue that the system keeps dangerous criminals off the streets while they await trial. Opponents argue that the system is designed to hurt low-income people of color. [5] [6]

Cash bail is the modern-day debtors’ prison. The cash bail system incarcerates people who are presumed innocent. And, it disproportionately harms low-income individuals.

There are more just and equally effective ways than cash bail to ensure that a person charged with a crime shows up in court. Judges should have the leeway to detain those charged with very serious crimes and who pose a significant risk to society - so long as detainees are granted a speedy trial, as is guaranteed by the Constitution. We must immediately end the War on Drugs and any other law on the books for which there is no victim.

No. From bad policies like the War on Drugs, that set the stage for injustice, to a flawed criminal justice system, such government incompetence precludes any moral justification for executions. No life should be taken when there is any chance of innocence, and governments in the United States have failed on this front far too often.
A 2014 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences issued a conservative estimate that as many as one in every 25 citizens sentenced to death is actually innocent. The Innocence Project reports that as many as 367 people have been exonerated by DNA evidence after serving an average of 14 years in federal custody.

DC Statehood
Should the District of Columbia Be Given Statehood?
The District of Columbia (Washington, DC) is a federal district under the jurisdiction of the United States Congress. The district has two Senators and one Representative in Congress who can introduce legislation but cannot vote on legislation. All local DC legislation must be approved by Congress. The 702,000 residents of DC pay the highest per-capita federal income taxes in the country but have no voting power to determine how that money is spent.

Guantánamo Bay Detention Center
Should the Guantánamo Bay Detention Center Remain Open?
The Guantánamo Bay Detention Center, also referred to as Gitmo, sits next to the US Guantánamo Bay Naval Station in southeastern Cuba. Existing structures were repurposed after 9/11 to hold "enemy combatants" in the War on Terror. Because the detention facilities were not on US soil, the Bush administration argued the detainees were not covered by the US Constitution. On June 12, 2008, the US Supreme Court ruled that detainees have the Constitutional right to challenge their detention. About 780 people have been held at Gitmo since 2002, with the peak population at 684 in June 2003.
On Nov. 18, 2009, President Obama signed an executive order to close Gitmo within a year. A year later, Obama announced the detention center had not yet closed because of challenges in relocating detainees. The Guantánamo Bay Detention Center was not closed and still held 41 or 42 detainees by the time Obama left office in Jan. 2017. President Trump vowed to keep the facility open to fight terrorism. 40 detainees remain in the facility. [13] [14] [15]

Net Neutrality
Should the Federal Government Adopt Net Neutrality Rules?
In Jan. 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to repeal net neutrality rules established under President Obama that required internet service providers to treat all internet traffic equally.
Proponents of net neutrality say it preserves free speech on the internet by preventing ISPs from blocking lawful online content. Opponents of net neutrality say that internet service should be free from unnecessary and heavy-handed government regulation. [18] [19]

Restore strong Net Neutrality protections, the bedrock of digital civil rights and equality online. The United States needs Net Neutrality  the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should not be allowed to block, slow down, or discriminate against legal content. This requires the next FCC Chair and Commissioners to fully restore the 2015 Net Neutrality protections and legal framework, and the FCC’s ability to enforce those protections. The open Internet has been an incredible force for social and economic change. It has been used by Black Lives Matter to expose racist police violence, by Dreamers to advocate for their rights and by startup businesses and artists among others. Net neutrality is essential to prevent corporate interests from discriminating for profit and limiting what users can see or say online.

Starting in late 2020, the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act signed by President Trump will grant 12 weeks of paid leave to federal employees. An estimated 12% of private-sector workers in the US have access to paid family leave through their employers.

Public Sector Unions
Should Public Sector Employees Have the Right to Unionize?

Public sector unions provide the voice that workers – including educators, social workers, firefighters, and police officers – need to ensure they can serve their communities. And, public sector unions have been and continue to be an essential pathway to the middle class for workers of color and women, who disproportionately work in the public sector...

The national security interests of the United States require expedient and efficient decision making. When new missions emerge or existing ones evolve, the Department of Defense requires maximum flexibility to respond to threats to carry out its mission of protecting the American people. This flexibility requires that military and civilian leadership manage their organizations to cultivate a lethal, agile force adaptive to new technologies and posture changes. Where collective bargaining is incompatible with these organizations’ missions, the Department of Defense should not be forced to sacrifice its national security mission and, instead, seek relief through third parties and administrative fora.

Reparations for Slavery
Should the Federal Government Pay Reparations to the Descendants of Slaves?
Reparations are generally payments (monetary and otherwise) given to a group that has suffered harm. Holocaust survivors and Japanese-Americans who were interned in the United States during World War II have received reparations.
Arguments for reparations date to 1865 when General William T. Sherman authorized 400,000 acres of land from South Carolina into Florida to be divided into forty-acre plots and given to freed slaves. Because he later gave orders to lend mules, the phrase "forty acres and a mule" became popular. However, when Andrew Johnson became President after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, he rescinded the order and reverted the land back to the white landowners. Other efforts and arguments have been made since though the issue remains divisive. [29]

We need to phase out welfare, which has failed disadvantaged Americans.
From 1959 to 1969, the poverty rate was nearly cut in half while government did little to address poverty. However, after the war on poverty was fully implemented in the early seventies, progress stopped. Fifty years of federal anti-poverty programs – zero impact.
Government anti-poverty programs don’t work. The real cure for poverty is a vibrant economy that generates plentiful jobs and high wages, combined with an affordable cost of living.
As President, I will work to eliminate policies that cripple economic growth. I will give special attention to regulations driving up the cost of housing and health care, as well as those creating barriers to creating new businesses or entering professions.
Finally, I will work to repeal laws and regulations that prevent individuals and charitable organizations from helping those in need, including free healthcare clinics. Until we have successfully replaced failed welfare programs with a vibrant economy, we should require beneficiaries to work, and make exceptions for situations such as legitimate disability.

Welfare reform should also include a guaranteed job for all those who want to work...
The TANF program should be reformed in a number of ways: more emphasis on job creation, including transitional jobs that include education and training; stronger support for those making the transition to work, such as universal child care and health care; expanded access to job and skills training; expanded access to both basic education (e.g., GED, English as Second Language, adult literacy) and college; and better assessment of individuals’ barriers to employment. If work participation is to be mandated, the number of required hours must be dramatically scaled back to reflect the reality that almost all of the participants are engaged in child rearing activities. In addition, the safety net, starting with higher benefits, should be dramatically increased for those unable to work, starting with those who have disabilities and/or who are caregivers for other family members.

Universal Basic Income (UBI)
Should the US Implement a Universal Basic Income (UBI)?
Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a cash payment given at regular intervals by the government to all residents, regardless of their earnings or employment status. Proponents of UBI say that it reduces poverty and income inequality, encourages employment and skills training, and values normally unpaid roles such as homemakers and caregivers. They also say it improves the health of recipients and empowers women. Opponents of UBI say that it does not reduce poverty, that it deprives the poor of needed targeted support, provides a disincentive to work, and weakens the economy. They also say it is unaffordable and less effective than targeted aid and welfare.

I noted that some in Silicon Valley whose fortunes are built on automation have proposed a universal basic income on the theory that there will no longer be enough work to go around. But that misses the point. Americans have always defined themselves by what they do and how they provide for their families. What the idea of a universal basic income misses is that a job is about more than a paycheck. It is about dignity and one’s place in their community. What Americans want is a good job and a steady paycheck, not a government check or a consolation prize for missing out on the American dream.
The American people are willing to work and when they work they’re entitled to be justly rewarded. That’s the American promise.

The income guarantee we will enact is often called the Negative Income Tax (NIT). We prefer it to the Universal Basic Income (UBI) because it targets the benefits to those who need it, provides a sufficient benefit to end poverty, and costs a fraction of a UBI.

Wealth Tax

A wealth tax would require the nation’s wealthiest households (over $30-50 million, depending on the specific plan) to pay an annual tax on their assets, including property, investments, art, yachts, and more. This would be in addition to income, property, and estate taxes. [30]

Rather than failing to build the economy by reducing taxes on the wealthy, we need to actually build the economy by creating a strong foundation of purchasing power in the working class by ending poverty and economic insecurity... [I]nstitute a wealth tax, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, proposed taxing wealth in excess of $50 million at 2 percent per year and wealth above $1 billion at an additional 1 percent tax. This would affect only seventy-five thousand households and would raise some $2.8 trillion over a decade.

No. Claims that taxing the rich will solve our problems never turn out to be true. They disincentive the entrepreneurs we need to generate jobs and prosperity. They usually generate less wealth and therefore lower total tax revenues.

COVID-19 School Reopening
Should Schools Reopen during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Pandemic?
During the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, schools in most states closed during the spring 2020 session. The debate over whether and how to safely reopen schools for the 2020 fall session continues into Sep. 2020 as schools across the country consider online-only, in-person, and hybrid instruction. A national order to close or open schools has not been issued as of Aug. 27, 2020. [31]

Everyone wants schools to fully reopen for in-person instruction. Creating the conditions to make it happen should be a top national priority. Joe Biden believes that the decision about when to reopen safely should be made by state, tribal, and local officials, based on science and in consultation with communities and tribal governments. It should be made with the safety of students and educators in mind. And, it should be made recognizing that if we do this wrong, we will put lives at risk and set our economy and our country back.
Joe Biden has a simple five-step roadmap to support local decision-making on reopening schools safely and to help students whose learning was interrupted:
Get the Virus Under Control…
Set National Safety Guidelines, Empower Local Decision-Making: The Trump Administration’s chaotic and politicized response has left school districts to improvise a thousand hard decisions on their own. Schools need clear, consistent, effective national guidelines, not mixed messages and political ultimatums...
Provide Emergency Funding for Public Schools and Child Care Providers…
Ensuring High-Quality Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic... Biden would mobilize a large-scale U.S. Department of Education effort to work with practitioners to develop, adopt, and share the latest tools and best practices to ensure high-quality learning during this pandemic.
Closing the COVID-19 Educational Equity Gap: Despite the best efforts of educators, students, and families, this crisis, coupled with long-standing racial inequities, has led many students, especially low-income students and students of color, to struggle and fall behind. New research shows that some students could even lose an entire year of academic gains.”

Most mass shootings occur where guns are prohibited. A murderous criminal isn’t stopped by a ’gun free zone,’ and will often head specifically for a gun-free zone where there will be fewer armed people who could stop him.
Law-abiding citizens who leave their guns at home, including teachers in classrooms, are left defenseless. Gun-free zones give mass murderers time to slaughter even more children before anyone can bring them down.

The concept I’m announcing today will align my student debt relief proposal with my forward-looking college tuition proposal. Under this plan, I propose to forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities for debt-holders earning up to $125,000, with appropriate phase-outs to avoid a cliff. The federal government would pay the monthly payment in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off. This benefit would also apply to individuals holding federal student loans for tuition from private HBCUs and MSIs.

Immediately cancel a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person, as proposed by Senator Warren in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.

Relieve student debt by enacting a federal student loan program that will provide relief from existing student loan debts and provide affordable zero-interest loans going forward.

Donald Trump
I am proud to announce that I am taking executive action to ensure that our wounded warriors are not saddled with mountains of student debt.
In a few moments, I will sign a memorandum directing the Department of Education to eliminate every penny of federal student loan debt owed by American veterans who are completely and permanently disabled. Incredible.
Nobody can complain about that, right? Nobody can complain about that. The debt of these disabled veterans will be entirely erased. It’ll be gone. And you’ll sleep well tonight.
Altogether, this action will wipe out an average of $30,000 in debt owed by more than 25,000 eligible veterans who have made immense sacrifices — the ultimate sacrifice, in many — in many ways, for our nation.

Editor’s Note: The Executive Office of the President wrote in its Aug. 15, 2018 "Statement of Administration Policy: Substitute Amendment to H.R. 6157 — Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019," available at whitehouse.gov:
The Administration opposes the wasteful $350 million funding level for a temporary benefit in the Federal Direct Student Loan program that expands Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility. In contrast, the Administration proposes to eliminate the PSLF program, which unfairly favors certain career choices over others, and instead focuses assistance on undergraduate student borrowers from all professions through a single income-based repayment plan.
Student Sexual Misconduct Allegations
Should Title IX Give More Protection to College Students Accused of Sexual Misconduct?
On May 6, 2020 Betsy DeVos issued a new Title IX rule that "narrows the definition of sexual harassment and requires schools to produce evidence and allow for the cross-examination of students who say they were assaulted" in order to "ensure that those accused of sexual assault receive due process." Critics argue that it could silence victims. [40]

Yes. Universities receiving federal funds have a legal obligation to protect students from gender-based violence and harassment – including sexual assault. Universities are under equal obligation to provide access to education for those who are accused - but have not been convicted - of sexual assault. False reports and mistaken identity are relatively rare, but they do happen. The rights of accused students to education and facilities must also be protected. Disciplinary measures and due process must uphold the rights of all students. We can (and must) support survivors without creating new victims with unjust systems.

Editor’s Note: The Trump Adminstration published the rule giving more protection to college students accused of sexual misconduct. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stated,
Too many students have lost access to their education because their school inadequately responded when a student filed a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual assault... This new regulation requires schools to act in meaningful ways to support survivors of sexual misconduct, without sacrificing important safeguards to ensure a fair and transparent process. We can and must continue to fight sexual misconduct in our nation’s schools, and this rule makes certain that fight continues.

It’s wrong. And, it will be put to a quick end in January 2021, because as president, I’ll be right where I always have been throughout my career — on the side of survivors, who deserve to have their voices heard, their claims taken seriously and investigated, and their rights upheld... It lets colleges off the hook for protecting students, by permitting them to choose to investigate only more extreme acts of violence and harassment and requiring them to investigate in a way that dissuades survivors from coming forward. Survivors deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. Today, Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump published a rule that flies in the face of that belief and guarantees that college campuses will be less safe for our nation’s young people

Tuition-Free College

Candidates who are in favor of any version of free college, including tuition-free community college, tuition-free four-year degrees, and two years tuition-free at a four-year school, are considered pro to this question.

We can pay for this with the [Trump administration] tax cut that we’re going to reverse as well as eliminating some of these loopholes that make no sense. Let me give you one example. I don’t want to be generic about it. I want to give you an example. For example, you could send everyone in this state [New Hampshire] to a community college for free. And the entire United States for free, if they’re qualified. Cutting in half the cost of... a four-year degree, because in every state you’re able to transfer these community college credits to the state university, cutting in half the cost of education, a four-year education if that’s what you desire. But, here’s the deal, it costs six billion dollars a year. There goes that big-spending Democrat Biden, man, look at him. I can eliminate one of the 1.6 trillion dollars in loopholes. It’s called stepped-up basis... If you just eliminate that one out of one trillion six hundred plus billion dollars, every single solitary kid could go to qualify to go to community college for free, cutting in half the cost of their four-year education, increasing productivity by 2/10 of one percent by most studies, as well as having eleven billion dollars to put toward the deficit.

They are letting them go up and the problem is the students are getting crushed because, again, the government just keeps giving them more and more money and the students give them to the college. So it’s not fair. We’re going to really look into that because we have to keep it down. We have to keep it down. Some of the colleges do a good job. Many of them, I don’t think they even care what the costs are because they get so much money. We’re going to do something for the students.

Super PACs
Should 2020 Presidential Election Candidates Accept Support from Super PACs?
A Super PAC (political action committee) can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money for or against candidates in elections. Super PACs emerged in the wake of two court rulings in 2010 that said imposing limits on certain contributions to independent organizations was unconstitutional.
Super PACs are allowed to accept donations in unlimited amounts from corporations, unions, associations, and individuals. By contrast, candidates are restricted to donations of $2,700 from individuals per election cycle (there are two cycles per year) and cannot accept donations from corporations, associations, or unions.
Coordination between Super PACs, which can be formed without consent from a candidate, and political campaigns is forbidden.

The uncertainties of the coronavirus pandemic make mail-in balloting the only way to ensure all voters can vote in November. The federal government should enact a program with funding and standards to mail all registered voters a mail-in ballot for the November election. The program should provide sufficient funding to print and pay postage for tens of millions of mail-in ballots and envelopes, including postage for pre-paid return envelopes. It should ensure that all registered voters receive a ballot automatically, can request a replacement if they don’t, and can return it by Election Day. It should provide sufficient funding to ensure that the human and technological resources, like ballot scanners to count votes quickly and accurately are in place. This program should be enacted immediately in order to get the system in place by the November election. The mail-in ballot program will have the added benefit of creating an auditable paper trail for recounts.

On the civil rights front, we see renewed attacks on voting rights across the nation. This year alone [2014], there were 83 initiatives in 29 states to limit access to the ballot box in the name of preventing corruption where no corruption was found. In the name of preventing widespread fraud where none was occurring. States like Wisconsin, which passed a voter ID law in the name of combating voter impersonation. That was the rationale. According to the federal court, the state, and I quote, ’could not point to a single instance of known voter impersonation occurring in Wisconsin at any time in the recent past.’ Or, in my native state of Pennsylvania, where a state court judge ruled that the state ’wholly failed to show any evidence of in-person voter fraud.’ But the fiction of widespread voter fraud continues to persist.

America is currently in the midst of a new wave of disenfranchisement. Since 2000, the number of states requiring voter ID has increased from 14 to 33. A 2013 Supreme Court decision struck down provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required pre-clearance by the federal government of changes to election laws in jurisdictions that had historically disenfranchised blacks and other people of color. In the wake of that decision, 17 states adopted laws requiring stricter voter ID requirements. Most of these laws require government-issued photo ID, which often requires a birth certificate to obtain. The time and cost of obtaining these documents discourages low-income people from registering to vote... Obviously, the fight against onerous voter ID laws must continue.

Opponents would prefer to leave oil and gas in the ground due to climate change and environmental concerns. Environmental organizations such as The Wilderness Society argue that too much area is leased to oil and gas developers for fossil fuel extraction (about 90% of public land in western states), and say that not enough land is made available for conservation efforts or public use.

The previous administration tried to put America’s vast energy resources under lock and key. ’We don’t want energy.’ I don’t know what they were thinking. And they tried to put energy producers out of business. But no more. It’s a great business. It’s a vital business for our country.
We’re opening up ANWR in Alaska, one of the biggest sites anywhere in the world...
We’re unlocking the full oil and gas potential of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico...
Since I took office, the United States has increased oil production by over 3.2 million barrels per day. That’s an incredible number...
Unfortunately, politicians in California, New York, and other states risk our economy and our national security by blocking vital energy resources from being developed and energy infrastructure, like this, from being built. These states could be ports for shipping energy to our friends and allies, but instead of helping our partners, they’re hurting America.
I have a simple message for these politicians that do such damage to our country: We should be producing energy at home, not enriching foreign adversaries abroad."

We should sell land owned by the federal government wherever feasible and use the proceeds to liquidate large taxpayer liabilities such as Social Security. This will also force fuel companies to pay market rates for use of the land.
I aim to create an even more level playing field by ending federal government subsidies of all forms of energy. Nuclear energy gets the least. The fossil fuel industry gets many billions of dollars every year. Wind and solar get huge subsidies, relative to the kilowatts of energy they produce. The whole energy industry is driven by crony capitalism, with very little competition.
Nuclear energy is likely to do very well in a competitive marketplace to the detriment of fossil fuels.

Fracking
Should Fracking Be Allowed?
Hydraulic fracking is a process of collecting natural gas and oil. A mixture of water, sand, and chemicals are pumped underground at a high pressure via a drilled hole. The sand mixture causes small cracks or fractures created underground in the rock layer, which allows the natural gas or oil to flow up a drilled hole and to the surface for collection.

I’ve argued against any more oil drilling or gas drilling on federal lands that we can -- and to stop that. I think we should, in fact, be looking at what exists now and making a judgment whether or not the -- those, in fact, that are there, those wells that are there, whether or not they’re dangerous, whether or not they’ve already done the damage, and what we can do from there by trying to change the attitude of the members of the governors of the various states and the state legislatures.
Now, we could pass national legislation, but I don’t think we’d get it done, in terms of getting the votes to get it done, to say all fracking that’s going on now ends unless you can show there’s some physical security need or worried about explosions, et cetera, which is a legitimate thing to worry about. But I would not allow any more.

Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.

Keystone XL
Should the Keystone XL Pipeline Be Built?
The Keystone XL pipeline was first proposed in 2008 under President George W. Bush. The proposal included oil facilities and an 875-mile pipeline starting in Alberta, Canada that would carry up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day to Nebraska, where the pipeline would join an existing pipeline and carry oil to Gulf Coast terminals.
President Obama repeatedly denied applications for the Keystone XL and vetoed the 2015 Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act. President Trump invited resubmission of the application on Jan. 24, 2017 and issued a presidential permit for the project on Mar. 29, 2019. TransCanada announced construction would move forward on Mar. 31, 2020. However, a court ruling revoked a crucial permit on Apr. 15, 2020, further delaying the project. [53] [54] [55]

China Tariffs
Should the Tariffs Imposed on China by President Trump Be Maintained?
In July 2018, the Trump administration imposed tariffs (essentially taxes on a certain type of import or export) on industrial components and technology products from China. Beijing reacted with higher tariffs on US farm goods, which caused the Trump administration to enact and threaten to enact even more tariffs, which would affect most Chinese imports to the United States by 2020. The first round of tariffs in July and Aug 2018 included $50 billion of Chinese products including semiconductors, industrial components, and machinery. Tariffs were expanded and increased in Sep. 2018, May 2019, and Sep. 2019. A proposed increase in Oct. 2019 was canceled. [58]

The Treaty also provides an important means of increasing mutual understanding of military forces and activities, thus easing tensions and strengthening confidence and security, not only in the area covered by the Treaty, but in other areas as well."

Editor’s Note: In a statement from Secretary of State Pompeo the Trump administration announced:
Tomorrow [May 22, 2020], the United States will submit notice of its decision to withdraw from the Treaty on Open Skies to the Treaty Depositaries and to all other States Parties to the Treaty. Effective six months from tomorrow, the United States will no longer be a party to the Treaty. We may, however, reconsider our withdrawal should Russia return to full compliance with the Treaty....
At its core, the Treaty was designed to provide all signatories an increased level of transparency and mutual understanding and cooperation, regardless of their size. Russia’s implementation and violation of Open Skies, however, has undermined this central confidence-building function of the Treaty – and has, in fact, fueled distrust and threats to our national security – making continued U.S. participation untenable."

In announcing the intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, President Trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership. With the world confronting the health and economic consequences of a global pandemic, the United States should be leading the international community, working with allies, and avoiding destabilizing actions....
The Trump Administration says it is withdrawing from the Treaty because Russia is cheating. There are real concerns that Russia is not complying fully with the Treaty. It has improperly imposed restrictions on overflights over certain regions (Kaliningrad and the Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia), to which the United States and other parties have objected. These Russian violations should be addressed not by withdrawing from the Treaty, but by seeking to resolve them through the Treaty’s implementation and dispute mechanism. That is exactly how other disputes over Russian implementation have been resolved, including altitude restrictions over Chechnya.

Withdrawing Troops from Syria
Should the US Have Withdrawn Troops from Northern Syria in Oct. 2019?
American troops allied with Syrian Kurdish forces to fight ISIS in northern Syria. About 1,000 US troops remained in Syria as of Sep. 2019. The White House announced on Oct. 6, 2019 that Turkey, a NATO ally, would be moving forward with a "long-planned operation into northern Syria" but that US forces would not be involved and "will no longer be in the immediate area."
Turkey launched a military incursion into northern Syria that US Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said resulted in "a potential ISIS resurgence, possible war crimes and a growing humanitarian crisis." On Oct. 14, 2019, President Trump stated, "As I have said, I am withdrawing the remaining United States service members from northeast Syria."

Should Abortion Be Legal?
The debate over whether abortion should be a legal option continues to divide Americans long after the US Supreme Court’s 7-2 decision on Roe v.

I support the legal framework established in the Roe v. Wade decision. During the first trimester, it is up to the pregnant woman to decide whether to get an abortion. During the second trimester laws can only regulate abortion to protect the health of the mother. During the third trimester, or after fetal viability pursuant to Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), laws can restrict or prohibit abortions except in cases where it was necessary to protect the mother’s health. This framework should be codified into federal law by an act of Congress. I oppose targeted regulation of abortion clinics and providers through laws or policies that go beyond what is necessary to ensure patients’ safety. I support laws that allow physicians as well as non-physician health professionals, including physicians’ assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives, to perform abortion procedures.

Import Prescription Drugs
Should Americans Be Able to Import Prescription Drugs?
A Feb. 2020 poll found that 78% of Americans favor being allowed to import prescription drug from licensed Canadian pharmacies. The support crosses party lines with 75% of Democrats, 82% of Independents, and 75% of Republicans favoring importation.
According to several studies, importing drugs from Canada would lower prescription drug prices for Americans by about 28% to 35% of the prices in the US. Under current law, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has to certify that a drug is safe for importation. Four former FDA commissioners have voiced concerns about the government’s ability to ensure the safety of imported drugs. A 2004 HHS report noted the risk that allowing the importation of drugs would harm pharmaceutical profits and result in less investment in the development of new drugs. [67]

Between 1999 and 2018, there were almost 450,000 opioid overdose deaths from prescription and street drugs. Naloxone (Narcan) is an opioid antagonist drug that can reverse an opioid overdose if it is administered in time. The drug is available as an injectable, an autoinjectable, and a nasal spray. Only paramedics, ER doctors, and other trained responders may administer the injectable. In some states friends, family members, and other community members are allowed to administer the autoinjectable and the nasal spray. Between 1996 and June 2014, Naloxone reversed over 26,000 opioid overdoses. Increased access to the drug results in 14% fewer opioid deaths, with the possibility to prevent up to 21%. [69] [70] [71]

Immigration
Border Wall
Should the US Continue to Build a Border Wall at the US/Mexico Border?
The US-Mexico border had about 654 miles of barriers before President Trump took office. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the entire border, which spans about 2,000 miles. US Customs and Border Protection announced in July 2019 that 50 miles of new wall projects had been completed, and that it had received funding for 201 to 205 miles of new border barriers. [78]

My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers. It’s a tremendous problem...
[A]s part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense.
The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year — vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico...
Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.

There will not be another foot of wall constructed in my administration. I’m gonna make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it and at the ports of entry — that’s where all the bad stuff is at.
Justine Coleman, "Biden Says He Would Stop Border Wall Construction as President," thehill.com, Aug. 6, 2020
Editor’s Note: Biden previously expressed a pro opinion on this question:
I voted for a fence, I voted, unlike most Democrats — and some of you won’t like it — I voted for 700 miles of fence [by voting for the Secure Fence Act]. But, let me tell you, we can build a fence 40 stories high, unless you change the dynamic in Mexico and — and you will not like this, and — punish American employers who knowingly violate the law when, in fact, they hire illegals. Unless you do those two things, all the rest is window dressing.
Now, I know I’m not supposed to say it that bluntly, but they’re the facts, they’re the facts. And so everything else we do is in between here. Everything else we do is at the margins. And the reason why I add that parenthetically, why I believe the fence is needed does not have anything to do with immigration as much as drugs... And let me tell you something folks, people are driving across that border with tons, tons, hear me, tons of everything from byproducts for methamphetamine to cocaine to heroin and it’s all coming up through corrupt Mexico."

DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)
Should the US End the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Policy?
DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) is an Obama administration policy implemented on June 15, 2012. DACA prevents undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children from being deported and allows those immigrants to get work permits. The undocumented immigrants who participate in the program are referred to as Dreamers, a reference to the DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) that was first introduced in the Senate on Aug. 1, 2001 by Orrin Hatch (R-UT) but did not pass.
On Sep. 5, 2017 President Trump rescinded DACA, an action that was met with two federal court rulings saying the policy could not be ended on Mar. 5, 2018 as planned. The Trump administration appealed those federal court rulings to the US Supreme Court, but on Feb. 26, 2018, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. DACA therefore remained in effect. The issue eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in three DACA cases on Nov. 12, 2019. A ruling is expected by summer 2020.

Imagine a young girl, age 4 or 5, traveling with her parents into the United States as they make the hard decision to pursue a better life here. Imagine that child growing up as your student, your co-worker, your friend. Because of the president’s decision today [to rescind DACA], she now must live in fear that she will soon be thrown out and sent back to a country she has never known.
This story speaks to the experience of roughly 800,000 people known as DREAMers here in America today. These children didn’t choose to come here, but now many of them are grown with families of their own. They’re paying taxes. They’ve joined the workforce. They went to college. Some of them joined the military. Now, they’ll be sent to countries they don’t even remember.
These people are all Americans. So let’s be clear: throwing them out is cruel. It is inhumane. And it is not America. Congress and the American people now have an obligation to step up and show our neighbors that they’re welcome here, in the only place they’ve ever called home.

The deal was done. DACA is going to be just fine. We’re putting it in. It’s going to be just fine.

You have breaking news, but I’m signing a big immigration bill...I’m going to do a big executive order. I have the power to do it as president and I’m going to make DACA a part of it. But, we put it in, and we’ll probably going to then be taking it out. We’re working out the legal complexities right now, but I’m going to be signing a very major immigration bill as an executive order, which Supreme Court now, because of the DACA decision, has given me the power to do that...[W]hat I’m going to do is that they’re going to part of a much bigger bill on immigration. It’s going to be a very big bill, a very good bill, and merit-based bill and it will include DACA, and I think people are going to be very happy... But one of the aspects of the bill is going to be DACA. We’re going to have a road to citizenship.
Rafael Bernal, "Trump Says He’ll Sign Order with ’Road to Citizenship’ for DACA Recipients," thehill.com, July 10, 2020
Editor’s Note: Trump previously expressed a pro opinion on this question:
In June of 2012, President Obama bypassed Congress to give work permits, social security numbers, and federal benefits to approximately 800,000 illegal immigrants currently between the ages of 15 and 36. The typical recipients of this executive amnesty, known as DACA, are in their twenties. Legislation offering these same benefits had been introduced in Congress on numerous occasions and rejected each time...
The temporary implementation of DACA by the Obama Administration, after Congress repeatedly rejected this amnesty-first approach, also helped spur a humanitarian crisis – the massive surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America including, in some cases, young people who would become members of violent gangs throughout our country, such as MS-13...
Therefore, in the best interests of our country, and in keeping with the obligations of my office, the Department of Homeland Security will begin an orderly transition and wind-down of DACA...
As I’ve said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion – but through the lawful Democratic process – while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve.

Decriminalize Border
Should the US Decriminalize Illegal Border Crossings?
Title 8 of the federal code makes entering the United States without authorization a misdemeanor punishable by prison and fines. In Apr. 2018, the Trump Administration announced a "zero tolerance" policy for illegal entry, resulting in family separations when parents making unauthorized border crossings were prosecuted and imprisoned under Title 8 Section 1325 of the US code. Decriminalizing border crossings would make illegal entry a civil offense as opposed to a criminal one. [79] [80]

It is the policy of this Administration to rigorously enforce our immigration laws. Under our laws, the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is at a designated port of entry at an appropriate time. When an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else, that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under section 1325(a) of title 8, United States Code. This Administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] until and unless Congress directs otherwise.

Path to Citizenship
Should Immigrants Who Entered the US Illegally Be Denied a Path to Citizenship?
“Path to citizenship” (sometimes called “amnesty”) refers to allowing undocumented immigrants to become citizens via a process that may include additional requirements (such as fees, background checks, or additional waiting times) to the naturalization process for documented immigrants.
Opponents of illegal immigration say that people who break the law by crossing the US border without proper documentation or by overstaying their visas should be deported and not rewarded with a path to citizenship and access to social services. They argue that people in the country illegally are criminals and social and economic burdens to law-abiding, tax-paying Americans.
Other people say that illegal immigration benefits the US economy through additional tax revenue, expansion of the low-cost labor pool, and increased money in circulation. They contend that immigrants bring good values, have motivations consistent with the American dream, perform jobs that Americans won’t take, and that opposition to immigration stems from racism.

Along with the freedom to marry comes the freedom to build a family. Biden believes that LGBTQ+ people and same-sex couples should be able to build and protect their families. Yet many government-funded foster care and adoption agencies still discriminate against LGBTQ+ families or place additional burdens on these families during the foster care or adoption process. Similarly, these agencies often put LGBTQ+ youth in care at risk by failing to place them with safe and affirming families. In November 2019, the Trump-Pence Administration proposed a rule that will permit adoption and foster care agencies that discriminate against LGBTQ+ families to receive government funding. As President, Biden will repeal the rule, if implemented, and work to ensure that qualified families are not discriminated against based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, sex, marital status, disability, or religion and that child welfare agencies put the interests of children first, including those who are LGBTQ+.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act has been used to justify discrimination outside of religious institutions, particularly against women and LGBTQIA people. The US rejected the claims of religious institutions that “religious freedom” gave them the right to practice racial discrimination. We need to extend these civil rights to protect women and LGBTQIA people against discrimination by religious institutions.
Church and state should be separated. Freedom of religious belief and practice in religious institutions should be protected. However, if a religious institution, including hospitals and clinics controlled by a religious institution, receives public money, it is now a public accommodations and the government has the right to and should enforce civil rights laws, including reproductive freedom and abortion rights and laws against discrimination. The same rule should apply to private businesses engaged in commerce with the public—the government has the right and duty to prosecute violations of civil rights, reproductive freedom, and anti-discrimination laws by private businesses.
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act should be amended by the Do No Harm Act (H.R. 1450; S. 593), which would ensure that federal law protects religious liberty but does not let religion be misused to harm others, including the RFRA to discriminate, to ignore wage and labor protections, to avoid compliance with laws protecting against child abuse, or to thwart access to health care guaranteed by law.

Transgender Military Service
Should Transgender People Be Allowed to Serve in the US Military?
In June 2016, then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter lifted the Pentagon’s long-standing ban on transgender people serving openly in the US military. Medical costs for gender-affirming surgery were to be covered by the Pentagon for uniformed military personnel.
In July 2017, President Trump tweeted that no transgender people would be allowed "to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military." The policy change went through several courts before landing at the US Supreme Court where, in a 5-4 ruling, the ban was allowed to stand.
The ban, which went into effect on Apr. 12, 2019, includes a prohibition against transitioning for transgender troops and recruits, a requirement that most serve as their birth gender, and allows a service member to be "discharged based on a diagnosis of gender dysphoria." Gender dysphoria is when a person is distressed due to an inconsistency between their biological sex and their gender identity. [90]

Shannon Scott: I served over ten years in the United States military and two combat tours in Iraq, and after that service, I was forced to make one of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever been forced to make, and that was to choose between serving my country and my true identity as a transgender woman.
Joe Biden: If I were President, you would not have to choose. Not a joke. You would not have to choose. The fact of the matter is that we’re in a position where transgender men and women are in a position where they should be able to do anything anybody else in the world can do. There should be no difference.

victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you

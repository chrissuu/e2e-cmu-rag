BCSA Program
The Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts (BCSA) intercollege degree program combines the strengths of the College of Fine Arts (CFA) and the School of Computer Science (SCS). This degree provides an ideal technical, critical and conceptual foundation for students interested in pursuing fields that comprehensively meld technology and the arts, such as game design, computer animation, computer music, recording technologies, interactive stagecraft, robotic art and other emerging media. Students choose their arts concentration from the following schools in CFA: Architecture, Art, Design, Drama or Music. Students choose their computer science concentration established by the School of Computer Science.
The BCSA curriculum has three main components: general education requirements, fine arts concentration requirements and computer science concentration requirements. Each student's course of study is structured so they can complete this rigorous program in four years.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and SCS. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in SCS to guide their focus in computer science.

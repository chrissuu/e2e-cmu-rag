The trailer opens with stunning views high above the familiar Pittsburgh city skyline, home to “The Fred Rogers Studio.” Filming in downtown Pittsburgh took place in September of 2018 and Hanks was frequently spotted doing research for the film in Rogers’ hometown of Latrobe, PA, just outside the city. Based on a true story, the movie follows Mister Rogers as he befriends cynical journalist, Lloyd Vogel [Matthew Rhys] who ends up discovering a true American hero famous for his red sweater and unconditional kindness.

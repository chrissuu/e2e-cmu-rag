Paving Schedule
Please see the table below for upcoming dates of street resurfacing work.
All streets and dates are subject to change or being postponed based on the weather and other factors.
The following list includes streets that will be paved by the City of Pittsburgh. Additional streets may be paved through utility coordination or mechanical patching. Please look for "No Parking" signs on your street and follow the day and time restrictions on the signs, even if there is not active work. Signs should be posted at least 48 hours before work begins.
Please wait while the schedule loads.

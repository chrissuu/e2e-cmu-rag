August Wilson African American Cultural Center 980 Liberty Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222
This conversation will explore how diaspora, migration, and cross-cultural connections shape artistic identity and serve as powerful sources of inspiration. Through their discussion, artists will consider how global Black narratives influence their work and how these stories are woven into local artistic expressions with both cultural specificity and universal resonance.

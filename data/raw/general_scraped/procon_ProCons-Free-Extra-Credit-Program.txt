Rules and Requirements
Read 10 Debates
To complete the program, you must read the following 10 ProCon debates:
Take the 10 Assessment Quizzes
After reading each debate, take the related assessment quiz. A perfect score—8 correct answers to the 8 questions in each quiz—must be achieved. The quizzes may be taken as many times as necessary to reach that score.
Once you receive a perfect score on a quiz, screenshot the final score sheet that says, “Congrats! 8/8 questions.” You will need a screenshot of all 10 perfect scores to complete the program. (Screenshotting your score is easiest on a smartphone, but for instructions on how to capture screenshots on any device, see PCMag .)
Complete the Current Affairs Program Survey
After reading the 10 debates and achieving a perfect score on the 10 related quizzes, take the required Current Affairs Program Survey to see how learning alternative views on these various issues affected your perception of these topics.
When you reach the end of the questions, check the box that says, “ Send me a copy of my responses via email .” You will need a copy of the survey to complete the program. Then click “Done.”

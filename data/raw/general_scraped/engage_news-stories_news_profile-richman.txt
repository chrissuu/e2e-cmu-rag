Through several avenues of giving, she is returning the favor.
She created an endowed scholarship with her mother, which is named after her sister, Cheryl, who attended CMU for two semesters before passing away from Crohn’s disease at age 22; contributes to another scholarship set up by her mother; and gives recurring support to the CMU Fund, which allows the university to respond nimbly to unforeseen challenges and new opportunities as they arise.
With a legacy gift in her will and estate plans, she’ll also establish the Rosalyn C. Richman Endowed Faculty Development Fund that will perpetually support professional development activities for Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences faculty, with particular emphasis on partnerships and research toward gender equity.
To fund her philanthropy, Rosalyn created multiple CMU charitable gift annuities that pay her income for the rest of her life, allowed her to claim charitable deductions for immediate tax savings and will provide permanent support to Tartans for years to come. She also took advantage of funding her annuities with a gift of appreciated stock, then deferred her income payments for a few years, both of which proved to be tax-savvy and financially advantageous strategies for her circumstances.
She focuses her giving on areas that help CMU women — undergraduate, graduate and faculty members —  to succeed on campus and in their careers, a lifelong aspiration that she says started during her studies at Margaret Morrison.
“My senior year, I took a seminar with (noted anthropologist and former CMU professor) Peggy Sanday, and it just opened my eyes and a door to a different experience,” Rosalyn says. “It was all women talking about feminist things before feminism was part of the mainstream conversation.”

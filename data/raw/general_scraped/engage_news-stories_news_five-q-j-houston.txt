Tell us about how you work with your subjects. How do you go about building trust? What does a photoshoot look like for you?
For some of the people in the book, I already had a relationship with them, and it’s been established that they want me to photograph them. Apart from that group it’s always been important to me that the person comes to me, and I don’t ask them directly. So, I’ll put out open calls or I’ll ask people if they know of friends that might be interested in participating. I think that establishes a base layer of trust, because they want to be photographed by me and to be seen.
During the shoots, I start by saying that you can do whatever you want in the photos, or if you want me to give some direction, I will. I start slow and tell people they can say no. I invite them to wear outfits they like, or if you have objects they like, we can also include those. We usually photograph in the person’s home, if we can, because I think it creates a comfort for them since it’s their space. It’s a lot of letting people go where they want to with it and less about pushing an agenda.
I also created these images with a large-format camera, which means I’m under a sheet. I think not being able to see me lets people get into their own headspace and relax some of those guards that queer people need to have to exist in the world.

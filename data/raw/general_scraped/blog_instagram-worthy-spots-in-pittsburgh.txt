Head over to the pedestrian-friendly Hot Metal Bridge just east of the city to grab a panoramic photo of the river and skyline. You might be so lucky to catch a barge passing under, too!
The bridge itself is a unique and modern landscape for passersby to grab an artsy selfie. One side of the bridge will lead you to Pittsburgh's most visited street for nightlife, while the other side will put you out on an aesthetic bike path that runs across the city.
Pro Tip: This is an active path for bikers, so be aware of your surroundings as you snap that perfect selfie.

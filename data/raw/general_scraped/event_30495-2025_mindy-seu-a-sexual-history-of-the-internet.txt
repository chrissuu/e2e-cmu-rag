A SEXUAL HISTORY OF THE INTERNET reveals the pervasive and perverted origins of our digital tools. How have technologies shaped and been shaped by sexuality? Together, we will examine the relationships between techno-development and sexuality, innovation and autonomy, lust and extraction. In this participatory lecture performance, citations are read aloud by you, the audience, through a shared script on your mobile device. It is a performance of re-citation.
This book is a history. It gathers anecdotes, artworks, and historical artifacts that reveal the pervasive and perverted origins of our digital tools.
This book is a script. It documents A SEXUAL HISTORY OF THE INTERNET, a participatory lecture performance told through the audience’s phones. It is a polyvocal story, whose citations are read aloud by the audience — performance as re-citation.
This book is an experiment. This book is a financial experiment of redistribution. In it, you’ll find citations by 45 people who shaped a new understanding of the internet, sex, and sexual technologies. When you buy this book, they will split 30% of profits through “Citational Splits” — a new model of attribution.

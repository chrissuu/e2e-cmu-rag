Office of Disability Resources
The Office of Disability Resources strives to provide responsive, reasonable accommodations to help our students accomplish their best work.
Director Catherine Samuel and the Disability Resources staff are passionate about providing vibrant and accessible resources on disability issues for all members of the CMU community . Our mission includes providing physical, digital and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the Carnegie Mellon community for students and visitors to our campus.
We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

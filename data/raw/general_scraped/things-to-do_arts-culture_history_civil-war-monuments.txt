West Park on the North Side The Hampton Battery Monument honors the Pennsylvania Independent Light Artillery, Battery F that served at Chancellorsville, Antietam, Gettysburg and other Civil War battles. Of the 80 men who were mustered into service on October 8, 1861, only 28 survived. All of the unit's first officers were killed and their names appear on the monument's pedestal: Hampton, Geary, Todd and Miller. Also on the pedestal are the names of those "who died beside their guns."

Amid throngs of sports fans donning black and gold (the official colors of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Penguins), you’ll find plenty of green. The Pittsburgh region has 15,000 acres of public parks; 400 miles of biking, hiking and walking trails; and more trees per square mile than any other U.S. city. It’s also home to one of the largest concentrations of certified “green” buildings, including the Phipps Conservatory.
Opt for an outdoor adventure and take a walk or bike ride in Point State Park, which sits at the nexus of the city’s three rivers in the heart of downtown. It serves as a waypoint for trails and bike lanes in all directions, including the Great Allegheny Passage, which goes all the way to Washington, D.C.
Get some thrills at Kennywood Park, named among the best theme parks in the nation for its old-fashioned atmosphere and first-class roller coaster scene. Or if chills are more your thing, take the bus downtown and glide on the ice at PPG Plaza’s 2,000-square-foot outdoor rink.
Or, if you just want to decompress close to campus, take a walk through Schenley Park, a 456-acre green space that’s a popular gathering spot for CMU students and home to our annual Buggy Race.

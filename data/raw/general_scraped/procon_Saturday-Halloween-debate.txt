Halloween is observed on October 31, no matter what day of the week it falls on, and it has a long history. In Europe and North America, observance of the holiday is mainly nonreligious, celebrated with parties, spooky costumes, carved jack-o’-lanterns , and the giving of candy. [27]
Although the holiday is famous for these secular traditions, it also has deep Pagan and religious roots. As Encyclopaedia Britannica explains, Halloween may have developed, at least partially, from the pre-Christian holiday Samhain , which was celebrated in early medieval Ireland around November 1 as the beginning of a new year. In ancient Celtic (Irish) religion, Samhain was “one of the most important and sinister calendar festivals of the year. At Samhain . . . the world of the gods was believed to be made visible to humankind, and the gods played many tricks on their mortal worshipers; it was a time fraught with danger, charged with fear, and full of supernatural episodes.” [41] [43]
During the Samhain festival, the souls of the dead were believed to return to visit their homes. Folks lit bonfires on hilltops to frighten away evil spirits, and they sometimes wore masks and other disguises to avoid being recognized by the visiting ghosts, giving rise to the tradition of wearing costumes on the holiday. They also carved demonic faces out of turnips to frighten away and confuse the spirits. The holiday was largely banned in the American colonies , because it was seen as a Pagan, anti-Christian holiday; some contemporary Christian groups and parents ban the holiday for the same reason. Practitioners of Wicca , the largest modern Pagan religion, continue to celebrate Samhain; many Wiccans identify as witches. [41] [43] [44]
When Irish immigrants moved to the United States in large numbers in the 19th century, they brought their holiday carving tradition with them. However, they now carved jack-o’-lanterns not out of turnips but from pumpkins, which are native to North America. The “Jack” in jack-o’-lantern, as Britannica explains, refers to Stingy Jack, who in Irish mythology “tricked the Devil for his own monetary gain. When Jack died, God refused his entrance into heaven , and the Devil didn’t allow him into hell , so Jack was sentenced to roam the earth for eternity.” Jack had only an ember from the Devil to light his way through the darkness of the world—Jack placed the ember in a carved-out turnip, creating a lantern of sorts and earning the nickname Jack of the Lantern. Scary “jack-o’lanterns” were then carved during the holiday to ward off Jack’s lingering spirit. [41] [43] [45]
The thousand-year-old history of Halloween Halloween has roots in the Celtic harvest festival of Samhain, which was observed in ancient Britain and Ireland on November 1st. (more)
Likely to counter the popularity of Halloween and its secular traditions, the Christian church moved All Saints’ Day from May 13 to November 1, perhaps in an effort to replace the Pagan holiday with a Christian celebration. The evening before All Saints’ Day therefore became a holy (“hallowed”) eve (meaning the day before something), from which the word “Halloween” derived. The holiday, then, marks the beginning of “Allhallotide,” a three-day Christian triduum (a three-day holy period) dedicated to remembering the dead that begins with All Hallows’ Eve (another name for Halloween, October 31), followed by All Saints’ Day (November 1) and All Souls’ Day (November 2). [27] [39] [40] [42]
In the United States, according to tradition, children (often accompanied by parents and pets) dress up in costumes and go door-to-door in their neighborhoods, saying “trick or treat” to receive candy; if a person doesn’t give a treat, the person may receive a “trick,” or a prank, instead. Some would like to see Halloween held on a Saturday every year to better ensure the safety of the children, so the parading children could start earlier in the day, during daylight hours, instead of early evening after school; some have even petitioned the U.S. president for the Saturday holiday via change.org. However, others point out that the federal government doesn’t have the ability to make that change because Halloween isn’t a federal holiday . [1] [2] [3]
According to the National Retail Federation, which tracks consumer habits, 73% of Americans will celebrate Halloween in 2025 (69% did so in 2022), spending $114 per person ($108 in 2023) for a total national spend of $13.1 billion ($12.2 billion in 2023). Of the $13.1 billion spent nationwide on the holiday, $4.3 billion will be spent on costumes, $4.2 billion on decorations, $3.9 billion on candy, and $0.7 billion on greeting cards. [36] [37] [38] [40]
Halloween is clearly a national phenomenon, a major contributor to the country’s culture and economy. So, given this stature, should Halloween be recognized in a special way and moved permanently to Saturday, as many advocates want? Explore the debate below.
Pro 1: Celebrating Halloween on a Saturday would make the holiday safer for children.
Fatal crashes involving children increased 83%, and those involving pedestrians increased 55%, when Halloween falls on a weeknight, after the children have returned from school. Further, there’s been an increase of at least 21 fatal crashes every time the holiday fell on a Friday since 1994. Safe Kids Worldwide states, “Twice as many kids are killed while walking on Halloween than any other day of the year.” [6] [7]
Making trick-or-treating even more dangerous, 82% of parents don’t add high visibility aids such as reflective tape or glow sticks to their kids’ costumes, and 63% of trick-or-treaters don’t carry flashlights, according to the Halloween & Costume Association, an organization that created a petition to move Halloween to Saturdays. [8]
Moving Halloween to a Saturday would allow trick-or-treating to begin in the daylight hours, reducing the risk of fatal crashes and eliminating the need for costume safety alterations and flashlights. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says fatal crashes can occur on Halloween when trick-or-treaters dart out into the street unexpectedly. Communities could create safer walking conditions on a Saturday Halloween by blocking off selected roads, which wouldn’t be practical on weeknights when people are returning home from work. [9] [10] [11]
Pro 2: Celebrating Halloween on a Saturday would be more fun and less stressful for everyone.
Instead of rushing home from school and work to fit in dinner and homework before setting out for trick-or-treating, kids and parents could enjoy the whole day and do more fun Halloween activities together on a Saturday. Entrepreneur Matt Douglas notes, “Extended family could gather like they do for other major holidays and special memories can be made.” [11] [12]
With a Saturday Halloween, people who work the traditional Monday–Friday schedule won’t miss out on the fun of handing out candy to kids in the neighborhood. The holiday would be less stressful because parents won’t have to worry about kids staying up past their bedtimes on a sugar high. Plus, businesses won’t lose the productivity of tired workers who attended Halloween parties. [11] [13]
Pro 3: Celebrating Halloween on a Saturday would minimize the holiday’s negative impact on schools and learning.
When Halloween falls on a weekday, students, especially younger ones, are too distracted to learn on the holiday. Plus, Halloween parties and parades at school exclude kids whose cultures don’t celebrate the holiday or whose parents can’t afford nice costumes, embarrassing the kids. [11] [14]
School-day Halloween celebrations, which may have sweet treats and loud music, raise potential issues for students with serious food allergies, kids on the autism spectrum, and those with anxiety. Students and even teachers sometimes cause disruptions by wearing costumes that are inappropriate or too scary. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]
Teachers also struggle to keep students focused on the day after Halloween, when they have to wrangle tired and cranky kids, who often smuggle their candy into class, creating yet another distraction. Retired teacher Cookie Knisbaum states that kids are “going to be hyped-up from the day before, and they’re going to try to bring their candy with them.” Moving Halloween to a Saturday would get the holiday out of the classroom, give kids a day to recover before school on Monday, and allow families to decide if and how they want to celebrate. [11] [20]
Con 1: Moving Halloween to Saturday would put kids on the streets on the most dangerous night of the week.
Halloween is already a dangerous holiday, with about 43% more pedestrians dying on the holiday than other autumn nights. Moving the holiday to Saturday, the most dangerous day of the week, could further increase injuries and deaths because people would start drinking alcohol earlier in the day and consume more overall than they would on a weeknight. [21]
Drunk drivers are already involved in more than 25% of pedestrian deaths on Halloween. Ensuring that Halloween always occurs on a weekend night would lead to more binge drinking and drunk driving, making pedestrians less safe. [22]
Drivers ages 15–25 are responsible for nearly a third of all child pedestrian fatal accidents on Halloween. Moving the holiday to the weekend every year would likely increase the fatalities because of later curfews and a lack of school and other responsibilities the following day. [23]
Saturdays have the most fatal car crashes of any day, with a total of 5,873 during 2017 (over 500 more than the second-highest crash day). In 2017 there were an additional 799,000 nonfatal traffic accidents on Saturdays. 53% more road deaths occur on Saturdays than on Tuesdays, the safest day of the week. [24] [25] [26]
Con 2: Moving Halloween would ignore the holiday’s ancient and religious traditions.
The origins of Halloween have religious and cultural importance, tracing back 2,000 years to the Pagan festival Samhain (pronounced “sow-in”), in which the ancient Celts celebrated the end of summer from sunset on Oct. 31 to sunset on Nov. 1. They believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to Earth, blurring the boundary between the living and dead. About 43 ce the Romans, who were then ruling the Celtic territory, combined their Feralia festival honoring the dead with the Samhain activities. [27] [28]
Since the mid-8th century, as Encyclopædia Britannica explains, the Catholic church has observed “Allhallotide, a three-day triduum dedicated to remembering the dead that begins with Halloween (October 31) and is followed by All Saints’ Day (November 1) and All Souls’ Day (November 2).” [27] [29] [39]
Con 3: Moving Halloween to Saturday would simply allow kids more time to cause trouble.
Halloween has historically always been a night of pranks. Celebrations in colonial America included “mischief-making of all kinds.” These days, kids might toss toilet paper in trees, jump out to scare people, or drink while underage. [27] [30]
Amarjeet Sidhu, a seventh grader at the time of this quote, stated, “I think that Halloween should always be celebrated on the 31st. If it is celebrated on Saturdays, kids would go out late at night and put graffiti on signs, smash pumpkins and egg houses. I know this from experience. It won’t feel right if Halloween is not on Oct. 31.” [31]
Many kids don’t realize that pranks they think of as harmless could actually get them arrested for vandalism or assault; many homeowners are also armed and could react violently to late-night, weekend pranks aimed at them or their homes. Even less serious pranks can still be subject to community service or monetary penalties. When Halloween is on a Saturday, kids are able to stay out later causing trouble. If Halloween were always on a Saturday, they could get into the annual habit of planning new and creative ways to create trouble on that special night. [30] [32]

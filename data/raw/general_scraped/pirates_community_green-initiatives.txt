When the sun comes out and the sound of cracking bats fills PNC Park, the Pirates continue to re-open the PNC Park Patio Garden. The Patio Garden uses sustainable practices and provides vegetables and herbs, grown on-site, to be used in Pirates players' favorite healthy dishes prepared by Pirates Executive Chef Tony Palatucci.
Since 2022 over 335 pounds of produce was harvested from the Patio Garden.
The Patio Garden is a part of the Pirates' commitment to sustainability through the Club's nationally recognized "Let's Go Bucs. Let's Go Green." initiative.
Not only does the garden use AgRecycle compost mix that was once PNC Park food waste, but the garden also uses recyclables collected by the Pirates to line each of the raised grow beds. In addition, rainwater is collected on the patio as the garden's primary watering source.

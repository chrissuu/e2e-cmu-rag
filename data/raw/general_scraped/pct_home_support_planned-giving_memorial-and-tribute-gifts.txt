If you have a loved one who has been impacted by The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, establishing a memorial or tribute gift is a meaningful way to honor them or celebrate a special occasion, such as a birthday, while supporting our mission. Your memorial or tribute gift will extend the legacy of your loved one and will make a difference.

2024 CMA Award winner and multi-platinum selling artist Cody Johnson is launching his Leather Deluxe Tour! The 2025 tour kicked off just a few short weeks after Cody wrapped his 2024 touring schedule in mid-December playing 30 sold-out concerts. He capped off last year with two sold-out shows in Las Vegas at the MGM Garden Arena with a surprise appearance by country music superstar Lainey Wilson.
The tour will make back-to-back stops in Nashville at Bridgestone Arena, as his last visit to the arena took place one year ago, achieving the most tickets sold by a male country artist in their Bridgestone debut. The Tennessean glowingly claimed, “Cody Johnson achieves headlining country superstardom at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena” and “Cody wears his heart on his sleeves and bears his soul for the world to witness.”
Opening acts feature Clint Black and Walker Montgomery.

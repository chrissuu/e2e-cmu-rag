Preshow Activities for Children
Children attending the Dentons Cohen & Grigsby Trust Family Series performances are invited to participate in activities before the show. Created by Trust teaching artists, the activities are age appropriate for the show, and are intended to teach, engage, and entertain young theater goers. At select performances, families also receive a book or other giveaway, while supplies last. Activities take place in the Byham lobby, beginning one hour before the start of the show.

His father’s forethought and a diligent dedication to stashing funds for a post-career life have allowed Richard to create a legacy at Carnegie Mellon University with a planned gift intention through his retirement plan.
By naming CMU as a beneficiary on his retirement plan, Richard can select and change the percentage he wishes the university to ultimately receive. He also will continue to receive regular lifetime withdrawals, too.
His support will elevate and enhance the Tartan experience for under-resourced students in Dietrich College’s Information Systems program, who are native New Yorkers like himself.
“I didn’t feel like it back then, but in retrospect, maybe I was an under-resourced student,” Richard says. “I was definitely different from 96% of the other students. I received some grants and loans, and my parents made up the difference, but I don’t know how they did it. I just know that I want other under-resourced people from New York City to have the same opportunity that I had.”
That opportunity prepared him for a successful career in information systems, which has taken him from multinational companies like Fiserv and Home Depot to public sector roles at New York City’s Department of Education and Department of Buildings, where he also contributes to a pension plan in addition to his other retirement funds.
He leaned into data modeling at Home Depot and left with enhanced data architect skills. At the Department of Education starting in 2011, he brought together disparate data systems that detailed staff, students, grading, attendance, course catalogs and more into an integrated data warehouse.

Interdisciplinary Majors
If your passions and interests are too varied to be contained by one college or program, you can pursue a major that encompasses pretty much all of them. With an interdisciplinary major, you’ll make your academic mark, and we’ll help coordinate resources across multiple colleges so you can move humankind in your own way.

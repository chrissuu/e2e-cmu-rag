We may grant placement or credit for college-level work youâ€™ve completed in high school. Have your college transcript(s) sent to the Office of Admission for transfer credit and placement evaluation. Please also send course descriptions for each course that needs to be evaluated. Credit can only be given for college-level courses that were not used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.
For engineering and science students who are awarded calculus credit, if you feel uncomfortable with the material, you can choose to take a lower level course in the sequence. Your credit will be adjusted accordingly.

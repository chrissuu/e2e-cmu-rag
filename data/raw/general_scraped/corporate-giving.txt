Programs for families and children include such favorites as the following:
Family Fun Days -- This series offers a variety of activities for families to enjoy, such as lawn games, collaborative projects and take-home artwork.  Previous programs have included the following themes:
Time Travel, during which kids add to a giant walk-through time machine and make their own prehistoric paint
Circus, with three rings of role play and the creation of costumes and critters;
Second Saturday Studios -- This family-friendly arts programming encourages children and their families to make art together.  Families with children of all ages are invited to explore different and unusual materials or find fresh new ways to use familiar paper, paint and pencils.  This free, drop-in program is held in the new Education Center.
Examples of typical programming:
Create, collect and exchange one-of-a-kind artist trading cards.
Emboss, color and shape our fancy foils.
Use a plethora of paper on a paper exploration.
Go natural using trees, leaves, and rocks for special outdoor art.

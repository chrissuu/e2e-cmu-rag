The oldest institution of higher learning in the United States is Harvard University , founded in 1636 by the Massachusetts Bay Colony to train and educate clergy. Originally called “New College,” it was renamed Harvard College in 1639 after its first major benefactor, clergyman John Harvard . Harvard is part of the elite group of eight institutions known as the Ivy League , a group noted for its high academic standards, selectivity in admissions, and social prestige. These early schools were funded by the colony or England and usually catered to a specific religious denomination, such as the Congregational or Presbyterian churches. [73]
Some early colleges, such as federal land-grant schools , had free tuition, beginning in the 1860s. Established by the 1862 Morrill Act , these schools received federally controlled land for opening “land-grant” colleges, and they were required to focus on “useful arts” like agriculture, mechanics, mining, and military instruction and thus often included “A&M” (agricultural and mechanical) in their names; the earliest A&M college, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now called Texas A&M University) opened in 1876 and was the first public institution of higher education in Texas. And some states had tuition-free policies at state colleges and universities for in-state students well into the 20th century. According to Ronald Gordon Ehrenberg, professor at Cornell University, “Public colleges and universities were often free at their founding in the United States, but over time, as public support was reduced or not increased sufficiently to compensate for their growth in students and costs (faculty and staff salaries, utilities etc.), they moved first to a low tuition and eventually higher tuition policy.” Baruch College in New York, founded in 1847 as the Free Academy and now part of the City University system of New York, was the country’s first free public college. [37] [38] [39] [70] [71] [72]
After the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, HBCUs (the Historically Black Colleges and Universities) were founded throughout the South with support from Black churches and the Freedmen’s Bureau , a federal organization that operated during the postwar Reconstruction period to help former slaves adjust to freedom; contributions from these groups kept tuition affordable. As Encyclopaedia Britannica explains, institutions such as Atlanta University (1865; now Clark Atlanta University ), Howard University , and Morehouse Colleg e (1867) provided a liberal arts education and trained students for careers as teachers, ministers, and missionaries, while others prepared students for industrial or agricultural jobs. Some institutions, such as Morehouse, were all-male schools, while others, such as Spelman College (1924; originally founded in 1881 as Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary), were all-female. Most of the schools, however, were coeducational, and HBCUs today accept white students, too. [74]
Today, college tuition is set by state policy or by each institution. Free college programs do exist, and they come in different forms but generally involve the government covering tuition costs, while students pay for other expenses, such as room and board. Free college programs exist in some form in 34 states . Additionally, over 100 colleges and universities, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard , offer free tuition to certain students regardless of state programs.

Some 62 percent of high school graduates attended college in 2025; highlighting how this number has changed over the years, only 2.9 percent of American 18- to 24-year-olds went to college in the 1909-10 school year. In spring 2024 there were more than 17.8 million college students in the United States, and borrowers nationwide owed $1.8 trillion in student debt. On average, those students paid $9,750 in tuition at 4-year in-state public schools or $28,445 at 4-year out-of-state public schools. Tuition at public four-year institutions rose 36.7 percent between 2010 and 2023, the most recent data available. When adjusted for inflation, college tuition has risen 197.4 percent since 1963. The average student loan debt was about $38,375, with students paying about $2,636 each year in interest on loans that take an average of 20 years to pay off. [55] [63] [64] [65] [75]
At the national level, free college programs have been in effect for military personnel since the 1944 G.I. Bill . At least 40 other countries have free or nearly free college tuition. [7] [8] [9] [42] [43] [44] [61]
According to the 2022 Education Next Survey of Public Opinion, 61 percent of Americans supported free four-year college and 66 percent supported free two-year college. [56]
So, should a public college education be tuition-free? Explore the debate below.
Pro 1: Tuition-free college would help decrease student debt.
If tuition were free, students would take on significantly fewer student loans. As of July 2024, student loan debt in the United States stood at $1.8 trillion. In all, some 46 million Americans have student loan debt. The average student-borrower spends more than 20 years paying off college loan debt. The vast majority of American student loans are owned by the U.S. Department of Education. [57] [69] [75] [76]
Student loan debt rose over 240 percent between 2006 and 2024. Students are coming out of college already buried under a mountain of debt before they have a chance to start their careers. [58] [59] [69]
“It is insane and counter-productive to the best interests of our country and our future, that hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college, and that millions of others leave school with a mountain of debt that burdens them for decades. That shortsighted path to the future must end,” argued Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT). [6]
Pro 2: Our society and economy have benefited from tuition-free college in the past.
Nearly half of all college students in 1947 were military veterans, thanks to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s signing of the G.I. Bill in 1944 to ensure that military service members, veterans, and their dependents could attend college tuition-free. The G.I. Bill allowed 2.2 million veterans to earn a college education and another 5.6 million to receive vocational training, all of which helped expand the middle class. An estimated 40 percent of those veterans would not have been able to attend college otherwise. Recipients of G.I. Bill benefits generated an extra $35.6 billion over 35 years and an extra $12.8 billion in tax revenue, resulting in a return of $6.90 for every dollar spent. [7] [8] [9] [10]
The beneficiaries of the free tuition contributed to the economy by buying cars and homes, and by getting jobs after college, while not being burdened by college debt. They contributed to society with higher levels of volunteering, voting, and charitable giving. [11]
The 1944 G.I. Bill paid for the educations of 22,000 dentists, 67,000 doctors, 91,000 scientists, 238,000 teachers, 240,000 accountants, 450,000 engineers, three Supreme Court justices (William Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens, and Byron R. White), three presidents (Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H.W. Bush), many members of Congress, at least one secretary of state, 14 Nobel Prize winners, at least 24 Pulitzer Prize winners, many entertainers (including Johnny Cash, Paul Newman, and Clint Eastwood), and many more.

Pro 3: Everyone deserves the opportunity to get a college education.
As argued by Jamie Merisotis, president and CEO of the Lumina Foundation, “A dramatic increase in the number of Americans with college credentials is absolutely essential for our economic, social and cultural development as a country.” [15]
The rapid rise of tuition has limited access to higher education, which is essential in today’s workforce. At least three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations now call for education beyond high school, according to the U.S. Department of Education. On average, college graduates earn $40,500 or 86 percent more than high-school graduates annually, and college graduates have lower unemployment rates. Yet, students from low- and moderate-income families are unable to afford about 95 percent of American colleges. [16] [17] [29] [30] [68]
“A century ago high school was becoming a necessity, not a luxury; today the same is happening to college,” argue Max Page and Dan Clawson of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “If college is essential for building a career and being a full participant in our democracy as high school once was, shouldn’t it be free, paid for by public dollars, and treated as a right of all members of our country?” [21]
Con 1: Tuition-free college is not free, and students would still have large debts.
Tuition is only one expense college students have to pay, accounting for only 30-75 percent of total average college costs. [60]
On average, 2024-2025 in-state tuition at a four-year public college cost $11,610 per year. Fees and room and board for on-campus housing were another $13,310. Books and supplies were another $1,290, transportation another $1,340, and other expenses another $2,360. Without tuition, college still costs an average of $18,300 per year. [66]
Tuition accounts for just under 20 percent of the average community college student’s budget, which runs $20,570 annually on average. [66]
Sweden has free college, and yet students in that country had an average of $21,000 in student debt for living costs and other expenses in 2018 (the most recent comparable data), compared with the $28,400 in debt American college students had the same year. [67]
Con 2: Taxpayers would spend billions to subsidize tuition, while other college costs would remain high.
The estimated cost of Senator Bernie Sanders’ free college program was $47 billion per year, and it had states paying 33 percent of the cost, or $15.5 billion. According to David H. Feldman and Robert B. Archibald, both professors of economics at William & Mary College, the plan would have “require[d] tax increases, or it will force states to move existing resources into higher education and away from other state priorities like health care, prisons, roads and K–12 education.” [50] [26]
According to a Campaign for Free College report, states could lose between $77 million (Wyoming) and $5 billion (California) in tuition revenue from their state colleges and universities, and they could pay an additional $15,000 (Wyoming) to $55 million (New York) to subsidize a tuition-free plan. [27]
Neal McCluskey, director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom, calculated that free college funded by tax dollars would cost every adult taxpayer $1,360 a year, or $77,500 over a lifetime. “Why should people who want to go to college get it paid for in part by people who pursue on-the-job training or other forms of noncollege education?” he asked. “Indeed, why should anyone get a degree to increase their lifetime earnings on the backs of taxpayers?” [28]
College costs have increased for a number of reasons unrelated to tuition, including the financing of fancy dorms, amenities like lazy rivers and climbing walls, student services (such as health care), athletics, increases in administrative personnel, and cuts in state funding. [31] [32] [33] [46]
Con 3: Tuition-free college attracts students who really shouldn’t be in college, wasting public money and decreasing college completion rates.
Jack A. Chambless, an economics professor at Valencia College, has argued that with a free college program, “potentially millions of young people who have no business attending college would waste their time—and taxpayer dollars—seeking degrees they will not obtain.… Free tuition would dupe young people into a sense of belonging, only to find that their work ethic, intelligence and aptitude are not up to the rigors of advanced education.” [34]
As a case in point, under California’s community college fee waiver program, more than 50 percent of the state’s community college students attended for free (before a 2017 program change), but only 6 percent of all California community college students completed a career technical program, and fewer than 10 percent completed a two-year degree in six years. [35]
“Students will enroll at a ‘free college’ and borrow money for the cost of attendance. Then, they will drop out and have a student loan—but no skills. Brilliant,” quipped Vince Norton, managing partner at Norton Norris, a campus marketing company. [36]

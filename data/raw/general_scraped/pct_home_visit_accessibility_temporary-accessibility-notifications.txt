Elevator Renovation at the Benedum Center
June 23 - November 3, 2025
As part of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience at the Benedum Center, we will be renovating the front-of-house elevator from June through September 2025. This project will expand the elevator car to accommodate more guests for daily convenience, as well as larger medical equipment in the event of a health emergency, improving accessibility and guest service for years to come.
During this time, we want to make you aware of temporary changes:
Accessible seating will continue to be available on the Orchestra Level (street level / main floor).
Access to upper and lower floors will require ascending or descending stairs (including most restrooms).
Two accessible, single-user restrooms are available on the Orchestra Level.
No elevator access will be available to our sensory room and adult changing table, located on the Promenade level.
The house right staircase to the balcony from mezzanine will not be available for use.
We understand that guests with mobility concerns seated on upper floors, not utilizing designated accessible seating, may also be affected by these temporary changes. If you have any concerns, please contact the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Guest Services team at 412-456-6666, and we will gladly assist in ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable experience.

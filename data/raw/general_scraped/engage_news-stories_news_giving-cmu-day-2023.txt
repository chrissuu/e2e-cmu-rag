On Nov. 28, 2023, 6,600 generous members of the Tartan community made this year’s Giving CMU Day the most successful one yet! With more than $650,000 in challenge and matching funds available, the impact of each gift was multiplied, and the day truly lived up to its theme of “Level Up.”
More than $2.1 million was raised to open new worlds of possibility for Carnegie Mellon’s incredible students, faculty and staff. We’re grateful that so many dedicated supporters of CMU choose to make a difference during the most philanthropic 24 hours of the year.
A total of 280 programs and initiatives at CMU — from research projects to student organizations — will begin 2024 with additional resources. For that, and so many other demonstrations of support throughout the day, we say thank you and GAME ON for another amazing year of Tartan excellence!

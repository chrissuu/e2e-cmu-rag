â€‹It's the city's biggest and arguably hippest neighborhood.
Home to many artists and designers, this trendy 'ville hosts some of the city's biggest arts events. It's a neighborhood on the rise with affordable properties, first-rate, one-of-a-kind shops and an awesome dining scene. The neighborhood has undergone such a revival that it's called a "go-to" destination by The New York Times. Located less than three miles from Downtown, it's a neighborhood with deep roots too. In fact, composer Stephen Foster's father charted the street plans in 1814.

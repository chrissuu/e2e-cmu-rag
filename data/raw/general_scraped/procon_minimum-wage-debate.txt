The first federal minimum wage was introduced in 1938 during the Great Depression under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), itself part of Roosevelt’s larger New Deal package of measures to battle the Depression. The first federal minimum wage was set at $0.25 per hour. The federal minimum wage has been increased by Congress 22 times, most recently in 2009 from $6.55 to $7.25 an hour. Most states plus D.C. have a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage, though several states do not have minimum wage laws (which means workers in those states default to the federal minimum wage).

Early History of the Minimum Wage

In 1890 the annual wages of the average American were $380, well below the poverty line of $500 per year. Progressivism , a social and political reform movement, emerged at this time with the aim of improving American working conditions and wages. Following the example of Australia and New Zealand , which enacted the world’s first minimum wage laws in the 1890s, the Progressives introduced the idea of a U.S minimum wage, arguing that it should be high enough to support an average employee’s needs. [95] [96] [97] [98]
While men generally earned higher wages, enjoyed freedom of contract, and could join and rely on the protection of unions, women and minors were not afforded such luxuries. Barred from joining unions and prevented from the free negotiation of contracts, they suffered from low wages and poor working conditions, which drove women to prostitution to cover their costs of living. It was thought that a minimum wage would give these especially vulnerable groups a level of protection not needed by the male workforce. [142] [176]
As a direct result of pressure from the Progressive movement, the first state minimum wage laws were introduced, exclusively for women and minors—the first one was established in Massachusetts in 1912. Between 1913 and 1917, 11 more states enacted minimum wage laws for women and minors. [99]
The Oregon minimum wage legislation of 1913 stated, “the State of Oregon requires that women and minors should be protected from conditions of labor which have a pernicious effect on their health and morals, and inadequate wages and unduly long hours and unsanitary conditions of labor have such a pernicious effect.” This law instituted a weekly state minimum wage of $8.25 for experienced women, $6 for inexperienced women and girls aged 16-18, and higher rates for employees in Portland. [143]
In 1937 Oklahoma became the first state to enact minimum wage legislation covering men. These provisions were deemed void by the state’s 1939 Supreme Court ruling in Oklahoma v. Industrial Welfare Commission ; however, this was due to the language used in the law, not the concept of a minimum wage for men. [99] [112]
In 1939 the Women’s Party of Connecticut argued that, while the minimum wage law covering women and minors was designed to protect them, it actually harmed them, because the conditions placed on their employment made them less employable than men. Their challenge resulted in a 1939 amendment to the Connecticut law that extended minimum wage provisions to men and set a precedent for other states to follow. [144]
The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), passed by Congress and signed by President Roosevelt in 1933, was the first piece of legislation that attempted to establish a federal minimum wage. However, the NIRA was declared an “unconstitutional delegation of legislative power” by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1935 in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. et al v. United States . [109] [110]
However, elements of the NIRA, such as minimum wage and maximum hour provisions, were carried over into future legislative acts. The Public Contracts Act (PCA) of 1936 covered workers employed in the manufacture of goods under government contracts worth in excess of $10,000. The PCA stipulated a minimum wage based on locally prevailing rates, an eight-hour work day, 40-hour work week, and a ban on the employment of minors. [99] [111]
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 set a national minimum wage of $0.25 an hour, a 44-hour work week, and the prohibition of “oppressive” child labor. At that time, the FLSA covered employees engaged in interstate commerce and those working in industries that produced goods for interstate commerce. [113] [114]
Early Supreme Court Decisions on the Minimum Wage
Stettler v. O’Hara (1917) was the first case brought before the U.S. Supreme Court that challenged the constitutionality of minimum wage laws. An evenly divided court (4-4) upheld the state of Oregon’s minimum wage law. Following the success of this case, three more states and D.C. passed minimum wage laws between 1918 and 1923. [99] [102]
In 1923 the U.S. Supreme Court in Adkins v. Children’s Hospital determined (5-3) that D.C.’s law was unconstitutional and “an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in a free land.” By December 1932, minimum wage laws in six states had been repealed or deemed unconstitutional. [99] [103] [104] [105]
In March 1937 the constitutionality of state minimum wage laws was again debated in the U.S. Supreme Court in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish . The Supreme Court overturned (5-4) its prior anti-minimum wage ruling in Adkins by declaring that “the legislature has necessarily a wide field of discretion in order that there may be suitable protection of health and safety, and that peace and good order may be promoted through regulations designed to insure wholesome conditions of work and freedom from oppression.” By mid-1941, 26 states, D.C., and Alaska (still a territory at this time) had minimum wage laws. [99] [115] [116] [117]
In 1940 the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of federal minimum wage provisions within the Public Contracts Act (PCA) in case of Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co . The PCA is still in force today with the minimum wage provisions tied to the federal minimum wage as set by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). [118]
In 1941 the constitutionality of the FLSA was upheld by the Supreme Court in the United States v. Darby , in which the court ruled unanimously that the “wage and hour provisions of the Act do not violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment” and that the “statute is not objectionable because [it is] applied alike to both men and women.” [114]
State Minimum Wage Levels and Restrictions
As of January 1, 2025, 45 states plus D.C. and all five inhabited U.S. territories had their own minimum wage laws in place. Twenty-nine of those states, D.C., and three territories had minimum wages higher than that of the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour—the highest being D.C. at $17.50 an hour. When a state minimum wage is set at a higher rate than the federal minimum wage, the highest rate prevails. Thirteen states and the Northern Mariana Islands set their minimum wage in line with the federal minimum wage; and two states— Georgia and Wyoming —set their rates lower at $5.15 an hour. However, Georgia and Wyoming must pay the federal minimum wage to those employed in positions covered by the FLSA (meaning employees engaged in interstate commerce and those working in industries that produced goods for interstate commerce). Only workers employed in positions not covered by the FLSA, such as outside salespersons and certain domestic service workers providing companionship services, may be paid $5.15 an hour. Five states— Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi , South Carolina , and Tennessee —do not have minimum wage legislation on their statute books and as such are required to pay workers covered by the FLSA a minimum of $7.25 an hour. [85] [117] [120]
Many cities and counties now have minimum wages higher than their state-mandated minimum. As of January 1, 2025, the five cities paying the highest minimum wage were all in the state of Washington : Burien ($21.16 per hour), Tukwila ($21.10 per hour for large employers and $20.10 for mid-sized employers), Renton ($20.90 per hour for large employers and $18.90 per hour for mid-sized employers), Seattle ($20.76 per hour), and SeaTac ($20.17 per hour). When a city or county minimum wage is set higher than its respective state and the federal minimum wage, the highest rate prevails. [136] [208]
Many states also have laws prohibiting cities and counties from setting their own minimum wage levels. [167]
Proposals to Raise the Federal Minimum Wage
Since the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 raised the federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour starting in 2009, there have been numerous unsuccessful attempts by the U.S. Congress to raise the wage further. The two main efforts are the Harkin-Miller proposal to raise the wage to $10.10 and the Living Wage Movement to raise the wage to $15. [150] [151] [153] [154] [156]
U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) and U.S. Representative George Miller (D-CA) introduced legislation in 2012, 2013, and 2014 to raise the minimum wage, but none of those efforts passed. When their proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 was re-introduced for a third time in 2014 under the Minimum Wage Fairness Act , it was supported by President Obama . However, the bill failed by four votes to overcome a Republican-led filibuster in the Senate on April 30, 2014. [150] [151] [153] [154] [156] [168] [169]
On January 14, 2021, President Joe Biden included a $15 minimum wage in the America Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 (coronavirus) rescue package. The Senate Parliamentarian ruled that the measure could not be included. As a result, Biden signed an executive order on April 27 that increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.75 for 2025, with annual adjustments to account for inflation. President Trump , however, rescinded Biden’s executive order in March 2025, thus resetting the minimum wage to $13.30 per hour for federal contractors. [191] [192] [193] [209]
While generally considered a progressive plight, a few Republicans have also made efforts to raise the federal minimum wage. In September 2023, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced the “ Higher Wages for American Workers Act of 2023 ” that would have increased the federal minimum wage to $11 over five years. The bill did not make it out of committee. In June 2025, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced the “ Higher Wages for American Workers Act of 2025 ” that proposed to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 on January 1 following the law’s enactment (should it be passed) and to automatically increase the minimum wage on September 30 of each year to stay in line with inflation. [214]
Who Earns the Federal Minimum Wage?
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 81,000 workers earned the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour and about 789,000 workers earned below the federal minimum wage in 2023, representing 1.1 percent of all hourly workers. [210]
Those earning the minimum wage and lower are mostly:

Public Opinion
Public support for raising the minimum wage has been around or over 70 percent as far back as 1994. [93]
A 2013 Gallup poll found that 50 percent of small business owners were opposed to raising the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour and 60 percent believed such an increase would hurt most small business owners. A 2015 poll by the Wall Street Journal and Vistage International found that 49 percent of small business owners favored raising the minimum wage while 49 percent were opposed. [50] [178]
A May 2015 poll conducted by CBS and the New York Times found that 86 percent of Democrats, 50 percent of Republicans, and 76 percent of independents were in favor of raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, and 67 percent of men and 75 percent of women were in favor. [91]
A 2017 poll by the University of Maryland and Voice of the People found that 73.8 percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour, while 56.8 percent support raising it to $10.10 an hour. A 2017 Quinnipiac University poll found that 54 percent of Americans would support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour with 44 percent opposing. [184] [185]
A July 30, 2019, poll found 67 percent of Americans supported raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. An April 22, 2021, poll reported similar support at 62 percent. By December 2, 2022, support for raising the federal minimum wage was up to 70 percent, with American adults reporting that the federal rate was “not sustainable to live on for any period of time.” [194] [195] [196]
An August 7, 2023, Payscale poll found that 75 percent of HR professionals and others who set wages at companies believed that the minimum wage should be increased, and 66 percent believe it should increase automatically annually. The same survey found that 68 percent of companies covered minimum wage hikes by setting their base pay above the new minimum wage. [213]
A majority of small business owners (61 percent) supported raising the minimum wage according to a January-February 2024 poll, even though 50 percent also believed raising wages could make affording their workers difficult, and only 19 percent believed a higher wage would help their businesses. [212]
A June 3, 2025, analysis of the November 2024 election found that 67 percent of working-class voters and 58 percent of college-educated ones supported a minimum wage increase to $17 an hour. [211]

Pro 1: Raising the minimum wage helps workers to afford basic living expenses and reduces income, gender, and racial inequalities.
The current minimum wage is not high enough to allow people to afford housing. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “In 2022, a full-time worker needs to earn an hourly wage of $25.82 on average to afford a modest, two-bedroom rental home in the U.S. This… is $18.57 higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25…. A full-time worker needs to earn an hourly wage of $21.25 on average in order to afford a modest one-bedroom rental home in the U.S.” [198]
Further, 35 percent of families with full-time year-round employment do not earn enough to pay for essentials including food and childcare. 59 percent of Hispanic families, 52 percent of Black families, 25 percent of white families, and 23 percent of Asian families that work full-time year-round cannot cover basic needs. Overall, families would need to earn $11 more an hour to cover basic costs, with Black and Hispanic families needing $12 more an hour. [199]
Approximately 91 percent of workers who would benefit from a raised minimum wage are over 20 years old, with 68 percent over the age of 25. Most are the primary wage earners for their families, averaging about 52 percent of their family’s income, and most are women and people of color. The current federal minimum wage prevents these individuals and families from meeting basic needs like shelter and food, as well as creating significant obstacles to healthcare, finances for an emergency, and other expenses such as car upkeep. [201]
Thus, the unaffordability of basic needs drives income, gender, and racial inequality. Workers who have to pinch pennies do not have the money, time, or other resources to invest in more education or job training for themselves and their families, meaning they remain stuck in low-paying jobs with few to no benefits such as sick days, health insurance, or retirement plans. Minimum wage workers are then also subjected to irregular schedules that can make the rest of life, such as picking up kids from school, difficult or impossible. [199] [200] [201] [205]
Increasing the minimum wage would not only bring relief to workers struggling to make ends meet, it would also raise the incomes of people who make slightly more than minimum wage. The Brookings Institution found that increasing the minimum wage would result in higher wages for the 3.7 million people earning minimum wage and up to 35 million workers who make up to 150 percent of the federal minimum wage. [28]
The White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) found that an increase to just $10.10 an hour would raise wages for 28 million Americans—about nine million of those due to the ripple effect. [29]
Pro 2: Raising the minimum wage to match inflation and productivity benefits the economy, spurring consumer activity, job growth, and a lower federal deficit.
Because the federal minimum wage is not indexed for inflation, its purchasing power (the number of goods that can be bought with a unit of currency) has dropped considerably, hitting the lowest mark since 1956. [14] [15] [16] [204]
As journalist Megan Cerullo summarizes, “The federal minimum wage of $7.25 buys less today than it has at any point over the past 66 years…. The current value of the minimum wage in real dollars is at its lowest level since February 1956, when the lowest U.S. wage was 75 cents — the equivalent of $7.19 in June 2022 dollars.” Raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation would ensure that low-wage workers could adopt a standard of living commensurate with the current economy. [204]
Further, while the estimates of how much the minimum wage should be increased vary, many economists agree that if the wage had kept pace with rising productivity and incomes, it would be higher than the current $7.25 an hour. [14] [17] [18]
If the minimum wage matched inflation as well as worker productivity and other incomes, worker productivity would increase while employee turnover decreased. Alan Manning, Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics, explains, “As the minimum wage rises and work becomes more attractive, labor turnover rates and absenteeism tend to decline.” [30] [31] [32] [33]
In turn, economic activity would increase, spurring job growth. The Economic Policy Institute stated that a minimum wage increase from the current rate of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 would inject $22.1 billion net into the economy and create about 85,000 new jobs over a three-year phase-in period. And economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago predicted that a $1.75 rise in the federal minimum wage would increase aggregate household spending by $48 billion the following year, thus boosting GDP and leading to job growth. [1] [2]
With an economic boom and more securely employed workers, the federal deficit would decrease. According to James K. Galbraith, Professor of Government at the University of Texas in Austin, “[b]ecause payroll- and income-tax revenues would rise [as a result of an increase in the minimum wage], the federal deficit would come down.” [43]
Further, raising the minimum wage would help reduce the federal budget deficit “by lowering spending on public assistance programs and increasing tax revenue. Since firms are allowed to pay poverty-level wages to 3.6 million people—5 percent of the workforce—these workers must rely on Federal income support programs. This means that taxpayers have been subsidizing businesses, whose profits have risen to record levels over the past 30 years,” according to Aaron Pacitti, Associate Professor of Economics at Siena College. [42]
Pro 3: Raising the minimum wage has social benefits including reducing poverty and crime and improving school attendance and family health.
A 2022 Urban Institute study found that “increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would lift 7.6 million people in the United States out of poverty.” A higher minimum wage would also reduce government welfare spending. If low-income workers earned more money, their dependence on, and eligibility for, government benefits would decrease. The Economic Policy Institute determined that by increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, more than 1.7 million Americans would no longer be dependent on government assistance programs. They report the increase would shave $7.6 billion off annual government spending on income-support programs. [10] [206]
Raising the minimum wage also lifts children out of poverty, increasing their school attendance and decreasing dropout rates. One study found that raising the California minimum wage to $13 an hour would increase the incomes of 7.5 million families, meaning fewer would live in poverty. Teens who live in poverty are twice as likely to miss three or more days of school per month. The study found that “recent experimental studies show that increasing income can improve school performance.” Increasing the minimum wage would also allow teens to work fewer hours for the same amount of pay, giving them more time to study and reducing the likelihood that they would drop out of high school. Alex Smith, Assistant Professor of Economics at the United States Military Academy at West Point, found that “an increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 (39 percent)… would lead to a 2-4 percentage point decrease in the likelihood that a low-SES [socio-economic status] teen will drop out.” [38] [41]
Raising the minimum wage would lead to a healthier population and prevent premature deaths. California study found that those earning a higher minimum wage would have enough to eat, be more likely to exercise, less likely to smoke, suffer from fewer emotional and psychological problems, and even prevent 389 premature deaths a year. [38]
Because minimum wage workers are more likely to report poor health, suffer from chronic diseases, and be unable to afford balanced meals, “policies that reduce poverty and raise the wages of low-income people can be expected to significantly improve overall health and reduce health inequities.” [38] [39]
A society with less poverty, fewer school attendance and health issues, and a higher minimum wage correlates to lower crime rates. According to one study, “higher wages for low-income individuals reduce crime by providing viable and sustainable employment . . . raising the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 would result in a 3 to 5 percent crime decrease (250,000 to 540,000 crimes) and a societal benefit of $8 to $17 billion dollars.” A study of crime rates and the minimum wage in New York City over a 25-year period found that “increases in the real minimum wage are found to significantly reduce robberies and murders . . . a 10 percent increase in the real minimum wage results in a 6.3 to 6.9 percent decrease in murders” and a 3.4 to 3.7 percent decrease in robberies.

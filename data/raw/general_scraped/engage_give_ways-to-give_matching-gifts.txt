Increase the Impact of Your Gift
Many companies sponsor matching gift programs and will match contributions made to CMU by their employees. Some companies also may match gifts made by retirees, board members and/or spouses or partners.
If your employer offers a matching gift program, please request a matching gift form from your employer and send it, completed and signed, with or following your gift to:
Carnegie Mellon University PO Box 371525 Pittsburgh, PA 15251-7525
If your employer uses an online matching gift site, please send your gift to us and visit the company's website to request that a matching gift be made.

Entrepreneurial Education
Amanda grew up in a “tech-obsessed” family. Her dad loved computers and worked at IBM, so she always had access to the latest technology.
“We were the kids on the block with the internet connection,” Amanda says. “We were the first ones on the Prodigy computer. We had Palm Pilots. It was always like that.”
When applying for college, she looked for schools with a strong technology curriculum and a competitive volleyball program. Carnegie Mellon offered both.
When she wasn’t on the court, she was in the classroom learning valuable technical skills.
“CMU had a really good mix of theoretical foundation and pragmatic, practical skills, which  I still use today,” Amanda says. “They did a good job of teaching us about new, cutting-edge technology and also skills like HTML and CSS.”
Amanda used many of those lessons when building her app.
“Half our app was built in HTML and CSS,” she says. “Without the tactical education and being taught how to do that stuff, I would not have felt comfortable doing so much of the development myself.”
As part of her major, Amanda also took lots of business courses.
“A lot of the classes and group projects emulated what it's like to be a founding team at a startup,” she says. “The curriculum was really spot on for preparing me for entrepreneurship.”
After graduating from Carnegie Mellon, she attended business school at Stanford University, where the idea for The League was born. She received her MBA from Stanford in 2014, and The League was incorporated later that year.

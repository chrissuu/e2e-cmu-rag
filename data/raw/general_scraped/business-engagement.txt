From the technology that powers your smartphone to the entertainment you consume, Carnegie Mellon University is transforming the modern world.
Since its founding by industrialist Andrew Carnegie, CMU has been where ideas become innovations, academia partners with industry, and problems find real-world solutions. You’d expect nothing less from the birthplace of AI, the university that reinvented business education, the leading pioneer in advanced manufacturing and the first degree-granting program in drama.
Here, the world’s best researchers, students and faculty engage in boundary breaking cross-disciplinary collaboration, both internally and externally, that bring new products to market, move industries forward, prepare workers for the challenges of tomorrow and create new fields of discovery. A connection to the CMU community has been the key advantage for many startups, tech firms, manufacturers, financial institutions and more.

Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory.
Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes.
A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the "pre-show". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the "play-by-play".
Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 213. Tickets are $14.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship.
To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby.

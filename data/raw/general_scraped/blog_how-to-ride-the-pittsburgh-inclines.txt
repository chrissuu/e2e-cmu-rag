The inclines are public transportation, so Pittsburgh Regional Transit Connect Cards work to pay for a trip as well. If you don't have a Connect Card, the Mon Incline will accept credit cards, but the Duquesne Incline is exact cash only.
Pro Tip: Use the PRT App on your smartphone to buy your Incline tickets. On the App, tickets are $2.75 and valid for unlimited trips for 3 hours total on both Inclines.

In partnership with The Westmoreland Museum of American Art and Fallingwater, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust presents an exhibition highlighting Frank Lloyd Wright’s unrealized projects for Downtown Pittsburgh. The exhibition will feature animated videos created by Skyline Ink Animators + Illustrators and models of unrealized residential, commercial, and civic projects designed by Frank Lloyd Wright from the 1930s through the 1950s. These projects include a monumental reimagining of the Point (1947), a self-service garage for Kaufmann’s Department Store (1949), and the Point View Residences, designed for the Edgar J. Kaufmann Charitable Trust (1952).
The exhibition is curated by Scott W. Perkins, Senior Director of Preservation and Collections, Fallingwater.
Frank Lloyd Wright’s Southwestern Pennsylvania is co-organized by The Westmoreland Museum of American Art and Fallingwater, a property entrusted to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy. It is presented at 820 Gallery by The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.
This exhibition is generously supported by The Heinz Endowments, The Hillman Exhibition Fund of The Westmoreland Museum of American Art, and Wendy and David Barensfeld.

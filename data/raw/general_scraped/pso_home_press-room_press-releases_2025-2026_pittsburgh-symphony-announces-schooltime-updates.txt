PITTSBURGH, PA—Today, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) announced the 25/26
Schooltime season alongside recent successes of the series, celebrating significant growth in the
24/25 season with an 8.5% increase in participating districts and a 5.6% rise in schools. The PSO
has set a goal of reaching 100% of Allegheny County school districts, beginning by introducing a
new bus fund for schools with low-income enrollment.
Schooltime is a beloved Pittsburgh tradition that brings K–12 students into the world of
orchestral music—free for all schools, in person and online. Throughout the 24/25 season,
Schooltime uses music to explore what it means to be American in programs featuring works
like Peter Boyer’s multimedia Ellis Island: The Dream of America, and Pittsburgh native Hannah
Ishizaki’s City of Bridges.
In the 25/26 season, Schooltime will explore what American music is, including an “All-
American Edition” of the popular Meet the Orchestra program and an open call for music scores
from Pennsylvania composers. Registration for the 25/26 Schooltime season will be available
starting on Friday, August 1 at www.pittsburghsymphony.org/schooltime.
“Our Learning & Engagement programs exemplify our vision of bringing great music into every
life,” said Melia Tourangeau, President & CEO. “Expanding access to music and music
learning has been a consistent mission of these programs, which reached over 30,000 students
last season. We’re forging ahead with that commitment by setting an audacious goal of reaching
all Allegheny County school districts through Schooltime in the coming years and expanding the
PSO’s impact on music learning in the region.”
“Through the new bus fund, we’re looking to overcome a significant barrier to the program—the
cost of bussing students to Heinz Hall—with priority to low-income schools,” said Suzanne
Perrino, Senior Vice President of Learning & Engagement. “This is a continuation of
significant efforts to remove barriers and increase access to music learning. In 24/25, we
launched Digital Schooltime and Schooltime on the Road; in 25/26 we’ll add new content to
Digital Schooltime and visit two new counties, Washington and Indiana. In addition to the
variety of regular Sensory Friendly accommodations at all Schooltime concerts, we’ve also
committed to offering ASL interpretation at one concert in each series. I’m excited to see the
growth from our efforts and to continue to work for increased access to our music learning
programs.”

24/25 Schooltime Series Success
Over the 24/25 school year, Schooltime reached 22,041 students from 169 schools in
Southwestern PA, and a handful of schools from Ohio (two counties), exceeding pre-pandemic
attendance levels. The program reached all school types: public, private, charter, cyber, and
homeschool, across 16 counties.
Schooltime Growth Year-Over-Year
23/24 24/25 % change
All school districts 47 51 +8.5%
All public schools 127 137 +7.8%
All schools (public/private/charter) 160 169 +5.6%
TOTAL ATTENDANCE 21,568 22,041 +2.2%

25/26 Expansion and Future Goals
The PSO is setting higher goals for Schooltime to build on recent success and increase the
Pittsburgh region’s access to music education. They include an ambitious campaign to reach all
Allegheny County school districts and to preserve the current Pittsburgh Public Schools
participation of 100% among K-5 grades.
To help meet these goals, effective during the 25/26 season, the PSO will be making new
funding available to schools with significant low-income student populations (defined as districts
with a low-income enrollment above the Allegheny County median of 42%) to cover the cost of
roundtrip bus transportation to attend Schooltime concerts at Heinz Hall. This marks the first
time bus funding is available to schools beyond Pittsburgh Public Schools, and more than double
the funding that was available in the 24/25 season.
Schools can request transportation funding through the registration process. Funding will be
available on a first-come, first-served basis until the bus transportation fund is fully utilized. The
PSO will also continue to provide bus funding for all Pittsburgh Public School (PPS) schools to
attend the PPS Meet the Orchestra Day in May. This annual event brings all PPS second-grade
students to Heinz Hall and is part of a long-term partnership between the PSO and PPS to
promote curiosity about the orchestra and spur interest in studying a musical instrument.

Pennsylvania Composers Open Call for Scores
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is hosting an open call for scores for its 25/26 Schooltime at
Heinz Hall series from composers currently living or studying in Pennsylvania. The composer
chosen will be awarded a $1,000 prize, along with travel and accommodations to hear their piece
performed by the PSO during Schooltime concerts at Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh March 18-20,

Retail + Small Business Resources
The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership coordinates the Small Business Spotlight program to engage with patrons and create strategic initiatives that support, strengthen, and further develop small businesses in Downtown Pittsburgh. The Small Business Spotlight focuses on outreach and partnership opportunities for Downtown businesses, which will also include opportunities to participate in Downtown events and programming in an effort to increase awareness of their business, provide unique sales opportunities, and more effectively engage Downtown patrons.
Outreach
As part of the outreach, Downtown businesses are encouraged to sign-up for the In the Know e-newsletter which includes information on upcoming partnership opportunities, available workshops and resources, and logistic information such as construction and event road closures.

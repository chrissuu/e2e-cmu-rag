Pittburgh's food scene is varied and delicious, with international flavors and neighborhoods filled with top-rated restaurants and multiple James Beard Award nominees. Our beer scene isn't bad either, and we were ranked the best city for suds in 2022.
Downtown Pittsburgh alone has hundreds of dining establishments that can satisfy every craving. The hub of most downtown activity lies in Market Square , where you'll find City Works . With more than 15 flat screen TVâ€™s, 30+ local breweries featured and an energetic, lively atmosphere, City Works provides the ultimate sports bar experience.
But if you had something else in mind, take a walk on Penn Avenue and stop into the dozens of restaurants that line the street, including The Eagle or Sienna Mercato. You also don't want to miss The Standard Market & Pint House , which offers great grub, a self serve beer wall (yes, you read that right) and vintage arcade games.

2023 Founders Medal
This year’s Founders Medal for Outstanding Service and Exceptional Achievement recipient is familiar to many at Carnegie Mellon, having been a member of the community since 1960: Emeritus Professor of Design Joseph Ballay .
“Throughout his career at Carnegie Mellon University, Joe pioneered design thinking and, along the way, managed to revolutionize how the world collaborates and deliberates,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian. “His novel approach to problem-solving — which embraces the Tartan ethos of leveraging both the arts and technology to maximize progress — has shaped everything from how we explore complex societal challenges to how we interpret everyday life. For this work and his lifelong contributions to our university community and to society at large, Carnegie Mellon is thrilled to honor Joe with the CMU Founders Medal.”
As an international advocate for the importance of design in everyday life, Ballay has spent more than six decades developing his interdisciplinary vision of design as a fundamental human activity.
A 1960 Carnegie Tech bachelor of science graduate, Ballay assumed the helm of the Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts' newly created Department of Design in 1970, developing and elevating it to the status of a school within the college that it enjoys today.
Recognizing the need for practical applications of design, Ballay joined with two CMU colleagues in 1989 to form MAYA Design, an interdisciplinary design consultancy that applies theory and practice to complex contemporary problems. MAYA became the focus of his professional practice, transforming into a “technology design lab,” cultivating four additional companies and growing to employ more than 50 people.
In 2022, Ballay and his wife, Sue, established the Ballay Center for Design Fusion through a generous $10 million gift. The center, a culmination of his life’s work, establishes a formal presence of design expertise and outreach at CMU.

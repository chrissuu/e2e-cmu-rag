Carnegie Mellon University alumna Belinda Lau is giving people something to smile about.
Belinda is the co-founder and chief executive officer of ELIMS , a sustainable oral care company that makes clinically backed, 100% recyclable toothbrushes, toothpastes and teeth whitening masks.
The company’s mission — to make a positive impact on people’s health and help the planet by reducing plastic waste — is personal to Belinda. She spent part of her childhood living in Myanmar in Southeast Asia, where landfills were prevalent.
“I remember seeing so much trash in the ditches and on the streets,” says Belinda, a 2004 College of Engineering graduate with bachelor’s degrees in biomedical engineering and materials science engineering. “I had relatives living in some of these landfill areas, and it was just so heartbreaking to see.”
After graduating from CMU, Belinda spent 15 years working at Medtronic, one of the world’s largest medical device companies. While there, she realized how much waste is produced by the healthcare industry and began thinking about a solution.
“In healthcare, all of these sterile products come in individual packaging and the packaging is used one time and then thrown away,” Belinda says. “I always thought, ‘Why can't you use more sustainable materials for the packaging? They do have to be technically functional, but why can't we make it more sustainable and use more bio-based material?’”
She questioned the same thing at home, where her three children were flossing with single-use products every day.
“They've never had a cavity, but at the same time you feel so horrible. You know this product is just a one-time use for a couple of seconds and then it goes into the trash,” Belinda says.

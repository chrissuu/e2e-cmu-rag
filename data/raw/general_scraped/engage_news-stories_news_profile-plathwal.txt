From Knowledge Producer to Knowledge Broker
Priyank’s more than halfway through his two-year appointment that began in September 2022. He was one of only 44 young professionals from nearly 10,000 applicants across 189 countries to be selected for the prestigious program.
He serves in the Energy and Extractives global team, focusing on restructuring energy sectors in low-and-middle income countries with an emphasis on decarbonization, renewables and energy efficiency. His expertise lies in hard-to-abate sectors, which have no clear solutions to decarbonization.
The work aligns perfectly with his academic background and professional interests.
“I’ve ended up working on the areas where I was very well trained from my Ph.D. and postdoctoral years,” says Priyank, who received a master’s degree and Ph.D. from the College of Engineering’s Department of Engineering and Public Policy in 2021 and completed a postdoctoral research fellowship in climate policy at Harvard Kennedy School in 2022.
The first year of his appointment was rewarding, but it did come with challenges. He had to transition from a research-heavy academic setting to a more hands-on, decision-making role.
“The transition from academia to the bank means that I am no longer only a knowledge producer but more importantly, also a knowledge broker,” Priyank says.

What's with the name? Well, the Barrel refers to the brews and Flow references the performing artists and speakers. Together, Barrel & Flow represents what attendees can expect at the event: one-of-a-kind brews fresh from the barrel accompanied by live art, food vendors and entertainment all day.
This year, festivities will take place at The Stacks at 3 Crossings in the Strip District , where festival goers can enjoy exclusive craft brew collaborations, a uniquely curated collection of vendors, live music and entertainment, networking opportunities and plenty of fun. The festival is open from noon-9 p.m. Saturday for general admission and will feature more than 150 vendors.

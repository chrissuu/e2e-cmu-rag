Project Migration
After her residence program, Missy was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship. She traveled to Turkey to study Anatolian textiles, which are woven rugs and fabrics from the Anatolian Peninsula that feature vibrant colors and abstract designs. From there, she spent five years traveling the world and sketching, eventually turning those sketches into a book, “The Traveling Artist: A Visual Journal.”
She also never gave up on the idea of painting Shakespeare’s birds.
“I thought when I have the time, when I'm no longer traveling, I'm going to come back to the birds of Shakespeare,” Missy says. “And then COVID gave me that opportunity. So I thought, now's the moment. And what would be the obvious, natural progression of the project? Instead of one feather for each bird, I would do one painting for each bird.”
After starting the collection, Missy realized she needed help to see it through.
“I discovered very quickly that I was in out of my depth and this project was getting huge,” she says. “I didn't have enough knowledge to really do the project justice and make it as strong as I wanted.”
She began emailing scholars around the world to see if anyone was interested in helping. That led her back to Witmore and the Folger Institute , which granted her an artistic research fellowship to develop the project.
Missy now collaborates with a Shakespeare scholar, an avian ecologist and a botanist on every painting to ensure her depictions are as realistic and as accurate as possible. She has painted 25 out of 64 birds to date.

When I first heard about Art All Night , I was wary. A completely free art show without censorship seemed way too ambitious to live up to the hype. After attending the event for the first time in 2010, it has since become one of my must-do events in Pittsburgh every year!
One of the few fully uncensored art shows, Art All Night showcases an expansive variety of art. From traditional pieces and Pittsburgh photography to art created in front of your eyes at the event and interactive pieces, Art All Night pays homage to the past, present and future of artistic expression.
Not limited to visual art, the show also features top-notch performing arts throughout the event. Previous events featured the works across mediums of more than 500 participants!
Not only is the art impressive, the venue also adds to the artistic, grassroots atmosphere. Art All Night has taken place in unique industrial and artistic backdrops at trendy neighborhoods around the city, and currently takes place at the Crucible Building in the Strip District.
Even the weekend's production is unique. The event is fully produced by an all-volunteer committee and continues to grow each year. The Saturday morning of the event, an army of volunteers spends the hours before the event's start time arranging the art and getting the unique venue ready.

Headed out for a beer-filled day? Be sure to remember these tips to make the most of your festival experience!
Don’t forget to eat Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach is never a good idea! Stay hydrated Even though these festivals are taking place in the fall, it can still be hot and humid in Pittsburgh. Hydration can lead to serious health issues, so make sure to drink lots of water throughout the day!
Try something new We all have our go-to drinks and favorite types of beers, but don’t forget to have an open mind while attending these festivals. This is your chance to try all new types of beers. You never know what your next new favorite can be!
Plan a ride home Finding a parking spot can be a challenge, and you certainly shouldn’t plan on driving after a day of drinking. Make sure to have a ride scheduled in advance to get home safely.
Pace yourself and HAVE FUN! Beer festivals are exciting and filled with plenty of diverse beverages to drink. Know your limit, and make sure you pace yourself, in addition to drinking water and eating food, throughout the day. Most importantly, remember to have fun and look out for you and your crew.

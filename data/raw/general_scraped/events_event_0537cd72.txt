Tate McRae: Miss Possessive Tour

PPG Paints Arena 1001 Fifth Ave. Pittsburgh, PA 15219
The Miss Possessive Tour is the fifth concert tour and first arena tour by Canadian singer Tate McRae!
The tour supports Tate’s third studio album So Close To What via RCA Records. So Close To What represents the insurmountable moments in life, where the road ahead at times can feel endless and the destination non-existent. It’s an introspective exploration of self-discovery, love, and nostalgia. The album and its songs navigate the raw emotions of healing an old heart and the hesitations that come with falling in love again, the beautiful and sometimes harsh realities of what it means to be a woman and embracing a newfound confidence. Wrapped in irresistible pop production and unfiltered lyricism, So Close To What is written and produced with hitmakers Ryan Tedder, Grant Boutin, Amy Allen, Julia Michaels, and more.

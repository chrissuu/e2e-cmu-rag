How to Eat an Elephant
Y-Vonne’s main goal with ReadySet is to “empower people to see themselves” and change the way people work with each other while also maximizing the impact of organizations.
“Organizations want to run better, and they need to figure out how to engage and do business in an increasingly complex world,” Y-Vonne says. “Every leader needs to make a choice of whether they want an organization that is growing and functional or one that remains stagnant.”
Her firm works with governments, nonprofits, universities and Fortune 500 companies and has consulted with everyone from small startups to global, multimedia companies. There’s not a one-size-fits-all solution for each workplace’s culture, so Y-Vonne offers a variety of training paths and options to individualize approaches.
ReadySet focuses on capacity development, culture building and change management.
Each of those areas sounds like a massive undertaking, but Y-Vonne understands that success takes time and commitment.
She often relies on the wisdom of one of her mother’s expressions: “How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.”
“Changing culture is not something that you fix all at once, and it’s not something you do by yourself,” Y-Vonne says.
A workplace’s culture can feel amorphous — hard to describe, hard to measure. ReadySet’s quantitative approach gives a solid idea of how everyone in an organization experiences the culture and its impact.
“When the impact doesn’t align with intent or with values, we try to understand the root causes,” Y-Vonne says. “We look across metrics and focus on things like trust, growth and voice. From there, we figure out either the source of success or where places are falling short.”

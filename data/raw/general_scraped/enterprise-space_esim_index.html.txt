The Enterprise Space Information Management (ESIM) team is helping the university update its processes and technology to better manage information about our physical spaces. Streamlining our systems allows the university to create smarter, more-efficient ways of using data to make CMU life better by:
Ensuring the accuracy and availability of physical space information
Eliminating redundant efforts and space data across the university
Creating an informational single-source-of-truth to serve all of campus
Enhancing our service models and elevate our space data capabilities

Our Purpose
We aim to modernize space-related data management through faithful investments in staff, resources and technology solutions. This will provide a platform on which CMU can build consistent processes and informational support for space management initiatives across campus to achieve positive operational, financial and planning outcomes.
We do this by starting with the foundation of detailed core data and continuing to add capabilities to our service offerings over time. Learn more about our process and standards .

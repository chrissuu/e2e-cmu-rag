How does the Warhol Museum serve the community?
Over the past two and a half decades, The Warhol has provided artist educators who visit local schools and introduce art making techniques, partnered with programs like the Homeless Childrenâ€™s Education Fund and Highmark Caring Place to offer therapeutic art workshops for children and families affected by trauma, and supports the Gay Straight Alliances (GSAs) that fosters a healthy community among the LGBTQ+ youth throughout Pittsburgh.
What is unique about the Warhol Museum?
The museum, which celebrated its Silver Anniversary on May 13, 2019, has been a symbol of creativity throughout the city for 30+ years. His collections and archived materials rest here, making it the largest single-artist museum in North America. But what makes this museum so special is how it positively impacts the Pittsburgh community.

Itâ€™s Halloween night, 1991, and a rambunctious group of trick-or-treaters must retrieve their stolen candy from a haunted cabin in the woods. However, when a mysterious force transforms them into their costumes, the gang must use their magical new abilities to save the kidnapped Moth Man! This brand new table top role playing game show is based on NIGHT OF THE MOTH MAN, a Bedlam Arts and Goods game by Pittsburgh-based designer Eamon McNamee. Each night is a new adventure in this spooky D&D-style comedy show. Or you catch all three nights to witness the full terror that is NIGHT OF THE MOTH MAN.
Starring Regina Connolly, Paul Fields, Tal Kroser, Kendall White, and John Feightner as the Game Master
Produced by Connor McCanlus

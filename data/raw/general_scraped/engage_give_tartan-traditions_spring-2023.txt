A new tax law, known as SECURE Act 2.0, has changed rules governing retirement funds â€” and these changes could be beneficial to you as you consider gifts to Carnegie Mellon University.
For example, if you are age 70 1/2 or older, you can now make a one-time, tax-free transfer from your traditional IRA to create a charitable gift annuity.
With this new giving option, you can:
Create guaranteed lifetime income for your retirement
Help meet your required minimum distribution (RMD)
Support your favorite department, school or college, scholarship, academic program, student organization or research at CMU

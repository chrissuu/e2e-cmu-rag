McKeesport , city , Allegheny county, southwestern Pennsylvania , U.S. It is situated at the junction of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers, 14 miles (23 km) southeast of Pittsburgh . First settled about 1769 by David McKee, a ferry operator, the town was laid out in 1795 by his son John. In 1794 it was a centre of dissident activity during the Whiskey Rebellion (an insurrection against an excise tax on distilled liquors). Coal mining began in the area about 1830, but McKeesport did not develop appreciably until the basic ingredients of the steel industry (coal, iron, and railroads) coalesced in the late 19th century. It became part of the Pittsburgh industrial complex, with steel production as the dominant activity.
McKeesport began experiencing considerable unemployment as the steel industries in the Pittsburgh area declined in the 1980s. Some light manufacturing (steel pipe, pressurized containers, speciality steel products) continues in the city, and service industries are important. A marina has been built along the Youghiogheny River. The McKeesport campus of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State McKeesport) opened in 1947. Inc. borough, 1842; city, 1891. Pop.

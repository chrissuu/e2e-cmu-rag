He changed his tune upon realizing the operational logistics of the team and mission were in his range.
“When you’re on the clock with 10 seconds to launch and you’ve got to know when each piece moves — that’s exactly like playing in an orchestra,” said Harper, who gave input and direction on the smooth flow of operations within mission control, and developed operational contingency plans in the event of unexpected hurdles. “Knowing how that works, how to communicate effectively and quickly, is something that feels very familiar.”
As a musician working on Iris, Harper wasn’t solo. Carmyn Talento, a senior earning their Bachelor of Science and Arts (opens in new window) (BSA) through the university’s BXA Intercollege Degree Program, chose Carnegie Mellon’s because they wanted “a truly interdisciplinary route.”
“I truly feel passionate about both things — music and physics — and what better way to live my life than to do both,” Talento said. “It’s kind of cliche, but I always love to look up at the sky and just be fascinated by the stars.”
A physicist and euphonium player, Talento was the representation lead, organizing media-related events and finding ways to make the project accessible to all audiences. They previously worked on the MoonYard team, which used a testing sandbox and duplicate rover to mimic and plan out Iris’ movements on the moon. A projector hanging over the sandbox projects the moon’s surface, and team members reshaped the sand surface to reflect rocks and craters.
“I spent my childhood looking up at the sky and wondering. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something out of this world,” Talento said.

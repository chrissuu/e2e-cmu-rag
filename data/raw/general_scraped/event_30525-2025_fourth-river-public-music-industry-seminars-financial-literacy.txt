Helping artists become financially literate in personal finances and the basics of becoming a small business. Covering technical topics (taxes, necessary registrations, business vs. personal cards, accounting, etc.) and offering advice as to how artists should approach their money so they see it as a tool rather than an obstacle. Guest speakers: Ally Jane Ayers, CFPÂ® (Co-Founder of Brooklyn Fi) and Adam Degonish (Business Banking Relationship Manager, Citizens Bank).
Fourth River, a collaboration between Honcho PGH and The Rising Artist Foundation, is proud to present our FREE Public Music Industry Seminars, every Saturday from Oct. 11 to Nov. 15 at Wood Street Galleries. Named in homage to the city's underground, essential aquifer, this program will help artists nourish and navigate their creative careers with clarity. Each week, we'll present different topics with leading guest speakers to help demystify the music industry for rising music makers.
Advance RSVP via Resident Advisor is required to attend.

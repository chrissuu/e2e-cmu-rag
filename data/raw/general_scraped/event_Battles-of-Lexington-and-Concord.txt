Battles of Lexington and Concord ,  (April 19, 1775), initial skirmishes between British regulars and American provincials , marking the beginning of the American Revolution .
Acting on orders from London to suppress the rebellious colonists, General Thomas Gage , recently appointed royal governor of Massachusetts , ordered his troops to seize the colonists’ military stores at Concord . En route from Boston , the British force of 700 men was met on Lexington Green by 77 local minutemen and others who had been forewarned of the raid by the colonists’ efficient lines of communication, including the ride of Paul Revere . It is unclear who fired the “shot heard ‘round the world,” but the provincials steadfastly maintained that the regulars were the first to discharge their weapons. In their subsequent communication with King George III , the colonials stated that they returned the fire and fought through the day in strict defense of their rights as English citizens.
The British opening volley at Lexington left 8 colonials dead and 10 wounded, and resistance quickly melted away. The British then moved on to Concord. Most of the American military supplies had been hidden or destroyed before the British troops arrived. A British covering party at Concord’s North Bridge was finally confronted by 320 to 400 American patriots and forced to withdraw.

The march back to Boston was a genuine ordeal for the British, with Americans continually firing on them from behind roadside houses, barns, trees, and stone walls. This experience established guerrilla warfare as the colonists’ best defense strategy against the British. Total losses were British 273, American 95. The Battles of Lexington and Concord confirmed the alienation between the majority of colonists and the mother country, and it roused 16,000 New Englanders to join forces and begin the Siege of Boston , resulting in its evacuation by the British the following March.

EITC is a program offered by the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development that allows businesses to receive significant tax credits when they contribute to state-qualified educational programming.
The PSO is recognized by the PA Department of Community and Economic Development as an Educational Improvement Organization. Besides being a “stamp of approval” regarding the quality of PSO programs, this designation allows companies to make contributions to the PSO through the EITC program . A high percentage of an EITC donation may be used as a direct tax credit for a variety of state business taxes. Tax credits equal to 75% of its contribution up to a maximum of $750,000 per taxable year. This can be increased to 90% of the contribution, if the business agrees to provide same amount for two consecutive tax years.

Get your finished project out into the world. Letâ€™s talk about how to release good music on a bad budget, how to approach your image, and marketing yourself online. Guest speakers: Fabienne Leys (ATC Management) and Adam Farrell (Loma Vista Records).
Fourth River, a collaboration between Honcho PGH and The Rising Artist Foundation, is proud to present our FREE Public Music Industry Seminars, every Saturday from Oct. 11 to Nov. 15 at Wood Street Galleries. Named in homage to the city's underground, essential aquifer, this program will help artists nourish and navigate their creative careers with clarity. Each week, we'll present different topics with leading guest speakers to help demystify the music industry for rising music makers.
Advance RSVP via Resident Advisor is required to attend.

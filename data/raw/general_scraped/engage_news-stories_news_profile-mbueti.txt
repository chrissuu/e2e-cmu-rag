“One of the places we’re seeing changes is in 100 plus-year storms. The frequency and strength of storms are changing to a degree,” he says. “Some of the storms we are seeing are more powerful, or in areas we haven’t seen impacted before.”
With only have a century of well-observed storms, a few major events can change the statistical distribution significantly.
“Our statistical modelers are incredibly sharp and are pushing the envelope with how well they can represent hypothetical stochastic scenarios year after year, which is where a lot of our major improvements come from,” Mike says. “But also, we have more data and a deeper understanding of what is a black swan event versus a normal five-, 10- or 20-year event. Something we used to think of as a 100-year storm may not be. We just haven’t seen it in 50 years and are encountering a sampling bias.”
The work Mike does builds on the foundation he created at Carnegie Mellon, from the courses he studied in physics to the computer science classes he took.
“I didn’t major or minor in computer science at Carnegie Mellon, but if you enjoy working in computer systems and don’t take advantage of one of the very best computer science programs in the world to hone your chops, you’re wasting a huge opportunity,” he says. “I came out with this skill set of being a programmer and software engineer along with my physics training.”
His doctoral studies and stints in the tech industry honed those skills even further. He encourages students early in their career to consider how physics is about seeing the world as systems.
“It’s a way of thinking and approaching and solving problems,” Mike says. “If you can understand how to break a problem down and move forward with it, you can carry that into many places you wouldn’t expect to find a physicist.”

Pittsburgh Women’s Clan Scholarship The Pittsburgh Women’s Clan Scholarship seems to have begun in the late 1930s during the Depression to help junior women achieve their Carnegie Tech education. Ultimately, the Women’s Clan merged with the Pittsburgh Clan to form the Pittsburgh Network. The scholarship continues to support women in their junior year.

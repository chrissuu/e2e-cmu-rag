Innovating and Growing
After graduating with her bachelor’s degree in 1989, Laura took a role in finance, and she says she soon felt something was missing.
“It just didn't hit that problem-solving itch for me,” Laura says. “Finance lacked the aspect of rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands dirty. At that time, the internet was just emerging, and the digital music world was in an interesting place to start.”
Her next move to Universal Music Group provided the challenge she was looking for.
It was 2001, and anything involving the internet was uncharted territory. She made the jump based on skills, since no one had direct experience. People were as hungry to consume music online as Laura was to solve the operational challenges necessary to deliver it to them. Within a few years, her group acquired Napster out of bankruptcy and set to transforming it from a free, legally questionable file-sharing service to a legitimate music-on-demand subscription service.
From music, Laura jumped to sports, shepherding and growing product lines and online presence, for the NFL and ScoreBig.
“I really cut my teeth in operations,” Laura says. “I owned marketing, technology and call centers that helped me develop a lot of skills around both general management and ops.”
When a contact from her music industry days called looking for a CMO for LegalZoom, she wasn’t sure why they were reaching out to her.
“I said, ‘I'm not a CMO. Why would you call me?’ They told me that they have people who know the legal marketing and technology, but no one who is solving for the customer.”
After some conversations, she “fell in love” with LegalZoom and their mission.

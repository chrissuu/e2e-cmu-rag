Notes:
Students taking courses in Heinz College and Tepper School of Business (MBA
and Computational Finance programs) must review and follow separate
*
academic calendars; Similarly, students taking doctoral courses must review
and follow the doctoral calendar for those courses.
Students dropping a course while remaining enrolled (in at least one course-
section) will receive a tuition adjustment only if they drop by this date. Students
1
taking a Leave of Absence or Withdrawing from the university should consult
the official Tuition Adjustment Policy.
2 Not applicable for graduate students in CFA, DC & SCS. Only graduate students
in CIT, HC, MCS & TSB students receive W grades for course withdrawal.
Course withdrawal is not an option after this date for students taking
undergraduate or masters course-sections. Students must decide if they wish
to use their course drop voucher, and should discuss their options with their
3
academic advisor in advance of these dates.
-- Students taking course-sections designated as doctoral courses are exempt
from this restriction ONLY IN THOSE designated course-sections.
Advisor approval is required for vouchers to be initiated. It is strongly
recommended that you contact your advisor prior to the
4 posted deadline to discuss options.
-- Please contact your advisor before 12 noon on the deadline date.
-- Doctoral students do not receive vouchers.
Regarding Grade Due dates, please note that fall & spring mid-semester as well
as mini-1 & 3 grades are due the Monday after break instead of during break in
**
both fall and spring. This confirms to a desire for a single due date, and with
mini finals on Saturday, it provides additional time for grading.
Summer Session All corresponds to Summer Semester Dates. Summer Session
*** One and Summer Session Two correspond to Summer One & Mini-5and
Summer Two & Mini-6 dates & deadlines, respectively.
Summer Session All, One and Two Final Exams will be scheduled by the
****
University Registrar's Office.

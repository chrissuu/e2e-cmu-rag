Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Minor
The social and political history major is a research- and writing-intensive program that emphasizes the analysis of change over time and an in-depth understanding of the societies, cultures, economies, political systems and conflicts that have shaped our world.
The broad analytical, research and writing skills cultivated by the SPH major will prepare you for success in a wide variety of graduate and professional schools. Often, history graduates pursue further scholarship in law, business administration, education, public policy, urban planning, librarianship, journalism, the ministry, or social work.

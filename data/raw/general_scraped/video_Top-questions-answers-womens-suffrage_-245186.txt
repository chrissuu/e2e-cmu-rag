Women’s Suffrage Movement What did the women's suffrage movement fight for? The women’s suffrage movement fought to give women a legal right to vote in national or local elections. When did the women's suffrage movement start? It was in the 19th century that the women’s suffrage movement made the question of women's voting rights an important political issue, particularly in the United States and Great Britain. Where did women’s suffrage start? By the early 20th century, women had won the right to vote in national elections in New Zealand (1893), Australia (1902), Finland (1906), and Norway (1913). World War I helped to hasten the enfranchisement of women elsewhere, and by 1939 an additional 28 countries had granted new voting rights to women. How did the women's suffrage movement end? Most countries now allow women to vote. In 1952 the United Nations Convention on the Political Rights of Women was adopted, declaring that “women shall be entitled to vote in all elections on equal terms with men, without any discrimination.”

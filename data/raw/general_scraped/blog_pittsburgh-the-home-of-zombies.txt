Pittsburgh celebrates Romero's legacy in a number of ways, including showings of his films at arthouse cinemas all the way up to towering screens at the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center. Check schedules around September and October each year for the current showings.
And, if IMAX-sized zombies still doesn’t satiate your need for nightmare fuel, take a day adventure to the Monroeville Mall where the second movie was filmed and check out the The Living Dead Museum , featuring interactive experiences, memorabilia and even a bronze bust of the filmmaker.
This mall is also the location of the annual The Living Dead Weekend from June 6-8, 2025, celebrating Romero's films with celebrity appearances, film site tours and cosplay—providing a truly immersive experience in your never ending search for more ‘braaains!’
Just remember to stay quiet, move fast, and aim for the head. Zombies are pretty slow…most of the time!

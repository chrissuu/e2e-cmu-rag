What we can do for you:
The staff of the Office of Institutional Research and Analysis operate under the leadership of the Office of the Vice Provost for Institutional Effectiveness and Planning to contribute to meaningful work across all areas of Carnegie Mellon University. By collecting, organizing, and analyzing information, their resulting insights allow staff and faculty to better understand the CMU community and the environment in which they work.
Partnership Model
Each college or division, as well as some departments within administrative divisions, has an IRandA staff member as their partner .
The partner serves as the primary point of contact for the unit, in order to establish regular communication, make sure the informational and analytical needs of the unit are being met, and streamline communication to a single contact outside of regularly-occurring projects.

How DAF Grants Work
Establish a DAF with a sponsoring organization . Most financial institutions now offer DAF partnerships, and your local community foundation also specializes in this area.
Make a gift . In addition to cash or publicly traded securities, many DAF sponsoring organizations are equipped to accept gifts of appreciated assets, such as real estate, business interests and non-publicly traded securities. Your gift may be tax deductible.
Invest your gift . The sponsoring organization may offer a variety of investment options for your fund, helping it grow tax free.
Recommend grants . You then “advise” gifts to qualified charitable organizations like CMU to support the people and causes closest to your heart.
Planning ahead . Working with your DAF sponsoring organization, you may designate CMU or other charitable organizations as beneficiaries of your DAF where any remaining balance will be distributed after your passing. This can be an additional way to establish your philanthropic legacy and ensure the money will be used by your favorite charities.
As always, please consult with your personal legal, tax and financial counsel to ensure a DAF is right for you and prior to making a charitable gift.

Looking back on the momentous fiscal year that began on April 1, 2020—marked by the global pandemic of Covid-19, the national reckoning with racial justice, the launch of our new Strategic Plan, the 30th anniversary of Clayton’s restoration and public opening, and the 50th anniversary of The Frick Art Museum’s founding—we have much to be thankful for. Our staff, members, and visitors found new ways to engage with our collections and eachother; individuals and funders in our community stepped forward with support when we needed it most; and the Frick has emerged from this year a more flexible, humble, and socially committed organization.

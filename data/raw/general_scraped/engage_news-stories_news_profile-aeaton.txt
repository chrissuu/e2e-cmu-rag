Diplomacy in Action
In 2020, Alan was stationed as a consular officer in Chengdu, China, when the U.S. government issued an evacuation order in response to COVID-19.
The State Department asked for volunteers from Chengdu to join the evacuation mission in Wuhan, where more than 800 Americans were waiting to leave the country. Alan and his husband, who was also stationed in Chengdu, both agreed to participate. As consular officers, they were tasked with helping their fellow Americans get to the airport, navigate through immigrations and safely board the plane.
Since then, Alan has volunteered for two more evacuations: Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2021 and Port Sudan, Sudan, in 2023.
“Having been involved with one evacuation, I felt comfortable volunteering for more,” he says. “It sparked my interest.”
During each evacuation, he was inspired by the hard work of those around him.
“There's a whole national security apparatus working behind the scenes,” he says. “The conduct of diplomacy is typically very quiet and under-appreciated. Witnessing all of these great diplomats working and people coming together for a greater goal was really inspiring.”
He says he is open to volunteering for another evacuation in the future, but only if he feels ready.
“If the call comes through, you have to be really comfortable with also saying no,” he says. “There’s a good saying that if you run into the fire too many times, you're eventually going to get burned. I think that's an important thing to acknowledge. This is dangerous and serious stuff, so if you're not 100% in, don't do it.”

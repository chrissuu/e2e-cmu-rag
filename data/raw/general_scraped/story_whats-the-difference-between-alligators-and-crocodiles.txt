Don’t know a gator from a crocodile ? You’re probably not alone. Although these large reptiles belong to different families, they share a number of similarities, including long snouts, powerful tails, short legs, and bony-plated backs. But there are some easy ways to tell them apart. The first is the shape of the snout. In alligators it’s broad and U-shaped, while in crocodiles it’s narrow and V-shaped. Next are the teeth. In the case of alligators, the lower teeth are typically not visible when the mouth is shut. In crocodiles, however, some teeth in the bottom jaw appear, most notably the large fourth tooth. Another difference is color. Gray or black? It’s probably a gator. Olive or tan? A crocodile. The two reptiles also differ in location. Crocodiles are usually found in saltwater habitats, while alligators prefer freshwater areas. And last—but definitely not least—is behavior. Crocodiles are typically more aggressive than gators.

ProCon is a leading nonpartisan site for learning the top arguments behind debatable issues of the day.
What is ProCon?
ProCon’s mission is to promote civility, critical thinking, education, and informed citizenship by presenting the pro and con arguments to debatable issues in a straightforward, nonpartisan, freely accessible way. ProCon works to achieve those goals by presenting sourced pros and cons of debatable issues, as well as a host of reference information relevant to those issues, all thoroughly researched and compiled by its research staff and editors. The pro-con format achieves four objectives:
First, by exposing readers to both sides of an issue in a side-by-side style, ProCon makes it easier for readers to see the difference in the facts and arguments offered by each side.

Second, the pro and con format allows readers to engage in evaluative thinking to formulate their own views. Readers who have a preexisting view of an issue may feel more confident in their view, or they may change their view. In either case, many will recognize that the process of acquiring and critically evaluating information has a beneficial and satisfying effect on their decision-making.

Fourth, challenging readers to examine both sides of an issue tends to reduce the likelihood that they will resort to “demonizing” those who hold opposing views.

For each of the U.S. presidential elections since 2008, ProCon has attracted millions of readers with its coverage of the candidates and their positions on key issues. In 2012 , The New York Times hailed ProCon’s election site as “the most comprehensive tool for researching the candidate’s stance on issues.” The Times recommended ProCon again in 2016 and 2020 as among the essential election sites for students wanting to engage with the presidential campaign.

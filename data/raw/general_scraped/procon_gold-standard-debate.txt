Since its founding in 1776 the United States has had a variety of monetary systems. These include bimetallic systems, where the dollar was backed by both gold and silver (1792–1862); a fiat monetary system (1862–79), in which paper money, which has no intrinsic or fixed value and is not backed by or exchangeable for any other asset like gold or silver, is declared legal tender by government fiat (decree); a full gold standard (1879–1933); and a partial gold standard (1933–71). From 1971 to present the United States has been on a fiat monetary standard. [71]
1792–1862: The Bimetallic Standard
In Apr. 1792 Congress passed the first Coinage Act, based on the recommendations of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton , which established the U.S. Mint to provide official coin currency for the nation’s bimetallic monetary system (dollar valued in gold and silver). The act fixed the dollar as the equivalent of 24.75 grains of gold and 371.25 grains of silver. [71]
The act specified the production of coins in the following denominations: half cent and cent in copper; half dime, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar in silver; and quarter eagle ($2.50), half eagle ($5), and eagle ($10) in gold. In March 1793 the Mint provided 11,178 copper coins, the first circulating U.S. coins. [136]
The first U.S. Gold Eagle coins produced by the Philadelphia Mint in 1795 had a face value of $10 and contained 247.5 grains of pure gold. [71] [137]
Paper money (backed by gold and silver reserves) was also printed and circulated by banks and the U.S. Treasury , though there was no legal-tender paper money prior to the American Civil War . During this time large silver finds in Mexico and South America caused a decline in the market value of silver relative to gold, resulting in an influx of silver flowing to the U.S. mint for coinage. Gold coins began to leave circulation as their metal content became worth more than their face value. [39] [71]
To bring gold coins back into U.S. circulation, on June 28, 1834, Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1834 to reduce the gold value of one dollar to 23.2 grains of gold. Gold discoveries in Russia, Australia, and California in 1848 significantly increased the amount of gold on the market and further reduced its value in comparison to silver. [39] [78]
In 1849 the gold influx from California prompted Congress to authorize the minting and circulation of a $1 gold liberty coin and a $20 double eagle coin. At one-fourth of the size of a dime, the $1 liberty coin is the smallest U.S. coin that has ever existed. The $20 double eagle is the largest. [77]
By 1850 the silver content of coins was worth more melted down than the face value of the coin, and silver coins began to disappear from circulation. The Coinage Act of Feb. 21, 1853, was passed. The Act lowered the silver content of the coins to increase circulation of small-value silver coins during a silver shortage. Some argue that this legislation pushed the United States closer to abandoning a bimetallic standard and adopting a full gold standard. [39] [138]
1862–79: The Civil War Fiat Standard
Civil War spending caused a Union shortage of legal tender coins, the only American legal tender currency at the time. In Feb. 1862, less than one year after the outbreak of the Civil War , the United States passed the Legal Tender Act, authorizing the issue of the first paper fiat currency and creating a national currency for the first time. These bills, known as “greenbacks,” were not backed by gold or silver. To help finance the Civil War, the Union issued nearly $450 million of these greenbacks (and $500 billion in war bonds). The federal government had amassed a $2.76 billion national debt in 1866 (up from $65 million in 1860). [63] [79] [106] [139] [140]
In an attempt to move to a gold standard after the Civil War, the government began reducing the amount of money in circulation by destroying the greenback bills. By this time a national debate was boiling over whether the government had a legal right to issue fiat currency. Creditors who were angry over the wartime inflation, which they believed the greenbacks had created, took the issue to court. [2] [82]
In 1870 Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Salmon P Chase , reversing the position he held as treasury secretary that greenbacks were “necessary and proper,” led the Supreme Court majority opinion that portions of the Legal Tender Acts were unconstitutional. However, in 1871, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Hepburn v. Griswold and upheld the constitutionality of fiat currency with two decisions: Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis . [82]
The 1873 Fourth Coinage Act ended the ability to exchange silver at a fixed price and discontinued government production of silver dollars. Shortly after the act passed, the collapse of a large banking house (Jay Cooke & Co.) triggered the Panic of 1873. During the panic 101 banks failed as people rushed to withdraw their savings. [83] [84] [85]
The Greenback Party was formed in Nov. 1874 by those who were upset over the effects of deflation caused by the Panic of 1873 to advocate for a fiat money standard. They favored inflationary policies that would expand the money supply with silver currency and government-issued paper bills. [63] [86] [141]
Similarly disaffected by the 1873 Coinage Act, a populist coalition of silver mine owners, farmers, and debtors formed the Free Silver Movement , which advocated for unlimited coinage of silver under the belief that it would increase the price of crops and make debts easier to pay. [143]
These populist movements were countered by advocates of the gold standard, known as “gold bugs.” On Jan. 14, 1875, gold bugs won a victory when Congress passed the Resumption Act of 1875 (also called the Specie Payment Resumption Act ), which mandated that the U.S. Treasury reduce the number of greenbacks in circulation to $300 million, replace small paper currency with silver coins, and beginning on Jan. 1, 1879, all greenbacks still in circulation would become redeemable in gold. [63] [87]
1879–1933: The Gold Standard
The late 19th century was marked by a series of bank failures. A small banking panic hit the United States in May 1884, when 42 banks failed, and was followed by an 18-bank failure in Nov. 1890. In 1893 a large-scale banking panic hit, triggering a deep depression and the failure of over 500 banks. The crisis began with federal gold reserves falling to approximately $100 million from $190 million in 1890 and was fueled by customers withdrawing funds from banks and defaulting on loans. [85] [88] [142]
Thus, the 1896 presidential election featured debates about the gold standard. Republican William McKinley ran on a pro-gold standard platform while populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan opposed a gold standard. [83]
Bryan, an advocate of free silver, made the issue of the gold standard central to his campaign. His address to the Democratic national convention became known as the “ Cross of Gold speech ,” in which he stated: “Upon which side shall the Democratic Party fight. Upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital, or upon the side of the struggling masses?…If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we shall fight them to the uttermost, having behind us the producing masses of the nation and the world. Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” [144]
The Republican Party Platform of 1896 articulated their opposing position: “The Republican party is unreservedly for sound money. It caused the enactment of a law providing for the redemption [resumption] of specie payments in 1879. Since then every dollar has been as good as gold. We are unalterably opposed to every measure calculated to debase our currency or impair the credit of our country. We are therefore opposed to the free coinage of silver.…All of our silver and paper currency must be maintained at parity with gold.” [91]
McKinley, the pro-gold standard Republican candidate, won the 1896 election , and on Mar. 14, 1900, he signed the Gold Standard Act, officially ending the use of silver as a standard for U.S. currency and formally putting the United States on a gold standard. [92] [71]
On Dec. 23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law. The Federal Reserve System was created, in part, to prevent future banking panics. The act allowed the Federal Reserve to print paper money (“Federal Reserve notes”) that could be lent to banks when the need for cash arose. At least 40% of the value of Federal Reserve notes in circulation had to be held in gold reserves. [71] [85] [88] [93] [145]
During World War I (1914–18), many nations were forced off gold standards, with the exception of the United States. Many later returned to gold exchange standards , in which reserves are kept in currencies other than gold that are convertible to gold, such as sterling and dollars. [39] [71]
During World War I and into the 1920s, gold flowed into the Federal Reserve from Europe as payment for U.S. imports. By Aug. 1929 the Federal Reserve banks held $3.12 billion in gold—twice the amount that was necessary to back the Federal Reserve notes in circulation. [93]
However, 1929 marked the beginning of one of the worst American financial crises to date. On Oct. 24 of that year, Black Thursday heralded the U.S. stock market crash , which in turn triggered the Great Depression . In response the Federal Reserve pursued a policy of deflation, allowing the money in circulation to drop in relation to its gold reserves. Between 1930 and 1932 cumulative deflation hit 30% and nearly 10,000 banks failed. By early Mar. 1933 the Federal Reserve’s gold reserves were below the legal 40% limit. [39] [88] [94] [95] [146]
1933–71: The International Gold Exchange Standard
In response to the deepening economic crisis, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared a three-day banking holiday effective from Mar. 6 to Mar. 9, which suspended the ability to redeem paper money for gold. On Mar. 9 he signed the Emergency Banking Act, giving himself emergency powers over banking transactions and gold policy. Then on Apr. 5 he issued an executive order forbidding the “hoarding” of gold (gold jewelry and coins with numismatic value were exempt). All monetary gold coins, bullion, or gold certificates worth more than $100 were to be turned in to the government, at which time people were compensated for their gold at $20.67 per ounce. The right to own gold was not restored until 1974. [39]
On Jan. 15, 1934, Roosevelt issued a statement to Congress arguing, “The practice of transferring gold from one individual to another or from the government to an individual within a nation is not only unnecessary, but is in every way undesirable,” and recommended that the U.S. government should take permanent legal “title to all supplies of American-owned monetary gold.” Two weeks later on Jan. 30, Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act, which legally nationalized all U.S. gold, meaning the federal government controlled all private stores of gold. The next day, Roosevelt devalued the dollar from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce—the price it would remain at until 1971. This devaluation was undertaken to stabilize domestic prices, and within a few years the 10.27% average annual inflation of 1932 had transformed into a 2.99% average annual inflation in 1935. In 1936 construction of the U.S. Bullion Depository at Fort Knox was completed to store the government’s gold reserves, and by Dec. 31, 1941, it held 649.6 million ounces of gold. [96] [97] [147]
Toward the conclusion of World War II in July 1944, the Bretton Woods system was finalized by delegates from 44 countries at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire . Primarily designed by John Maynard Keynes , advisor to the British Treasury, and Harry Dexter White, chief international economist at the U.S. Treasury Department, the system was meant to establish and maintain exchange rate stability and promote economic growth. The Bretton Woods system established the International Money Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (now the World Bank Group ). Under the international monetary system, all countries agreed to keep the value of their currency stable by not inflating or deflating their currency by more than 1%. The dollar became the mechanism by which this was made possible as countries bought and sold dollars to keep their own currencies stable. The United States pledged to back the dollar with gold and any foreign holder of dollars could exchange dollars for gold at $35 per ounce. [148]
Foreign aid, foreign investment, and military spending created a surplus of U.S. dollars in the 1960s, and the country did not have enough gold to cover the dollar at $35 an ounce of gold. President John F. Kennedy , followed by President Lyndon B. Johnson , worked to support the dollar and the Bretton Woods system. But, by the late 1960s a large fiscal deficit had developed as the United States increased its printing of dollars to fund spending on the Vietnam War and Johnson’s “Great Society” social programs. [74] [152]
In 1965 Congress approved minting of copper- and nickel-clad coins to replace silver coins. On Mar. 5, 1965, and in Mar. 1968, respectively, Congress passed laws to “eliminate gold reserves against Federal Reserves deposits” and to “eliminate the gold reserve against Federal Reserve notes.” [71]
1971–present: The Fiat Standard
On Aug. 7, 1971, the Joint Economic Subcommittee on International Exchange and Payments reported that the U.S. dollar was “overvalued” and urged that the dollar be devalued. As a result, President Richard Nixon announced on Aug. 15, 1971, that dollars held by foreign countries would no longer be exchangeable for gold in order to “protect the dollar from the attacks of international money speculators .” Called the “Nixon Shock,” the actions led foreign countries to redeem dollars for gold immediately. French President George Pompidou sent a warship to retrieve France’s gold from the New York Federal Reserve Bank. [149] [150] [151] [152]
While the 1971 actions did not kill the Bretton Woods system immediately, the system would suffer another blow in Feb. 1973, when the dollar was further devalued and six European Community members de facto abandoned Bretton Woods. [152]
President Gerald Ford signed legislation in 1974 allowing Americans to own gold bullion again, which repealed the Apr. 5, 1933, order against “hoarding” gold implemented by President Roosevelt. Thus, when President Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, monetary conservatives saw an opening for policy change and began advocating for a return to the gold standard to fight inflation. Reagan appointed the U.S. Gold Commission to study the issue on June 22, 1981; however, the commission “oppose[d] the issue of Treasury gold-backed notes or bonds,” and concluded on Mar. 31, 1982, that “restoring a gold standard does not appear to be a fruitful method for dealing with the continuing problem of inflation.” The commission recommended that the U.S. Treasury begin production of gold bullion coins for sale to the public. On Dec. 17, 1985, President Reagan signed the Gold Bullion Act of 1985, authorizing the production of U.S. gold coins minted by the Treasury for the first time in 50 years. [39] [101] [102] [153] [154]
The debate would then largely fall fallow . However, during the 2012 presidential primary race the gold standard debate resurfaced when Republican candidate U.S. Representative Ron Paul (R-TX) made the topic a major focus of his campaign. Paul had been a member of the 1981 Gold Commission but did not agree with the conclusions of the majority. Paul and the minority of the commission concluded: “The only way price stability can be restored here (indeed, in the world) is by making the dollar (and other national currencies) convertible into gold. Linking money to gold domestically and internationally will solve the problem of inflation, high interest rates, and budget deficits.” [39]
The 2012 Republican Party platform called for a new gold commission to “investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar.” In response to the renewed debate, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke addressed the issue of a gold standard in a 2012 lecture, arguing that a gold standard “would not be feasible for both practical reasons and policy reasons.” [44] [69]
According to the World Gold Council, as of the end of 2019, an estimated 197,576 tonnes of gold has been mined throughout history, with about two-thirds having been mined since 1950. Almost all of that gold still exists, because the metal is virtually indestructible. If all 197,576 tonnes of gold were placed in a cube, the cube would only measure about 71.2 feet (21.7 meters) on each side. Some 47% of that gold is currently jewelry, 21.6% is in private investment, 17.2% is in official holdings, and 14.2% is in other forms. [156]
Although there is now no official link between the dollar and gold, the U.S. Treasury reported holding 261.5 million fine troy ounces (about $11.0 billion) in gold between the Federal Reserve and the Mint on July 31, 2020. The U.S. Mint holds about 2.8 million ounces of its gold as “working stock” to be used in the production of official U.S. gold coins for sale to the public as numismatic collectibles and for investment purposes. [155]
The gold standard debate enjoyed a brief resurgence in 2020 during the confirmation hearings of Judy Shelton for the Federal Reserve Board. Shelton favors a gold standard, adding credence to rumors that officials in President Donald Trump’s administration were promoting a return to a gold standard. However, the debate was overshadowed by the continuing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic , during which, on Aug. 5, 2020, gold prices rose to $2,000 per ounce for the first time ever because of a pandemic -weakened dollar. Since then, the debate over the gold standard has largely been quiet. [157] [158] [159] [160]

Pro 1: Gold’s value has been recognized throughout history, and a gold standard self-regulates to match the supply of money to the need for it.
American paper money is a “fiat” currency that can be printed without limit and has no real value—its value is only maintained by the “full faith and credit” of the government. Gold has real value because of its beauty, usefulness, and scarcity. Humanity has recognized the value of gold as a medium of exchange dating back to 550 bce , when the King of Lydia (modern day Turkey) began minting gold coins. Steve Forbes, editor-in-chief of Forbes , says gold “retains an intrinsic, stable value better than anything else.” [5] [65]
Since gold is a finite natural material and must be mined and processed at a significant cost, it tends to be produced at levels consistent with demand. Under a gold standard, creating more currency requires obtaining more gold, which raises gold’s market price and stimulates increased mining. More gold is then used to back more money until a point when currency levels are adequate, the price of gold levels out, and mining is scaled back accordingly. It is a self-regulating system. Under a fiat money system the production of money has no natural self-regulation mechanism. [22] [26]
Over the 179 years that the United States was on some form of a gold or metallic standard (1792–1971), the economy grew an average of 3.9% each year. Since 1971, under a fiat money standard not backed by gold in any way, economic growth has averaged 2.8% per year. This lower growth rate translates into an economy that is about $8 trillion dollars smaller than it would have been had the gold standard not been abandoned in 1971. [22] [26]
Pro 2: A gold standard reduces the risk of economic crises and recessions, while increasing income levels and decreasing unemployment rates.
The ability of the Federal Reserve to print fiat money (money not backed by a physical commodity such as gold) and maintain easy credit by keeping interest rates too low from 2001 to 2006 was a significant cause of the real estate bubble that led to the Great Recession. [21] [22] [23]
The response to the recession has been more of what caused it in the first place—literally printing more money. Over $2 trillion in bailouts for failed financial institutions was paid with Federal Reserve money, setting the stage for another possible bubble and collapse. The Federal Reserve’s history of providing economic stability with fiat money has not been a good one. Since the United States abandoned the gold standard there have been 13 financial crises, including the financial crisis of 2008–09 and the COVID-19 pandemic recession. [20] [24] [25] [113]
Prior to the United States abandoning the gold standard, the real median income for men rose an average of 2.7% per year between 1950 and 1968. Between leaving the gold standard in 1971 and 2011, the average median income for men only increased 0.2% per year. [28] [114]
In addition, unemployment levels were lower in the decades leading up to the United States abandoning the gold standard. Between 1944 and 1971, while on a partial gold standard, unemployment averaged 5%. From 1971 to 2019, unemployment levels have averaged 6.1% under the fiat money standard. [20] [115]
Pro 3: A gold standard puts limits on government power by restricting the ability to print money at will and increase the national debt.
With a fiat currency the government can essentially manufacture money out of thin air. [7]
Since leaving the gold standard in 1971 the amount of U.S. currency in circulation increased from $48.6 billion to more than $5.2 trillion in June 2020. Under a gold standard new money could only be printed if a corresponding amount of gold were available to back the currency. This restriction is an essential check on government power. [4] [118]
Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen Field, who served from 1863–97, argued against fiat money, stating, “Arguments in favor of the constitutionality of legal tender paper currency tend directly to break down the barriers which separate a government of limited powers from a government resting in the unrestrained will of Congress. Those limitations must be preserved, or our government will inevitably drift from the system established by our Fathers into a vast, centralized, and consolidated government.” [35]
Under the fiat money system used by the United States, the government can raise money by issuing treasury bonds, which the Federal Reserve can purchase with newly printed money. These bonds count toward the national debt. Between 1971 and 2019 the national debt increased 5,515% from $406 billion to $22.8 trillion. This increase in debt corresponded with an 2,606% increase in the money supply between May 1971 ($666.7 billion) and May 2020 ($18.0 trillion). [29] [119]
As a percentage of the GDP (gross domestic product) the national debt has more than doubled since leaving the gold standard, going from 35.6% in the fourth quarter 1971 to 107.7% in the first quarter of 2020. [106] [120]
Pro 4: Returning to a gold standard would prevent excessive money printing, reducing the U.S. trade deficit and military spending.
A trade deficit is when a country buys more goods and services (imports) than it sells (exports), creating the need for foreign financing that must be repaid when the deficit turns into a surplus (when the country is exporting more than it is importing). [121]
The current American fiat money system allows the Federal Reserve to finance large trade deficits by printing money. Since abandoning the gold standard in 1971, the United States has had the highest trade deficits the world has ever seen—reaching a high of $758 billion in 2006. [22] [122]
In May 2020 $6.78 trillion of American national debt was owned by foreign creditors. Japan held the most at $1.26 trillion, followed by China ($1.08 trillion), the United Kingdom ($394 billion), and Luxembourg ($262.7 billion), among other countries. American debt held by foreign creditors amounts to about a third of all U.S. debt. [123]
Japan and China want the value of the U.S. dollar to be higher than their own currencies. But, as Ron Paul, former U.S. Representative (R-TX) noted, “Debt of this sort always ends by the currency of the debtor nation decreasing in value. And that’s what has started to happen with the dollar, although it still has a long way to go. Our free lunch cannot last. Printing money, buying foreign products, and selling foreign holders of dollars our debt ends when the foreign holders of this debt become concerned with the dollar’s future value.” [12] [123]
According to Ron Paul, “Fiat money enable[s] government to maintain an easy war policy….To be truly opposed to preemptive and unnecessary wars one must advocate sound money to prevent the promoters of war from financing their imperialism.” [125]
The government’s ability to limitlessly print fiat paper money allows it to fund a massive global defense establishment, an estimated 800 military bases in 80 or more countries and an operational ground troop presence in at least 15 countries. [127] [128]
The U.S. defense budget was $738 billion for 2020. In 2019 defense spending was $732 billion, or about 38% of global defense spending, and almost as much as the next ten countries’ defense spending combined. [129] [130]
This level of spending would not be possible if the United States returned to a full gold standard.

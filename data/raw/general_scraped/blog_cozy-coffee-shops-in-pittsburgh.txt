Like many of us coffee shop lovers out there, Iâ€™m a sucker for exposed brick and bulletin walls that showcase local creativity. Commonplace prides itself as seeing coffee as a way to build community, and when you walk into one of their multiple locations throughout the city, you feel just that.
Creative juices are flowing (literally and figuratively) as soon as you walk through the door. And if you find yourself snowed in or unable to make it to the coffee shop, you can sign up for a subscription service that sends well-sourced, carefully roasted directly to you.
Locations: Garfield, Mexican War Streets, Rockwell Park, Southside Words, Squirrel Hill

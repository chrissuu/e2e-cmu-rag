Purchase Art
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust wants you to live with art. Our goal is to empower artists and help your collection grow. Most of our gallery shows feature artwork that can be purchased and taken home at the end of the exhibition. The Trust makes purchasing a work of art simple whether you are a first-time buyer or a seasoned collector — our galleries offer a variety of price points.
When you explore the Trust's art galleries, you'll find works that you can't find anywhere else in the world. They're unique and the artists who create them are very passionate about what they do. You are sure to have beautiful artwork to display at home—that no one else has!
Plus, buying art in the Cultural District means that you're funding artists in your own community; you are directly supporting the people who make the art! Pittsburgh based artists have impacted how the Cultural District looks, including neighborhood design, gardens, public space, sculpture parks, and more. So by supporting our arts ecosystem you're helping Pittsburgh thrive.

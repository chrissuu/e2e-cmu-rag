With an initial focus on the future of work, the Block Center will examine the impact of technology on the ways in which workers at all skill levels will make their living in the 21st century. The Block Center will complement multiple existing CMU ventures such as Metro 21, CMU’s smart cities; the Simon Initiative; and CMU’s learning science and engineering programs.
“Innovation delivers powerful advancements that will have a profound impact on everyone,” said Block. “CMU sits at the intersection of technology and policy — uniquely positioned to bring together the public and private sectors to make the world a better place.”
Block, a member of the university’s Board of Trustees, earned a Master of Science degree in Management and Policy Analysis and a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon in 1984. He is also a long-time member of the Heinz College Dean’s Advisory Board and has worked closely with Dean Ramayya Krishnan .
In his role at Salesforce , the world's leading provider of customer relationship management software with more than 150,000 customers, Block serves on its board of directors and leads the company’s day-to-day operations. Prior to joining Salesforce in 2013, he served as Oracle’s executive vice president of North America Sales and Consulting. Block began his career at Booz Allen Hamilton as a senior consultant. “We are immensely proud of Keith’s achievements as one of the leading voices in tech, and I am personally grateful for his counsel,” Dean Krishnan said. “With this gift, Keith and Suzanne are supporting the important work at the heart of Heinz College and the university, as we shape a world in which people, policy and technology are connected for the betterment of society.”

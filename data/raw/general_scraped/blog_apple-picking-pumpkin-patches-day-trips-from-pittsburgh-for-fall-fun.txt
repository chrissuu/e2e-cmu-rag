My personal bias is that Trax is the best pumpkin patch in the Pittsburgh area. I'm not saying that as a knock on all the others; I just love all that Trax has to offer. From wine tastings to hayrides, dreamy fall and winter candles to fresh produce and flowers, Trax really has it all. I think of all the pumpkin patches I've been to in the Pittsburgh area, Trax has the best selection of pumpkins even as Halloween draws closer; I've gone as close as four days before Halloween and still got several pumpkins that I carved. Their pumpkin piles also make for great photo spots (as pictured).
And when the air gets a little too chilly, the inside of Trax features must-sees and must-buys for the whole family. I recommend going early so you can check out the thrift/antique store on the second floor. I also recommend leaving with a giant bag of kettlecorn popcorn to tie you over for the fall months.
Trax also has a Fall Fest filled with activities for the whole family, which you can learn more about here .

Join us on a journey of the relationships between Hollywood actors and Pittsburgh!
Pittsburgh and Hollywood have more in common than you think! Pittsburgh’s movie reputation dates back to 1905 when Nickelodeon, the world’s first modern movie theater, was built in the city. Fast forward to present day where more than 120 motion pictures and tv productions have been filmed in the Pittsburgh area, thanks to the work of the Pittsburgh Film Office . Movies filmed in the ‘Burgh range from Oscar-nominated pieces like Fences to the recent HBO comedy An American Pickle .

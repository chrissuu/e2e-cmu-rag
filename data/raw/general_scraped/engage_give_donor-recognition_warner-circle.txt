The Warner Circle acknowledges our alumni and friends who have made a current life income gift to the university or have named CMU in their estate plans. The members of this society support future generations of students, researchers and scholars through foresight and thoughtful planning. Legacy gifts provide flexibility to donors, allowing them to meet their own financial needs while ensuring a strong future for CMU.
Member benefits include priority communication from university leadership, invitations to special events throughout the year and privacy options to meet your needs (option to remain anonymous or decline to participate in the society).
The university’s fourth president, John C. Warner, who led CMU from 1950 to 1965, lends his name to this recognition society.

Planned gifts are important because they increase Carnegie Mellon’s endowment, ensuring a stable source of income in the future. For more information, visit the Office of Gift Planning website .

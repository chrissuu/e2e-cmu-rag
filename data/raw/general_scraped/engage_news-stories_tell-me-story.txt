Pittsburgh native Meghan Schiller came to Carnegie Mellon to pursue a career on the stage, majoring in vocal performance.
But the 2011 College of Fine Arts graduate also honed many of the skills she needs for a career in television news — one that’s stretched from South Bend, Indiana, to Savannah, Georgia, and back to her hometown on KDKA-TV, where she works as an anchor and investigative reporter.
Meghan’s CMU education taught her poise and confidence, skills she needed to be comfortable on the stage — or, as it turned out, in front of a TV camera. It also gave her something else that carried over from the stage to the small screen: her love of telling a story.
“So I loved the songs and the music that you could tell a story from start to finish with your voice, with your words,” Meghan says. “Then I stumbled upon news where I realized you can use your voice. Maybe you're not singing, but you are telling a story and you're using all of the same presentation and performance aspects that you've learned and honed while in school at Carnegie Mellon. It’s just presented a different way.”

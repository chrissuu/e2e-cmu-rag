There will be no clubhouse tours on Holidays, Sundays when the Pittsburgh Pirates have home games. There will also be no tours in the event of special ballpark activities (such as concerts, festivals, etc.).
Tour highlights may include:
This tour includes a tour of the Pittsburgh Pirates Home Clubhouse, in addition to our normal stops on our walkup tours. All areas are subject to change without notice.
Field/Warning Track, Bullpens, Popâ€™s Plaza, Pittsburgh Baseball Club Level, Premium Suites and Press Box. All areas are subject to change without notice.
For PNC Park Clubhouse Tours, phones and cameras will not be allowed inside of the clubhouse. You must leave it in a bin outside with a PNC Park Tour staff member and collect on your way out of the clubhouse. Refusal to do so will result in you not being able to enter the clubhouse and waiting outside to continue the tour.
PNC Park is now cashless therefore we only accept credit cards, debit cards or gift cards (gift cards will only be accepted for tour ticket purchases.)
Please use the buttons below to check times for available walkup dates and to purchase tickets.

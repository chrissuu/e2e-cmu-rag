Our character is unique among orchestras... inseparable from the city that shaped us.Challenging convention while honoring a proud history. Willingly taking risks for the thrill of achieving something extraordinary. We are Pittsburgh's Symphony. And now, we want to ask: how can those Pittsburgh qualities redefine what an orchestra can be? In the 2025/26 Season, we commemorate the 250* anniversary of our country's founding. We draw upon our rich and storied tradition of performing and celebrating the inventiveness, energy, and diversity of American music. With an array of voices who have defined and shaped the American sound, our season culminates in a two-week festival, America 250.
Book your seats now for this exciting season – which includes masterpieces like Scheherazade, Beethoven’s “Eroica”, The Rite of Spring, and more – along with the hottest talents of the classical music world – including Yuja Wang, LeIla Josefowicz, Emanuel Ax, and others.

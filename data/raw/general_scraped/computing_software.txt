Your Front Door to Software Needs
We want to make sure you have the tools you need to get your work done. Some software at CMU is acquired through software licenses managed by the university. Some enable all faculty, staff, or students to use the software at no cost. Others limit who is eligible to use the software or have a fee. Each licensed product has its eligibility criteria; not all products are licensed at all locations.

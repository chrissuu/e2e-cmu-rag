The Office for Institutional Equity and Title IX (IEX) is dedicated to promoting equity at Carnegie Mellon University, which includes coordinating the University's efforts to prevent and effectively respond to forms of discrimination, bias, and sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, dating and domestic violence, and stalking, which impact community members.
Additionally, the IEX Office addresses reports of bias through the Campus Climate and Bias Protocol, which responds to behaviors that (may) negatively impact campus culture (or climate) but may not require formal university action.
These efforts comply with federal and state civil rights laws, such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act , Title VII of the Civil Rights Act , Title IX of the Education Amendments , the Pennsylvania Human Rights Relations Act , and other applicable federal, state and local anti-discrimination laws, regulations and ordinances. The university ensures compliance with these laws and regulations through implementation of its policies and procedures.
Elizabeth Rosemeyer , Assistant Vice Provost & Title IX Coordinator, serves as both the university’s Title IX Coordinator and Title VI Coordinator.

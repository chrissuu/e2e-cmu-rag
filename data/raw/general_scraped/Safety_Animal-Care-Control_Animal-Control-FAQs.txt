There is no law against cats roaming free in the City of Pittsburgh, but they are required to have a collar with identification. If you have found a friendly cat without identification, animal control officers will pick it up if it is contained in some way (carrier, cage, humane trap). Animal Care and Control is not able to respond to calls regarding loose cats that are not contained. We are able to provide a humane trap for residents needing to capture a cat on their property. Please contact the office at 412-255-2036, Monday through Friday from 7am to 3pm to discuss trapping.

When is the deadline to submit a message?
Submissions must be made at least three (3) days prior to the game of choice. Please note that this means a message for a Saturday or Sunday home game must be reserved no later than the Thursday prior.
Can I get a photo of my message?
Yes! New for the 2025 season, you can purchase a digital photo of your message (see sample photo above) for an additional $10 donation. When submitting your message request, you will be able to select this as an option on the form. Photos will be delivered via email within two (2) weeks of the selected game date.
Why can't I see my preferred game date?
There are a limited number of messages available each game. Once we reach full capacity of messages, the game date will no longer be available.
Are there restrictions on what the message can say?
Messages can be up to sixty characters, including spaces and punctuation. The Pirates reserve the right to edit or refuse any message if necessary. Messages that are obscene, offensive, include foul language or refer negatively to the Pirates or any other Major League Baseball organization will be not accepted. Messages may also not include the name of any MLB player. The message cannot be used for commercial purposes, however, you may welcome a group or company who is attending the game. We are unable to accommodate scoreboard messages with references to professional sports teams outside of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
What happens if my message is not approved?
If your message is not approved to be displayed, your credit card will not be charged, and the transaction will be voided.
What happens if the game is cancelled?
In the event that a game does not reach the end of the 5th inning, our Pirates Charities staff will reach out to offer a message display on a different date, or offer a full refund.

Our journey begins at the Riverwalk, once a more closed off region of the park and expanded in 2022 into a vibrant collection of new concession areas, seating right along the outfield, selfie spots, kids areas and gigantic Pirates bobbleheads of all-time greats.
This revitalization also led to the park infusing this area with authentic Pittsburgh cuisine, partnering with local restaurants to develop next-level ballpark food with Only In Pittsburgh inspiration. Chicken on the Hill (section 144/145) features a menu inspired by Coop de Ville in the Strip District , and Cannonball Burger (section 145/145) features Station in Bloomfield’s creations, transforming this stretch into one of PNC Park’s best food spots.
Jared: The chicken biscuit is messy but so worth it. Grab some extra napkins for this bad boy. The biscuit is buttery and flaky, the house pickle adds the acidity this needs and the breaded chicken itself is perfectly fried with just a hint of heat. This is top tier ballpark eating.
Courtney: The dessert pierogi from Cannonball Burger are unlike anything else in the park! These pillowy pockets have a great sweet cheese filling that keep you going back for bite-after-bite without being overly sweet. This is such a fun treat to snack on chillier days in the park when you're not feeling ice cream.
Bonus Tip: Don’t go back to your seats yet. Enjoy your meal at one of the seats right against the outfield railing for an amazing view of the game while you chow down.

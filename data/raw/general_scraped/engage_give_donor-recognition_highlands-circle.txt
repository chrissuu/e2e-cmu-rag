Evoking Andrew Carnegieâ€™s Scottish homeland, The Highlands Circle acknowledges our donors who contribute $1 million or more to the university over the course of their lifetimes or through their estates.
This prestigious society counts about 200 generous individuals, families, corporations and foundations among its members.
The Highlands Circle members enter into the society by personal invitation of the CMU president. They enjoy the honors and opportunities available to The Dunfermline Circle and The Warner Circle. The Highlands Circle members receive complimentary copies of books, music and other materials produced by individuals of the CMU community through the Great Works program, an exclusive benefit for this society. Members also occasionally receive invitations to local events organized for other donor recognition societies.

In Pittsburgh, my first live musical experiences were as a spectator in 1990’s all-ages clubs, watching hip-hop artists like Strict Flow share the bill with emo bands and space-rockers such as Juliana Theory and New Invisible Joy. I’m now a little past performing regularly myself -- I would most likely be considered a ‘Dad Rocker’ at this point -- but with a bit of distance, I realized that I’ve witnessed entire generations and genres of amazing hometown artists come, grow, sometimes stay, and sometimes move along to other things. Above all else, I’m truly inspired by this continued trend of cross-genre collaboration so celebrated by Pittsburgh’s current crop of musicians, where it’s not uncommon to see an acoustic folk group perform alongside an EDM artist or hip-hop act, all united around a common love of song.

Paul J. Ross Fellow
Before joining the Pittsburgh Symphony, Landon shared his musical talent as a freelance musician in Eastern Michigan and the Chicagoland area. He performed as the 4th horn for the Adrian Symphony Orchestra and as both Principal and 4th horn for the Highland Park Strings Orchestra.

In 2018, Landon established his roots in music education with Adedeji Ogunfolu, former Paul J. Ross fellow, current LA recording artist and member of the Pacific Symphony. Landon earned a Bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 2023, studying under Adam Unsworth and Brian Kennedy, graduating with highest honors and a minor in German. Continuing to grow, Landon is currently pursuing a Master's degree at Northwestern University under the tutelage of the legendary Gail Williams and Jonathan Boen.

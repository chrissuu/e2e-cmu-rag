Once your application has been approved by the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED), your business must contribute to a qualified organization, such as the Frick, within 60 days.  You need to send proof of the contribution to DCED within 90 days of the approval.  The Frick will send you an acknowledgement letter as proof of your contribution, and you are required to send a copy of this letter to DCED.

Creative Team
The marketing creative department is a multi-disciplined, fully-integrated creative team that creates effective, best-in-class, and marketing and communication materials and strategically and efficiently delivers these assets for the continuity of the brand throughout the university. The creative department exists in three teams:
Asset and Content Curation
The asset and content curation team manages platforms and resources that give the university community access to a broad range of assets for their visual and creative needs. We provide curated photo collections, the latest video content, downloadable brand assets including wordmarks, fonts and graphics, and user access to the DAM, our self-service digital asset management system. We manage trademark use agreements, permits for campus entry for filming and photography and likeness waivers, ultimately helping to safeguard our CMU assets and brand.
Design focuses on two areas: central strategic design and partnering with units through our internal agency. Our central strategic design fully supports university initiatives and UCM work, while our internal agency serves partners with CMU communicators and marketers through a charge-back model — specifically selective of assignments that elevate the CMU brand.

The visual storytelling team provides highly visual mediums of video, photo and motion graphics that align to UCM’s strategic initiatives and tell CMU’s story. We promote the CMU brand and raise the university's reputation through visual storytelling; provide photo assets by capturing classrooms, research, campus and lifestyle that are distributed on the DAM; and offer assignment photography for a fee, including events, portraits and requests.

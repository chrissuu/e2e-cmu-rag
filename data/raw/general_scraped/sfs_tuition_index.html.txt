Cost of Attendance
Cost of Attendance is an estimate of expenses while you are enrolled at Carnegie Mellon.
Expenses include direct costs like tuition, fees, housing, and meals, as well as indirect costs like books, transportation, and personal expenses. For indirect expenses, you will not receive a bill from the university, but these out-of-pocket costs are taken into account when determining your eligibility for financial aid. Both direct and indirect costs are considered when CMU determines financial aid offers for students and families.
Undergraduate tuition is set by the Board of Trustees and university leadership. Graduate tuition rates are set by each college or school.

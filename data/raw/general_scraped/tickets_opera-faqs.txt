We’ve got lots of ways to get you tuned in. Try the free Pre-Opera Talks with Kristin Gatch one hour before every curtain at Benedum Center and CAPA Theater performances. You'll hear the story of the opera, some background about the composer, and maybe some behind-the-scenes stories.
Meet the Artists is after each Tuesday performance. Enjoy great coversation as the singers, conductor and General Director Christopher Hahn talk about the production and their experiences. You may be surprised to see how funny and down-to-earth these artists really are.
Can’t wait until showtime? Then tune in to 89.3 FM or visit the WQED-FM website for WQED’s Pittsburgh Opera Preview Show .
Gotta have the information right now? Check out the show page for the opera you’re interested in, and explore! You’ll find the story, music and video, cast biographies, and other features. If that’s still not enough, give us a call during office hours: 412-281-0912, ext. 3.

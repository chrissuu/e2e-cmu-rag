During a Song Shop concert, you bring the snacks and we bring the entertainment at the Bitz Opera Factory. Once a month (excluding January and May) during our season, Pittsburghers and visitors of all ages are invited to enjoy free intimate noontime concerts. Our Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artists perform some of opera’s most popular arias, as well as a mix of Broadway, musical theater and other surprises.
These concerts are a wonderful opportunity for an informal introduction to opera.
Bring a friend and bring a lunch. Guests can even meet the performers after the performances! Doors will open at 11:30am for these live events.
Watch our website and social media for information about upcoming concerts.
Natural Awakenings Magazine is the official media sponsor of Pittsburgh Opera’s Song Shop concerts.

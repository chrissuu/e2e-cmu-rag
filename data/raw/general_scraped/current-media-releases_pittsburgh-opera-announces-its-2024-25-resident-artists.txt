Pittsburgh Opera is proud to announce its stellar class of 2024-25 Resident Artists :
Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program is one of the country's leading training programs for young singers. Over 800 applicants from around the world regularly vie for just a handful of openings.
After completing advanced education such as graduate degrees, Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artists further their careers under the guidance of the opera world's leaders and innovators, including master classes with opera legends. They study languages, diction, movement, and acting, while developing their vocal skills, expanding their repertoire, and performing on stage in Pittsburgh Opera productions.
In addition to singers, Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist program includes a Stage Director position, and new for 2024-25, a pianist position.
Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artists regularly go on to headline at the world's most prestigious opera houses, including the Metropolitan Opera. Emily Richter , a Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist from 2022-2024, was one of just five Grand Finals Winners of this year's Metropolitan Opera Eric and Dominique Laffont Competition.

David and Susan Coulter Welcome Center
The Carnegie Mellon University David and Susan Coulter Welcome Center is a unique destination point for campus visitors as the front door to the university. It serves as the primary hub for campus visits, allowing you to engage with the university's community and learn about CMU's contributions to Pittsburgh and the world. If you're scheduled to take a campus tour, it will start in the Coulter Welcome Center, where you will meet the Tartan Ambassador who will lead you and your group through campus.
In the fall of 2024, School of Design graduate students installed updates to the Coulter Welcome Center that are uniquely CMU, including an interactive miniature "The Fence," paper activity pads to learn about student life and the campus experience, a wall of student projects and more.

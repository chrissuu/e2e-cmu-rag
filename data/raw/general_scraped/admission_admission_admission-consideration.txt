Standardized test scores add to our knowledge of your ability, but we don’t make decisions simply on the basis of test scores alone.
Our testing policy for fall 2026 varies by college/program:
The School of Computer Science will require an SAT or an ACT score.
The College of Fine Arts will remain test optional and continue to require portfolios or auditions.
The following colleges and programs are test flexible* for fall 2026:
College of Engineering
Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences
Heinz College’s Information Systems program
Mellon College of Science
Tepper School of Business
*Test flexible means that you are required to submit test scores in order to complete your application, however, you may choose which type of test(s) you prefer to submit. Acceptable test options include the SAT, ACT, International Baccalaureate (IB) exam (predicted or actual scores), Advanced Placement, Cambridge A-Level (predicted or actual results) and the French Baccalaureate (predicted or actual scores).

Please also note that submission of any prior SAT Subject Test results won’t be considered in our admission review process.

Arts Pass
All graduate and undergraduate CMU students have free access to eight Pittsburgh venues with their Carnegie Mellon ID. In order to be eligible, you must be enrolled in classes and your primary affiliation must be “student”.
At this time, faculty, staff and sponsored guests, in addition to recent CMU graduates, are not eligible for the Art Pass program.
Please be sure to check the museums' websites before planning your trip to learn the most up-to-date information regarding current hours of operation and ticketing procedures.

The Impact of Empact
Some of Rubini’s favorite work happens at Empact.
She launched Empact’s first two pilot projects — a storytelling and crowdfunding platform for nonprofits to build recurring donors and a social mobilization platform that offered virtual volunteer matching for organizations — as part of her Fulbright Scholarship. She also received grants through the Vital Voices x Tresseme Women's Leadership Incubator and the AerieREAL Changemakers program.
The projects were rewarding, but came with their own set of challenges.
“Entrepreneurship is hard, but when it’s combined with a social mission and is dealing with real communities and real stories and people's personal experiences, as their own change makers, I think it becomes more complicated,” she says.
Rubini let the dust settle on those projects before rekindling her work at Empact in 2023. She’s excited to see it grow and evolve.
“Currently, Empact is about holding space for the intersection of social justice and inner healing, because typically these tend to live in their own spaces,” Rubini says. “I realized how the two go hand in hand and by holding space for both, people can show up as their full selves and be on this journey together.”
Empact sponsors virtual events and group discussions and will start holding in-person events this year. Rubini also hopes to create an Empact studio where she and her team can work with communities and organizations to share their stories and produce content that brings broader awareness to social issues.

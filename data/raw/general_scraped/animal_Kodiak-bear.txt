Kodiak bear ,  (subspecies Ursus arctos middendorffi ),  subspecies of brown bear found only on Kodiak Island and nearby islands off the coast of Alaska . It can weigh up to 720 kg (1,600 pounds) and is the world’s largest bear and the world’s largest land carnivore , titles it shares with the polar bear ( Ursus maritimus ), which grows to a similar size. Researchers estimate that the Kodiak bear population numbers about 3,500 animals.
Kodiak bears are sometimes called grizzlies, due to superficial physical similarities with grizzly bears ( Ursus arctos horribilis ). However, Kodiak bears are larger than grizzly bears, and the ranges of these two subspecies do not overlap. Scientists note that Kodiak bears have been reproductively isolated from grizzlies and other bears for about 12,000 years.

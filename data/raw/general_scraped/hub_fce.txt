Faculty Course Evaluations (FCEs)
Purpose
Faculty Course Evaluations (FCEs) are used to improve the quality of teaching and learning at Carnegie Mellon through feedback to both individual faculty members and promotion committees.
Responses to the FCE provide information on students' perceptions of their engagement, learning outcomes, the instructor's behavior and course activities. This feedback will help guide changes in future iterations of the course and/or the instructor's teaching.
Responses also serve as one measure of the quality of faculty member's teaching that is used to evaluate faculty for promotion and tenure.
Statement on Faculty Course Evaluation
Students play an integral role in the academic life of the university through their participation in the evaluation of the faculty through the Faculty Course Evaluation process.Â  FCE data serve an important role in the evaluation of teaching and learning, as an important piece of the promotion and tenure process, and as part of the process of course design and improvement. Student participation in the FCE process is critical to the university's commitment to quality teaching and academic excellence. Students are strongly encouraged to participate in the process with constructive feedback that is relevant to teaching and course content.

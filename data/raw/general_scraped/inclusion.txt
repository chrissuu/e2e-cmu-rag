The Frick Pittsburgh is committed to inclusively serving our community—visitors, staff, artists, scholars, educational partners, and neighbors. Core to the mission, the Frick offers authentic experiences with art, history, and nature.
The Frick will work to create an inclusive and enlivened creative space by:
Featuring a varied representation of art, artifacts, and artists in our galleries with specific focus on those historically marginalized by museums;
Broadening the scope of historical narratives presented by inviting new voices and engaging multiple perspectives;
Interpreting inclusive historical narratives relevant in the context of the Frick legacy, Pittsburgh, and the Industrial Age with critical reflection, honesty, and transparency;
Engaging artists, performers, scholars, and community partners in educational and public programming that explores an array of cultural experiences and intellectual inquiries;
Addressing the physical, mental, and emotional needs of our audiences, employees, and neighbors;
Ensuring fairness in employment and advancement and fair compensation and professional development;
Engaging our staff and board in regular education and self-reflection.
Since completing and assessing our goals for our previous strategic plan, The Frick Pittsburgh will create the next strategic plan in 2025-2026 to build on our work and continue progress in our goals. The Frick Pittsburgh occupies ancestral lands of the Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Osage, and Shawnee peoples. As a place of history and nature, the Frick recognizes the cultural importance of land and the role of cultural institutions in the formation of collective memory. Displacement and erasure are not just histories for native peoples. Land acknowledgements, like historic sites themselves, are exercises in preservation and reconciliation, engaged with past, present, and future.

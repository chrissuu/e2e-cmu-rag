TUESDAY Glendale @ Salt River, 4:30 p.m. ET The second day of Arizona Fall League action begins with some serious pop as Rockies 2024 first-round pick Charlie Condon ( No. 61 on the Top 100 ) leads Salt River. On the other side, White Sox No. 11 prospect Sam Antonacci teams up with Blue Jays No. 12 Josh Kasevich for Glendale.
Surprise @ Mesa, 9:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Daniel Espino ( CLE No. 29 ) vs. Bryce Cunningham ( NYY No. 5 )
WEDNESDAY Peoria @ Mesa, 4:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Luis De León ( BAL No. 21 ) vs. Koen Moreno (CHC)
Glendale @ Surprise, 9:30 p.m. ET The Fall League's top-ranked lefty -- White Sox prospect Hagen Smith ( MLB No. 88 ) -- takes the hill for Glendale and he'll be backed up by a pair of Top 100 prospects in the Dodgers' Josue De Paula ( No. 13 ) and fellow South Sider Braden Montgomery ( No. 35 ). The trio has a tall task against them with a Surprise infield that contains three Top 100 prospects as well: Texas' Sebastian Walcott (No. 6 ), Philadelphia's Aidan Miller ( No. 32 ) and Kansas City's Blake Mitchell ( No. 62 ).
Salt River @ Scottsdale, 9:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Jojo Ingrassia (BOS) vs. Pablo Aldonis (WSH)
THURSDAY Surprise @ Peoria, 4:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Eiberson Castellano ( PHI No. 24 ) vs. Johnathan Harmon (CIN)
Mesa @ Salt River, 4:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Corey Avant (ATH) vs. David Hagaman (TEX)
Scottsdale @ Glendale, 9:30 p.m. ET You don't want to miss the highest-ranked prospect in the Fall League since Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was No. 1 in 2018, as Kevin McGonigle ( MLB No. 2 ) leads the Scorpions offense against Cardinals No. 16 prospect Chen-Wei Lin and a pair of heavy hitters in Josue De Paula ( No. 13 ) and Braden Montgomery ( No. 35 ) for the Desert Dogs.
FRIDAY Salt River @ Peoria, 4:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Ryan Costeiu (LAA) vs. TBD
Surprise @. Glendale, 4:30 p.m. ET The Braves selected Luke Sinnard in the third-round of last year's Draft despite the 6-foot-8 righty missing that season after undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2023. Atlanta's No. 16 prospect is healthy again and made 17 starts across two levels of A ball this season. He'll look to carry that momentum into the fall circuit for Surprise against a potent Glendale lineup that is anchored by Josue De Paula ( MLB No. 13 ) and Braden Montgomery ( MLB No. 35 )
Mesa @ Scottsdale, 9:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Aiden May (MIA) vs. Anderson Brito ( HOU No. 7 )
SATURDAY Salt River @ Surprise, 3:30 p.m. ET Jose Corniell ( TEX No. 3 ) battled injuries this season that limited him to 38 innings across three levels of the Minors, still, he showed enough to earn his call to The Show late in the year and made his MLB debut on Sept. 28. for the Rangers. He'll look to make up for lost time in the desert with the Saguaros alongside Texas' Sebastian Walcott (MLB No. 6 ), Philadelphia's Aidan Miller ( MLB No. 32 ) and Kansas City's Blake Mitchell ( MLB No. 62 ) against the Rockies' Charlie Condon ( MLB No. 61 ) and the Rafters.
Mesa @ Peoria, 6:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Cade Smith ( NYY No. 19 ) vs. TBD
Scottsdale @ Glendale, 9:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Kenny Serwa (DET) vs. Hyun-Seok Jang ( LAD No. 21 )
SUNDAY Surprise @ Glendale, 4:30 p.m. ET Probable starters: Daniel Espino ( CLE No. 29 ) vs. Jakob Wright ( LAD No. 28 )
Salt River @ Mesa, 4:30 p.m. ET A combination of the pandemic, injuries and getting handled with care, limited Luis Perales to just 127 1/3 innings in his first four years as a pro, but that hasn't stopped him from climbing Boston's ranks. The Red Sox No. 9 prospect only made three appearances this season after recovering from Tommy John surgery, but his final two came at the Minors' highest level with Worcester. He'll now take the ball in the desert for Salt River -- with Colorado's Charlie Condon ( MLB No. 61 ) backing him up -- and aim to get his career on track against righty Jackson Baumeister ( TB No. 21 ) and Mesa.
Peoria @ Scottsdale, 8 p.m. ET Probable starters: TBD vs. Sean Paul Liñan ( WSH No. 14 )

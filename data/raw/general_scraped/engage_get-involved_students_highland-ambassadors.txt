The Highland Ambassadors program is a vital part of creating and maintaining an engaged student-alumni community at Carnegie Mellon.
These involved student leaders are the bridge between current students and alumni, serving as advisors, advocates, event support and marketers for Alumni Association initiatives. Highland Ambassadors are undergraduate and graduate students with representation across all schools and colleges.
Highland Ambassadors are chosen for their enthusiasm and school spirit as well as their demonstrated leadership and commitment to the university.

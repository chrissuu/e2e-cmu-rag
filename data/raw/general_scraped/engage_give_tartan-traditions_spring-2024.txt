Carnegie Mellon University alumnus Richard Glave is maximizing his support for future generations of Tartans with a tax-smart gift of retirement funds.
After graduating from Carnegie Mellon University and starting his first Job, Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences alumnus Richard Glave’s father encouraged him to set up a retirement account.
“My father, Harold Glave, was a big saver and investor,” Richard says. “He was very big on retirement plans and pensions and all of that. He managed retirement plans for companies at Bankers Trust, now part of Deutsche Bank, for around 25 years.”
His father’s forethought and a diligent dedication to stashing funds for a post-career life have allowed Richard to create a legacy at Carnegie Mellon University with a planned gift intention through his retirement plan.

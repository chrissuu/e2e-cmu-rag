Artist Designed Bike Racks
Multiple Artists, 2014
In 2014, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust commissioned a suite of 11 artist‑designed bike racks that marry everyday functionality with compelling artistic expression. Installed along Penn Avenue (from 7th to 10th Streets) and Liberty Avenue, these racks are crafted from durable materials such as stainless and galvanized steel, ensuring both longevity and low maintenance. Each rack serves a dual purpose: a secure docking point for bicycles and a distinct sculptural landmark. Highlights include:
Stephen House ’s Persistence of Bicycling, with one wheel styled as a clock—an ode to Pittsburgh’s terrain and a meditation on journey times.
Myra Falisz ’s Time‑Travelin’ Mike, inspired by wristwatches and 19th‑century wonder tales, paying tribute to her steelworker father and the city’s industrial roots.
Brandon Boan ’s Hot Pants, a visual echo of thermal imaging traces taken around downtown, tracing urban heat patterns in metal form.
Robert Raczka ’s A Fence, which echoes the wrought‑iron fences of Pittsburgh’s historical core, linking function with the city’s heritage.
Alanna James ’ Sprouting Tree, and Finnbogi Petursson’s River, both poetic abstractions referencing nature and the region’s riverscape.
The complete roster of contributing artists includes:

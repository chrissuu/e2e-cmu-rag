Carnegie Mellon Application Status
The Where Am I in the Process? portal allows you to track the Carnegie Mellon application and admission process online. You can see what admission and financial aid documents we've received, what documents we've mailed to you and what documents we're missing.
We also post admission decisions and financial aid offers to your Where Am I in the Process? portal, so review the Terms of Service prior to applying. The Where Am I in the Process? service is intended for individuals at least 13 years old; if you intend to apply and are not at least 13, please contact the Office of Admission .
After you've completed your portal registration, we encourage you to review your information to confirm that information is accurate.
In the portal, you're able to edit your:
Preferred name
Permanent address
Mailing address
Mobile phone number
Email address
You can also confirm that your application plan and college choice(s) are correct. If either piece of information is incorrect, please contact the Office of Admission to make an update.

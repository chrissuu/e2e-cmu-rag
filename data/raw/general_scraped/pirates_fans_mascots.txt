Introduced in 1979, The Pirate Parrot is the popular costumed mascot of the Pirates. He entertains the crowds at all Pirates home games by dancing, interacting with fans -- young and old --- and leading cheers. In addition, The Parrot often appears at events and fundraisers throughout the region, as well as Pirates team functions.

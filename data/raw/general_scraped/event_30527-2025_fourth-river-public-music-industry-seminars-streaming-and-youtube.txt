Disentangling the world of the algorithm — and stepping completely outside of it. DSPs or (Digital Streaming Platforms) are the main way the public consumes music. Here we’ll talk about how to pitch for playlists, ways to work the algorithms to your advantage, and the merits of platforms like Bandcamp which operate completely differently. Guest speakers: Ashraf El Gamal (YouTube Music) and J. Edward Keyes (Editorial Director, Bandcamp).
Fourth River, a collaboration between Honcho PGH and The Rising Artist Foundation, is proud to present our FREE Public Music Industry Seminars, every Saturday from Oct. 11 to Nov. 15 at Wood Street Galleries. Named in homage to the city's underground, essential aquifer, this program will help artists nourish and navigate their creative careers with clarity. Each week, we'll present different topics with leading guest speakers to help demystify the music industry for rising music makers.
Advance RSVP via Resident Advisor is required to attend.

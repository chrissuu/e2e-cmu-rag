Ring Pittsburgh was founded in 2016 as an auditioned community of musicians skilled in the art of handbell ringing. This unique ensemble takes a musical art form found mainly in church and worship settings and translates it to a professional concert setting. The seasoned ringers educate and entertain audiences across southwestern Pennsylvania and seek to advance the knowledge and awareness of the art of handbell ringing.

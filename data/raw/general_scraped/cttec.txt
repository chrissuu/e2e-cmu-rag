"In the end, the inventor is still the hero and always will be."
The founder of Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Technology Transfer and Enterprise Creation (CTTEC) , Benno Bernt, made this declaration in 1993, and it continues to guide our efforts every day.
CTTEC is responsible for facilitating and accelerating the movement of research and technology out of the university and into the marketplace.Â Our collaborative and problem-solving approach working with researchers to validate, challenge and extend their work fits well within the overall goals of commercialization.
We are inspired by the passion of our inventors , and we strive to connect them with the right resources to bring our technologies to market. In this website you will find all of the information you will need to begin working with us today.

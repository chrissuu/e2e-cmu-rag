Pittsburgh Connections
Pittsburgh Connections engages students in outdoor recreation and cultural awareness throughout Pittsburgh and the Western Pennsylvania region, with the goals of helping students develop and maintain a physically active lifestyle, build leadership skills and increase their appreciation of the region.
Throughout the academic year, Pittsburgh Connections sponsors outdoor adventures to one of the many parks or outdoor recreation facilities in the Pittsburgh area. Past adventure trips include whitewater rafting, kayaking, biking, hiking, paintball, horseback riding, and more!
Tickets are subsidized and available to both graduate and undergraduate students on the Pittsburgh Connections TartanConnect page .

Before you head out on your river trek, be sure you know your rivers. The Allegheny (pronunciations phonetically below) divides Downtown and the Northside of the city, the Monongahela (you can always just call this The Mon and sound like a local) divides Downtown and the Southside, and the Ohio starts where the other two meet at the Point. Now, try guessing how we pronounce North Versailles.
Allegheny - AL - UH - GAY - KNEE

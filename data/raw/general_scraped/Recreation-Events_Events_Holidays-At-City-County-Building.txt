PITTSBURGH'S OFFICIAL CHRISTMAS TREE
Pittsburgh's official Christmas Tree was first erected at the construction site of the City-County Building in 1915.  For more than a century, a beautiful live evergreen (the only live holiday tree Downtown) has graced the front steps of our seat of government.  Visitors enjoy hundreds of larger-than-life ornaments, including Pittsburgh’s Coat of Arms designed by Wendell August Forge, and 90 distinct ornaments, each bearing the name of Pittsburgh's beloved neighborhoods.  Be sure to spot your favorite!

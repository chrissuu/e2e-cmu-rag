Our members are a diverse network of stakeholders who share in our vision for Downtown and the region as a whole.
From the ever-expanding popularity of Picklesburgh, to the bustling outdoor dining scene, to dedicated services that keep our streets safe and clean, our mission is to foster a Downtown that is welcoming to all, and our members are vital part of everything we do.

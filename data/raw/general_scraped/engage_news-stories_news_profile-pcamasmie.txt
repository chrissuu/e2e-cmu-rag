Pedaling a New Path
Paulo founded Catrike in 2000. He and his family had just moved to the U.S. from Brazil, so that he could start a bike company.
He had no prior knowledge of the industry, and many people questioned his decision.
“Everyone thought I was crazy in Brazil,” Paulo says. “We left everything behind. All we took with us were five pieces of luggage and our educations.”
The move was difficult, but it was the right choice for Paulo, his wife, Rafaela, and their children, who were ages 1 and 2 at the time.
Paulo received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from FAAP in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1992. He completed a five-month internship at Chrysler in Detroit and returned to Brazil to start his own import and export company. The business was successful, but Paulo felt out of his element and unchallenged by the work.
“I had this desire to go back to using my engineering skills,” Paulo says. “I wanted to explore my full potential.”
While out for a stroll in Sao Paulo with his daughter, he had an epiphany.
“I was dealing with noise, potholes and pollution during the walk, and I thought that we should leave Brazil, even if it was only for a few years,” Paulo says.
When they returned to their building, Paulo noticed a beautiful bike in the building’s garage.
“That’s when I had the epiphany that I could make bikes for a living,” he says. “I knew I could create an ultra-comfortable and innovative bike with a minimalist design.”
He told Rafaela to go look at the bike.
“When she asked me what I was thinking about, I said ‘We can move to the U.S., and I can start a bike company,’” Paulo says.
She was on board, and they were off.

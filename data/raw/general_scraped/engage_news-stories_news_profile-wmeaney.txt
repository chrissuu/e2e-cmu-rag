Energetic, enthusiastic and endlessly curious, Carnegie Mellon University alumnus William Meaney has always loved a challenge — and the more complex, the better.
During his noteworthy career, the Tepper School of Business Class of 1986 graduate spent 27 years successfully consulting for, leading and turning around companies overseas.
Most recently, as CEO of Portsmouth, New Hampshire-based Iron Mountain, a global leader in innovative storage, data center, asset life cycle management and information management services, William has led the organization to impressive growth and transformation.
“I like businesses that are at inflection points — from huge turnarounds to managing growth spurts,” he says. “It adds a level of adrenaline to the situation.”
Since he took the helm, Iron Mountain’s annual growth has increased from under 2% to more than 14% while share price has nearly doubled. Today, he runs the S&P 500 company with more than 26,000 “Mountaineers” across 60 countries serving more than 225,000 customers.
As a young man with math and science talent, William was encouraged to pursue engineering by his father, who had been a U.S. Marine. The New Hampshire native took the advice and headed to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute — and into Marine Corps ROTC. After graduation (and to his father’s dismay), he turned down a lucrative engineering offer to join the CIA in paramilitary or special operations.
“It was another way to serve,” William explains. “I loved it. I mean, the work and mission were fantastic. It was a true honor to be able to serve our country in such a capacity.”

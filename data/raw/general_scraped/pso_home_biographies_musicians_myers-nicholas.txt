Nicholas Myers
Principal Bass
Nicholas Myers was honored to be appointed Principal Bass of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra by music director Manfred Honeck in 2022. Hailing from Cadillac, MI, Nick spent four seasons playing in the bass section of his home stateâ€™s Detroit Symphony Orchestra, which he joined in 2018 after his final year of graduate school. Recognizing the importance of musician representation, he was part of almost every elected committee in Detroit, and in his second season with the PSO he began serving on the Orchestra Committee. Nicholas is a Pirastro Strings artist, and performs in the orchestra on a full-size 1836 Abraham Prescott (Concord, NH) double bass.
Nick attained his high school diploma from Interlochen Arts Academy, his Bachelor of Music degree from New England Conservatory, and his Master of Music degree from The Juilliard School, where he was a proud recipient of a Kovner Fellowship. He considers himself very fortunate to have studied with primary teachers Lawrence Wolfe, Todd Seeber, Rex Surany, and Hal Robinson, being exposed to a broad variety of musical styles and philosophies. In between the school years, Nick had two meaningful summers each at the Pacific Music Festival, Music Academy of the West, and the Tanglewood Music Center.
Nick and his wife live in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh and love to explore the unique flavor of each distinct neighborhood of the city. In his free time, Nick enjoys cycling, learning patience through golf, DIY projects and woodworking, reading histories, and cooking.

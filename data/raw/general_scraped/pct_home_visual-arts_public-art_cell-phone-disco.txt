Cell Phone Disco
Commissioned by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Cell Phone Disco is Pittsburgh’s first outdoor, art science interactive installation. Cell Phone Disco visualizes the electromagnetic field of an active mobile phone. A giant, 16 by 16 foot light screen receives electromagnetic data from a receiver that continuously scans cell phone usage through 16 antennas. The data is fed to eight processors that are embedded in the digital display, illuminating 2,034 individually controlled LED lights in an unprecedented pattern.
The Trust commissioned the Netherlands-based artist collective, Informationlab (Auke Touwslager, Ursula Lavrencic) and engineers Aleš Vrhovec, Janez Jazbar and Robert Unetich to create this unique installation. Cell Phone Disco is located at Tito Way and Exchange Way and is free and open to the public. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust thanks The Fine Foundation for its support of Cell Phone Disco .

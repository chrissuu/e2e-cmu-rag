Undergraduate Student Senate
The Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Student Senate is the undergraduate component of Carnegie Mellon's Student Government Legislative Branch.  We are composed of student-elected representatives that represent the unique and diverse culture of our university. Elected representatives from each Carnegie Mellon college meet on a weekly basis to discuss rising issues on our campus.
To check out our current initiatives and help make a difference, visit our initiatives page. If you're interested in joining Senate (as a Senator or Member-at-Large), check out our get involved page.
All Undergraduate Student Senate General Body Meetings (GBMs) are open to the entire campus community, so please come join us-- food is provided! GBMs are held, during the regular academic year, every Thursday from 5:20 to 6:30 pm in the UC Danforth Conference Room. We also hold weekly committee meetings that handle specific initiatives, the times of which are posted under the committees page.
Have an idea?  We want to hear about it!
Tell us about your ideas or any kind of improvements or initiatives you'd like to see on campus! Please reach out to one of your college's representatives , check out our committees page, or just email us at student-senate@andrew.cmu.edu to connect!

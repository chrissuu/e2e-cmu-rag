Magnolias for Pittsburgh
Tony Tasset, 2006
Situated at the corner of 7th and Penn Avenues—once the site of the infamous Doc Johnson’s International House of Love Potions and Marital Aids—the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust transformed this location into the 7th and Penn Parklet in 1992. Serving as an intimate urban oasis, the parklet features a rotating selection of distinguished public artworks curated by the Trust, embodying its mission to revitalize Downtown Pittsburgh through exceptional design and art.
The current installation, Magnolias for Pittsburgh by renowned artist Tony Tasset, exemplifies the power of public art to engage and enrich community spaces. This elegant composition pairs two large-scale bronze magnolia trees with five live magnolias, thoughtfully integrated within a serene landscape design. The juxtaposition of enduring bronze forms alongside living trees creates a dialogue between permanence and growth, artifice and nature, inviting contemplation and interaction within the parklet’s intimate setting.
Past notable installations at the 7th and Penn Parklet include Alexandr Brodsky’s Palazzo Nudo , the collaborative Labyrinth by James O. Loney and David A. Ludwig, Franz West’s sculptures, and Takamasa Kuniyasu’s Season in Spiral , each contributing to the parklet’s legacy as a dynamic platform for world-class public art.

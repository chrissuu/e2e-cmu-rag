Schoolhouse.world Mastery Certifications
As part of our partnership with Khan Academy (opens in new window) , Carnegie Mellon will consider a Schoolhouse.world portfolio as part of its holistic undergraduate admissions review process. This allows applicants to demonstrate not only subject mastery in areas like math and science, but also their commitment to peer learning and service.
Additionally, students who earn certifications through Schoolhouse.world are eligible to take placement exams in foundational STEM topics at CMU, such as biology, chemistry, physics, calculus and computer science. Those who pass have the option to take more advanced courses.
What is schoolhouse.world?
Schoolhouse.world is a free, globally accessible platform founded by Sal Khan, creator of Khan Academy. It enables students to demonstrate subject mastery and tutor peers in subjects like calculus, statistics, computer science, and more.
Why Submit a Certification?
While Schoolhouse.world certifications do not replace official application materials like transcripts or letters of recommendation, they can help improve your application by:
Highlighting your academic strengths
Demonstrating initiative and subject mastery
Showing readiness in topics not available at your school
These certifications are a great way to stand out and help us better understand your academic journey.

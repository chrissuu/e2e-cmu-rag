Who We Are
Formed by Downtown businesses, professionals, civic organizations, foundations, and residents, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (PDP) is a non-profit community development organization that develops and implements innovative programs and initiatives to enhance the Downtown neighborhood, cultivate a vibrant residential population, and stimulate a diverse retail community.
We also promote and market this great urban center to millions of people as the region’s premier destination to do business, to call home, or to visit for the best in shopping, dining, and entertainment. The PDP stands as staunch advocates for all those who make Downtown part of their lives—from businesses to workers to residents and visitors.

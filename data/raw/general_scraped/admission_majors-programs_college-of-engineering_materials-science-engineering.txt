Materials Science & Engineering
Nearly all technology — whether brand new or well-established — depends on materials development and innovation. Understanding the behavior of metals, polymers, ceramics and composites is critical to design the future. From advancing toward 3D bioprinting of a replacement human heart to developing a substitute material for an endangered wood used in the musical instrument called the marimba, materials engineers are literally making the future. These makers and dreamers manipulate the connection between processing, structure and properties of materials to engineer materials that fit the performance criteria for specific uses. As a graduate, you can work at companies, universities or national laboratories, focusing on areas like microelectronics, energy production and storage, biomedical applications, aerospace, information technology, nanotechnology, manufacturing and materials production.

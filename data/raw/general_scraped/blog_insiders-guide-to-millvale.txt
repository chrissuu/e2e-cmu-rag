When I moved to Millvale a little over 4 years ago, I was mainly excited for the affordable rent and easy commute to the city. Little did I know, within those 4 years, I would fall in love with the town and the community surrounding it. I think a lot of people overlook Millvale due to its reputation in the past, but as a Millvale resident, I can full-heartedly say that this little town has more than meets the eye.

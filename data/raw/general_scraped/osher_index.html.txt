5050: SIG - Canasta
Osher at CMU Woo-Hoo: Come play canasta on Friday afternoons with your Osher at CMU friends!
A year ago one of our members set out to start a Canasta SIG in our lounge.  Eight showed up the first day and by word of mouth the group is now at 36 and growing.  If you don't know how to play, it doesn't matter because everyone is eager to coach you into becoming a competitive player.  It has become a fun way to meet other Osher at CMU members and to spend a Friday afternoon.

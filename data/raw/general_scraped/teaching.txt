The Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence & Educational Innovation integrates pedagogical, technological, and research expertise to support Carnegie Mellon University educators of all experience levels via evidence-based practice.
Site Restructure: To better support your teaching needs, we are reorganizing the site to focus on the way you teach and what you need. We are removing unnecessary distinctions between audiences and grouped content around participating in professional development programs, requesting expert support, and finding practical resources. We invite you to reach out with suggestions as we continue to grow this resource together.

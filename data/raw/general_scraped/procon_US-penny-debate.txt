Although the U.S. penny was one of the first coins produced by the U.S. Mint after its founding in 1792, the coin has roots in ancient history. It was indirectly based on the Roman denarius, a  coin introduced in 211 bce that was worth a laborer’s daily wages; the coin’s name stemmed from the Latin term “deni,” meaning “containing ten.”  The coin ceased circulation during reign of Emperor Gordian III (238–244 ce ). The French Carolingian King Pippin III (751-768 ce ) revived the coin as the novus denarius , which was commonly called a “penny” or “denier.” In the late 8th century, the British translated the penny into a small silver Anglo-Saxon coin. As a former British colony , the United States adopted the penny when the country established its federal currency . [43] [44]
The U.S. Congress established a U.S. Mint in Philadelphia with the Coinage Act of 1792 . The next year, on March 1, the mint produced the country’s first circulating coins: 11,178 copper cents, or the penny. [42]
According to the U.S. Mint, the new coins “caused a bit of a public outcry. They were larger than a modern quarter, a bulky size for small change. The image of Liberty on the obverse [heads side] showed her hair steaming behind her and her expression ‘in a fright.’ The reverse [tails side] featured a chain of 15 links, similar to the Fugio cent . However, some people felt that it symbolized slavery instead of unity of the states. The Mint quickly replaced the chain with a wreath, and a couple months later designed a new version of Liberty.” An image of President Abraham Lincoln replaced Liberty on the obverse of the penny in 1909, making the 16th president the first chief executive to grace an American coin. [42]
In 1857, Congress, facing rising copper prices, made the penny smaller and stopped minting the half cent, the latter being unpopular with Americans. The discontinuation of the half cent makes the penny the only American coin to have been continuously minted and circulated since the creation of the U.S. Mint. [42]
A few members of the British Commonwealth — Australia , Canada , and New Zealand —have phased out their one-cent pieces, though the United Kingdom has retained their “one penny” coin. [2]
The U.S. Mint produces coins as instructed by the U.S. Congress , so for pennies to be removed from circulation a law would have to be passed by Congress and signed by the president. Though the Treasury could simply stop minting the coins. Several unsuccessful legislative efforts have sought to kill the penny. In 2017, for example, Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Mike Enzi (R-WY) sponsored the Currency Optimization, Innovation, and National Savings Act , which ultimately failed but would have suspended minting of the penny for 10 years while the Government Accountability Office studied whether the change could be made permanent. [4] [5]
According to the U.S. Mint’s annual report, the cost of producing its coins increased for all denominations in 2024. “The penny’s unit cost [for producing one coin] increased 20.2 percent, the nickel’s unit cost increased by 19.4 percent, the dime’s unit cost increased by 8.7 percent, and the quarter-dollar’s unit cost increased by 26.2 percent,” it reported. “The unit cost for [producing] pennies (3.69 cents) and nickels (13.78 cents) remained above face value for the 19th consecutive fiscal year.” Pennies still account for a larger share of circulating coins than any other U.S. coin. [40] [41] [47]
On Jan. 21, 2025, Donald Trump ’s first full day in office of his second term as president , his new cost-savings office called DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) highlighted the high cost of producing the coin. As DOGE posted on X , “The penny [whose value is one cent ] costs over 3 cents to make and cost US taxpayers over $179 million in FY [fiscal year] 2023. The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced.” The question hinted at by the post was obvious: given the high cost of producing the penny, and the infrequent use of the coin in society today, should the country simply eliminate it? Trump took a step in this direction in February, when he ordered the U.S. Treasury to stop minting new pennies. [47] [48]
The U.S. Treasury Department announced it had placed the last order for blank pennies in May 2025, which is the first step in phasing-out minting the one-cent coins. The more than $1 billion in pennies currently in circulation (and the last new pennies minted) will remain in circulation. However, given fewer than one in five payments are made in cash and pennies are much more likely to be lost in couch cushions than used for transactions, pennies are likely to continue to fade from circulation more quickly than the official phase-out. [49] [50] [51]
So, should the U.S. penny stay in circulation?
Pro 1: Preserving the penny keeps consumer prices down and avoids harming low-income households.
Mark Weller, executive director of the pro-penny group Americans for Common Cents, says, “The alternative to the penny is rounding to the nickel, and that’s something that will negatively impact working families every time they buy a gallon of gas or a gallon of milk.” [6]
The U.S. Federal Reserve found that minorities and low-income people are more likely to use cash than credit cards. Raymond Lombra, professor of economics at Pennsylvania State University, says the extra rounding charges would exceed $600 million annually and would “be regressive, affecting the poor and other disadvantaged people groups disproportionately.” [7] [9]
One study found that penny rounding in Canada costs grocery store customers an estimated 3.27 million Canadian dollars (2.5 million USD) annually. [9]
As Forbes reported in a 2025 article titled “Is Eliminating The Penny Equitable?,” “only 7% of U.S. transactions are made with cash, so the group that doesn’t have access to credit or digital platforms will be the ones who are affected” if the penny is eliminated. [52]
Pro 2: A penny can be used for decades and is more cost-efficient to produce than a nickel.
Most U.S. coins have an expected circulation life of 20 to 30 years, meaning a single penny could be used thousands or even millions of times. So what if it costs more to make the coins than the coins’ face value? That’s a bargain for how many times it gets used. [1] [10] [11]
Without pennies, the Mint would be forced to make and ship more five-cent pieces. That would cost millions more annually than it would cost to keep making pennies. [1] [12] [13]
Pro 3: Pennies raise money for charities.
Organizations such as the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the Salvation Army, and the Ronald McDonald House ask people to donate pennies to raise funds. In 2009 the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society announced that school children had collected over 15 billion pennies in support of its charitable work—that’s $150 million dollars for blood cancer research and treatment. [11] [14]
Dagmar Serota, who created a nonprofit called Good Cents for Oakland, said, “Pennies are easy to ask for and they are easy to give. And it’s very easy for a child to say, ‘Will you help me support this nonprofit, will you give me your pennies?’” Elementary school students in Los Angeles gain significant leadership and civic engagement experience from the University of Southern California’s Penny Harvest program by choosing how to donate the money they raise. [6] [15]
Common Cents, a nonprofit based in Dallas, has run a “Pennies from the Heart” program for 20 years, and the student-led efforts have raised over $850,000 for local charities. The Ms. Cheap Penny Drive for Second Harvest in Tennessee raised enough to pay for 316,039 meals for the hungry in 2017. [16] [17]
Con 1: The penny has practically no value and should be taken out of circulation just as other coins have been in U.S. history.
You can’t buy anything for a penny; vending machines and parking meters won’t accept them.  Harvard University economist Greg Mankiw stated, “The purpose of the monetary system is to facilitate exchange. The penny no longer serves that purpose. When people start leaving a monetary unit at the cash register for the next customer, the unit is too small to be useful.” Former U.S. Mint director Philip Diehl said, “[T]he value of a penny has shrunk to the point that, if you earn more than the minimum wage, you’re losing money stopping and picking up a penny on the sidewalk.” [18] [19] [20]
Comedian John Oliver noted, “Two percent of Americans admitted to regularly throwing pennies in the garbage, which means the U.S. Mint is spending millions to make garbage.” Two-thirds of the billions of pennies produced are never seen in circulation again once they reach a consumer via the bank. [21] [22]
Con 2: The process of making pennies is costly both financially and environmentally.
In 2024, it cost 3.69 cents to mint one penny, which was the 19th consecutive year that it cost more to make the coin than the coin’s face value. Nickels cost a whopping 13.78 cents to produce. According to Fortune magazine, producing these two coins cost the U.S. Mint $179 million in 2023. Producing the penny alone “cost taxpayers $250,000,000 over the past two years,” reported Forbes in 2025. [1] [23] [52]
Making pennies also has environmental consequences from mining and transportation. Mining zinc and copper produces carbon dioxide emissions and pollutants and uses vast amounts of energy. [24]
Over the last 35 years, 107 million pounds of carbon dioxide have been emitted due to pennies being delivered from the Mint to banks. A California company called Mike’s Bikes has banned the penny from its registers because “making pennies wastes natural resources [and] is toxic to people and the environment.” [25] [26]
Con 3: Eliminating pennies would save time at the point of purchase without hurting customers or charities while saving the country millions of dollars.
The use of pennies in paying for goods and making change adds time to sales transactions. A study by Walgreens and the National Association of Convenience Stores found that pennies add 2 to 2.5 seconds to each cash transaction. [27]
As a result of that extra time per transaction, the average citizen wastes 730 seconds a year (12 minutes) paying with pennies.  Harvard University economist Greg Mankiw says that this wasted time costs the U.S. economy around $1 billion annually. An estimate from Citizens to Retire the U.S. Penny says that the 107 billion cash transactions in the United States annually add up to 120 million hours of time between customers and employees—at a cost of $2 billion to the U.S. economy. [27] [28] [29]
Rounding transactions to the nearest nickel instead of using pennies wouldn’t harm consumers or stores. Robert M. Whaples, professor of economics at Wake Forest University, crunched the numbers and found that “the convenience stores and the customers basically broke even.” [30]
Canada eliminated the physical penny in 2013, while the cent value was maintained for non-cash transactions. Cash transactions were simply rounded to the nearest nickel. Canadian society adjusted well to the change. [46]
Charities, too, have well adjusted to our increasingly cashless daily lives. An executive with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society told the New York Times that “soliciting donations in the form of ‘roundups’ (and add-ons) to credit-card transactions has proved ‘much more lucrative’ than coin gathering ever did.” Concluded the New York Times : “few things symbolize our national dysfunction more than the inability to stop minting this worthless currency.” [46]
Finally, as Forbes summarized in 2025, “eliminating the penny would not only have a negligible impact on inflation, costs and profits but also save time for customers and clerks.” Plus, the millions of dollars the country would save from eliminating the penny could be reallocated to more pressing national needs. “If the funds are reallocated to those who need it most, eliminating the penny would serve us well—making this change a penny-wise decision on the road to a more equitable economy.” [52]

By Foot There are plenty of ways to enjoy the Pittsburgh redbuds. Using the Three Rivers Heritage Trail , park near the stadiums and walk alongside the Allegheny, cross into Point State Park and then into the South Side and view a large number of the redbuds in one short trip. This entire walk is only about 2 miles, mostly flat and will take about 40 minutes (or three hours if you stop to take photos like me). Don't worry, I made you a map .
By Bike If you're biking to see the redbuds, consider expanding your travels to include the 10th Street Bypass area redbuds and enjoy the Allegheny Riverfront, and including the entire stretch of the North Shore from the Science Center all the way to the 16th Street Bridge. At the end of that trek, you'll have seen almost every redbud in Pittsburgh! Oh, and I highly recommend taking the Fort Pitt Bridge from the South Side for an exhilarating entrance into Point State Park .
By Paddle For a truly unique view, consider putting in your kayak or booking a spring sail aboard the Gateway Clipper riverboat to see the redbuds from the three rivers.

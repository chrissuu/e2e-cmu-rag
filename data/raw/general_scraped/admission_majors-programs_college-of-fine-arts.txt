Where styles intersect to create work that inspires.
In the College of Fine Arts — one of the first comprehensive arts training institutions founded in the country — you’ll unite with curious, passionate, innovative artists, musicians, architects, dramatists and designers across disciplines. From design that solves societal challenges to concertos that push the boundaries of musical pedagogy, you’ll pursue work in our studios and on our stages that sparks conversation, shifts mindsets and reminds us what it means to be human.

The Dunfermline Circle recognizes our donors who contribute $100,000 to $999,999 to the university during their lifetimes or through their estates.
They receive priority communication from university leadership, are invited to special events throughout the year and may specify degrees of anonymity and participation in the society to ensure their privacy.
This society is named for the Scottish region where Andrew Carnegie was born, pronounced DUN-firm-lyn, a place that remained close to his heart throughout his life.

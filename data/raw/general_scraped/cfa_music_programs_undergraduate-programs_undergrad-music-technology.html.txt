Music & Technology
A Collaborative Approach to the Future of Music
Carnegie Mellon University's Music and Technology program was established in 2009 as a joint project between three of the schools: The School of Music, School of Computer Science, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Building on this interdisciplinary approach, Carnegie Mellon University's Music and Technology program gives students everything they need to become the future of the music industry.
Students at the undergraduate and graduate levels are able to hone their skills in an interdisciplinary environment, focusing on a chosen area of study, such as Recording Technology, Audio Engineering, Computer Music, Music Composition, Music Performance, and Music Theory. Our expert faculty promotes a collaborative approach to cutting-edge education that gives our students both the specialized knowledge and breadth of skills to foster development in the field of music.
This program consists of a set of courses that span music, electrical engineering, and computer science, as well as a capstone composition/design/performance project. The goal of the core coursework in music and technology is to provide a comprehensive undergraduate understanding of all three areas of study: music, computer science and electrical engineering. In other words, regardless of the entry point – an interest in computer science, electrical engineering, or music – the coursework prescribed will allow each student to gain the requisite knowledge and experience in all three areas. Students will work closely with advisors and will be guided in both course selection and capstone projects. This program is for students who want to pursue music technology as a career. These may be students who are accomplished musicians, have a keen interest in science and engineering, and want to explore the musical applications of technology. These may also be students with experience in recording or electronic music composition/production who desire to study these areas along with the technological underpinnings of audio engineering and computer science.
For more specific information regarding the curriculum for the undergraduate Music & Technology program please refer to the Undergraduate Course Catalog or the details section on this page.
If you are a current Carnegie Mellon undergraduate student, you may apply for internal transfer into this degree program.

Internal transfer admission decisions, which will be effective as of the following semester, will be made later in October or March after midterm grades are published.
Internal Transfer Admission Policies
You must not be on probation or suspension in your current college.
You must have at least a 3.0 cumulative QPA.
First-year students cannot apply for transfer until the spring semester.
Students must be in residence in the program for a minimum of four semesters.
Because students must be in residence in the program for a minimum of four semesters, transfer beyond the end of the sophomore year will require enrollment for additional semesters beyond the usual eight semesters expected for completion of an undergraduate degree.

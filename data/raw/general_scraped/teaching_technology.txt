In this section, we present a few examples of educational technologies for you to explore and consider their affordances and limitations in relation to your learning goals. Making decisions about educational technologies can be tricky. Faculty sometimes ask if a specific technology will enhance student learning. Whether low tech (a chalkboard) or high tech (a 3-D interactive visualization), a toolâ€™s learning benefits depend on when, where, how, and why you use it. We can help you find a tool or set of tools that aligns with your goals, and provide you support as you select and integrate technology effectively into your teaching.

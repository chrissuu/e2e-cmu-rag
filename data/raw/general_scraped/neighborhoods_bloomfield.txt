â€‹Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's "Little Italy" - its Italian roots reaching back more than five generations.
The Bloomfield Bridge connects the neighborhood to the universities and cultural attractions in Oakland. Its colorful mix of shops and restaurants are renowned. Bloomfield is a feast as rich to the eyes as the homemade tortellini and cannoli in its shop windows are to the stomach.

Join Trust Arts Education for a pre-show chat on Wednesday nights with members from the company (schedule permitting) hosted by local theatre professionals to learn insights into the show you canâ€™t find in your playbill.
What special lighting cues should you watch for? What is life on tour like? What musical allusions will deepen your enjoyment of the show? What questions do you have? Now is your chance to ask! (While enjoying pre-show snacks!)

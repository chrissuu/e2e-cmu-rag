Shaping Higher Education
The Office of the Vice Provost for Enrollment Management and Dean of Admission provides vision and leadership for all aspects of Carnegie Mellon’s enrollment process. From the point of recruitment, the office is committed to fostering an environment where students and families feel welcome, prepared and supported during their transition to life at CMU all the way through Commencement. The office supports student success and positive outcomes by fostering collaborative partnerships across the university, promoting data driven decision-making, and planning for long-term enrollment strategy.
Enrollment Management is comprised of five functional areas and a one-stop student service center, which provide student-focused and highly efficient services and programs to support and enhance CMU’s recruitment and retention goals. The Office of Admission, The HUB, University Registrar’s Office, Student Financial Services, Office of International Education, and Enrollment Systems work together to serve students, families and the campus community through strategic enrollment planning and delivering valuable and effective student support and administrative services.

Aliquippa , city , Beaver county, western Pennsylvania , U.S. It lies along the Ohio River just northwest of Pittsburgh . Settled about 1750 as a post for trade with Delaware , Iroquois , and Shawnee Indians, it was first known as Logstown and was later renamed for “Queen” Aliquippa, probably a Seneca . After the French and Indian War (1754–63), the Native American peoples lost their title to the land, and Logstown was deserted. White settlers came again in the 1770s, and sawmilling and gristmilling were early industries. During the winter of 1793–94, Gen. Anthony (“Mad Anthony”) Wayne trained his troops at a site across the river from the adjacent borough of Woodlawn before moving into western Ohio to defeat the British-supported Northwest Indian Confederation at the Battle of Fallen Timbers (August 20, 1794).
Aliquippa was incorporated as a borough in 1892. It grew rapidly after 1900 with the establishment of steel mills in the area, and much of the workforce was engaged in steel production until the contraction of the steel industry in the late 1970s and early ’80s. Although some structural steel is still being produced, most of the steelmaking operations have been torn down, leaving the city with restricted employment opportunities and an aging population. Aliquippa consolidated in 1928. Pop. (2000) 11,734; (2010) 9,438.

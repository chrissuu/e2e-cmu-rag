Starting a new business in the City of Pittsburgh typically requires some approvals from city including the Department of City Planning (DCP) and the Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections (PLI). Depending on where the business is operating or how much work is being done on a building, it may also require review by the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (“DOMI”).
The OneStopPGH Counter is staffed with PLI, DCP and DOMI representatives who can help you understand what types of permits and reviews will be required for your business or project. They can help you get started on OneStopPGH, the City’s online permitting portal.
Development Review starts when you file a Building and Development Application through OneStopPGH. Staff can assist when you make an appointment to stop by the OneStopPGH Counter at 412 Boulevard of the Allies.
Any new construction or new business use (even without construction) requires zoning review – this review checks to make sure the proposed business use is in line with Pittsburgh's zoning code. The zoning code regulates which uses are permitted in different areas of the city, and includes standards for landscaping, design, parking, and other elements. It also outlines the public process required for certain developments.
While exploring locations, be sure to check whether your proposed business would be permitted in the area you’re thinking of operating in. Please consult the Zoning Use Table for permitted uses and the Pittsburgh Zoning Map to determine the zoning district your property is in.
For zoning review, the following information is typically required:
If there are any exterior alterations to the building or site, or if a new building is being constructed, a site plan is required that notes the location of the work. Please see the Site plan requirements for what to include on the site plan.
If there are any exterior alterations to the building or site, or if a new building is being constructed, a site plan is required that notes the location of the work. Please see the Site plan requirements for what to include on the site plan.
Some projects require additional processes. For example, if a use is not typically permitted or will not meet some other standard of the code, a hearing may be required at the Zoning Board of Adjustment (“ZBA”). Some types of uses automatically require ZBA approval – these are called “special exceptions.”
Some projects also require a hearing at the Planning Commission or City Council. These are typically large projects or substantial new construction.
You are encouraged to reach out to the local Registered Community Organizations ("RCOs") where your small business would be located. Community outreach is required if your project needs review by a board or commission. You can find information on RCOs here or contact the Department of City Planning Neighborhood Planners to help make the connection.
If you are planning to start a business in your own home, it may be considered “home occupation” under zoning regulations. There are specific standards that must be met in order for the city to consider a business a home occupation. You can read this at Zoning Code Section 912.05.
A home occupation still needs a Building and Development Application. The following information would be required:
The Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections reviews new construction and business occupancies against international codes. The following types of work require a permit from PLI:
To construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish or change the occupancy of a building, structure, or facility.
To construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish or change the occupancy of a building, structure, or facility.
To erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert or replace any electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system.
To erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert or replace any electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system.
PLI reviews most projects under the same Building and Development Application (BDA) as the zoning review. The OneStopPGH portal will identify required documents based on the permit type, structure type, work type, and work scope you have applied for.  If you have questions as to whether your work will require stamped drawings for review, please see PLI’s Standard Permit Application Requirements Guideline, contact pliapptech@pittsburghpa.gov or stop by the counter.
Note: You may be required to provide stamped, official drawings from a licensed architect or engineer before obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy. Work with OneStopPH staff to see if this applies to you as early as possible, so you can plan ahead.
The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure regulates work within the public right-of-way; that includes the street, curb, sidewalk, and public trails. DOMI approval is often required when new or altered parking is proposed, when a curb is cut to create a driveway, and when a use is proposed which may generate substantial traffic, parking and circulation issues. DOMI also reviews encroachments, like signs and awnings, when they project over the sidewalk or street.
This page includes information on various DOMI permits. Some of the most common types of permits a small business may be expected to complete for DOMI are Curb Cut and Encroachment Permits, depending on the amount of work planned. Others may also be required.
This list is not meant to be comprehensive. Please ensure you are meeting all other relevant local, county, state, and federal regulations.

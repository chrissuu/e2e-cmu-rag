Docent-led tours of Clayton are about an hour in length, and exhibition tours take 45 minutes. We recommend that groups allow 2.5 to 3 hours when visiting so that participants may also have ample time to visit, at their leisure, The Frick Art Museum, Car and Carriage Museum, Greenhouse, and the Frick Museum Store located in the Grable Visitor Center. Some participants may also wish to stroll the grounds.

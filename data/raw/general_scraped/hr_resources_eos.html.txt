Equal Opportunity Services
Equal Opportunity Services is an engaged leader in the university's commitment to the fair and equal treatment of all employees. Our commitment extends in providing equal employment opportunities for all persons without discrimination.
EOS provides leadership, direction and guidance in carrying out the university's equal opportunity responsibilities:
Monitor and administer the university's Affirmative Action Plan for individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.
Maintain reports for the administration of Equal Employment Opportunity laws and regulations.
Refer formal and informal complaints and grievances to the appropriate university access points.
Partner with campus and community organizations on university accessibility and employee job accommodations.
As members of the Universal Access Committee, we ensure the university complies with the obligations imposed on our "places of public accommodation." The Universal Access Committee evaluates potential accommodations and ensures compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) through projects designed to make the campus more accessible to all.

Each program manages their own separate admissions process, including deadlines and requirements, and this information varies by department. You are encouraged to visit the department's website in which you are interested to find specific details.
A student’s qualifications are not assessed until a full application has been received and processed. To learn more about your eligibility and how to apply, visit the department’s website in which you are interested. Some departments provide a few guidelines regarding the level of competitiveness. If provided, this would be found on the department website.
You are welcome to apply to more than one program, but in most cases you will need to complete separate applications for each. It is recommended not to assume that you can submit the exact same materials for each and to look closely at each program’s application requirements. Moreover, many departments have a list of FAQs that will address common issues, so if you are having technical difficulties with the application, check the department website and if the problem is not addressed on the website, contact the department directly.
Check the department website for an admission notification timeline or contact a department administrator to find out when you can expect a response regarding admissions.
All admissions-related questions, including where to submit transcripts, exam requirements, and how to set up a visit, should be directed to the department in which you are interested by visiting the college/school website linked in the Guide to Graduate Degrees and Programs section .

The History Behind Unblurred
Unblurred is a program run by the Penn Arts Initiative, which was created in 1998 as a shared strategy between Bloomfield-Garfield Corporation and Friendship Development Associates. This strategy was developed to help local artists with the renovation of dilapidated, empty buildings. As a result, the 4800 to 5500 blocks of Penn Avenue have transformed into a hub of inspiration and creativity.

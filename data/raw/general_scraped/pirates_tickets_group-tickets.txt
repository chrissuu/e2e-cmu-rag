The PNC Park bag policy is designed to enhance the safety of all guests entering PNC Park as well as streamline the ballpark entry process to provide guests with a safe and enjoyable gameday experience.
Each guest is permitted to bring one bag into the ballpark (purses, fanny packs, backpacks, etc.) provided that the bag is soft-sided and 16” x 16” x 8” or smaller. Bags exceeding these dimensions will not be permitted inside the ballpark. All bags are subject to search.
EXCEPTIONS TO BAG POLICY:
MEDICAL REASONS: Bags carried for medical reasons may be brought into PNC Park after being properly searched by security. Examples of medical reasons may include, but are not limited to, bags containing medical equipment, monitors, pumps, prosthetics, prescription medication, special dietary supplements, hearing assistance devices, aids for autism spectrum disorders, and breast feeding pumps. Over the counter medications are generally not considered a “medical reason” unless accompanied by medical directives from a physician.
DIAPER BAGS: Bags carried with diapers and supplies for the care of young children (infant or toddler), or a child with disabilities, are permitted after being properly searched by security. Examples of diaper bag contents include, but are not limited to, diapers, infant or child clothing, infant blankets, children’s bottles, sipping cups, formula, breast milk pumps, wipes, and snacks for the child.
Security Supervisors should be contacted with any questions regarding these exceptions.

Foundation Relations is part of the University Advancement division and works with CMU faculty and staff to make connections with private foundations and other nonprofit funders by:
Advising on the development of strategies to engage philanthropic partners
Assisting in identifying funding opportunities and submitting proposals
Supporting all aspects of reporting and stewardship
In collaboration with the Office of the Vice President for Research, the Office of Sponsored Projects and various college-based colleagues, we serve as a liaison to local, national and international foundations.
Our staff members manage the relationship between CMU and an assigned portfolio of funders, and focus on particular areas within the university research and outreach communities.

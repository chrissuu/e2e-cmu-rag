2024 Founders Medal
The highest honor bestowed on CMU alumni, this award recognizes both a long standing record of service and support to CMU and exceptional professional achievements. This year’s honoree is:
T. Jerome Holleran (ENG 1957; TPR 1969)
As a high school senior, T. Jerome “Jerry” Holleran received financial assistance that made it possible for him to attend Carnegie Tech, but it came with an important caveat: Return the favor. For 40 years, he has done exactly that.
With a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering and a master’s degree in industrial administration, Jerry crafted a wide-ranging career including sales, engineering, and marketing management, management consulting and business planning. In 1975, Jerry and several other businessmen bought a division of Rockwell International and formed an independent company, Arrow International, a medical device manufacturer. In 1997, Jerry and three associates bought a division of Arrow International and formed Precision Medical Products (PMP) which grew into a premier contract medical manufacturer.
Jerry reconnected with Carnegie Mellon, helping with advancement and development efforts and becoming a member of the university’s Board of Trustees for three decades. In 2004, he and his wife, Carolyn, established the Holleran Scholarship Challenge to create more endowed scholarships at CMU. They donated $2 million to the challenge, which asked donors who had never before created an endowed scholarship to give a portion of the amount needed to establish a scholarship and their fund would provide the remainder. The effort was a huge success, creating more than 100 new endowed scholarships.
For his work and philanthropy, Jerry has been honored with numerous awards including the Alvernia University Franciscan Award, College of Independent Colleges Individual Award for Philanthropy, CMU Distinguished Alumni Service Award and United Way of Berks County Doran Award, its highest award for leadership.

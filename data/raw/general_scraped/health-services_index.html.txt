University Health Services
Welcome, students! UHS offers high-quality care for all students.
Students are seen by appointment only. Same-day appointments are available on a limited basis depending on availability. We always do our best to work with patients with acute illnesses and injuries. To increase the likelihood of being seen sooner please contact us as early as possible.
If no appointments are available, students will be assessed by a triage nurse and provided with an appropriate plan of care which may include: guidance on symptom management; referrals to urgent/emergency care; scheduling for the next available appointment.
Call us at 412-268-2157, option 2 to discuss your needs.

Constitutional Carry
Should Permitless “Constitutional Carry” of Guns Be Legal?
The phrase “constitutional carry” refers to the Second Amendment’s “right to bear arms,” and means a person does not have to obtain a permit from their state to carry a concealed weapon in that state. Constitutional carry laws “allow individuals to carry loaded, concealed handguns in public without first undergoing a background check, obtaining a license, or receiving any firearm training,” according to the Center for American Progress. Some pro-gun organizations differentiate constitutional carry from “permitless carry,” with the latter carrying some restrictions such as no DUI convictions in the past ten years. However, common use of the phrase “constitutional carry” is interchangeable with “permitless carry” and “unrestricted carry” and includes any concealed carry of a firearm without a permit.

Red Flag Gun Laws
Should the U.S. Government Enact “Red Flag” Gun Control Laws?
“Red flag” laws, officially extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs), “are modeled off domestic violence protection orders, create a civil process allowing law enforcement, family members (in most states), and medical professionals or other groups (in some states) to petition a court to temporarily prohibit someone at risk of harming themselves or others from purchasing and possessing firearms for the duration of the order,” according to the Department of Justice.

Gun Show Loophole
Should the U.S. Government Close the “Gun Show Loophole”?
The “gun show loophole” is a regulatory hole in the background checks law that has historically allowed gun sellers to operate at gun shows and online without licenses and without performing the federal background checks required of gun shop sales. The Biden administration closed the loophole in Apr. 2024, to the chagrin of many gun rights activists. For more on gun control laws, explore the ProCon debate .

Currently, gun stores are required by law to conduct a background check for every gun sale. But, for decades, many dealers who sell weapons someplace other than the traditional gun store — say, for example, a gun show or a flea market or even through social media — have gotten away without conducting background checks. This is the so-called ‘gun show loophole.’
Every year, thousands of unlicensed gun dealers sell tens of thousands of guns without a single background check, including to buyers who, if they had been required to pass a background check, would have failed — for example, domestic abusers, violent felons, and even children.
This single gap in our federal background check system has caused unimaginable pain and suffering.
Next week, our nation will mark 25 years since the tragedy at Columbine, a horrific act of violence that was carried out in part with guns purchased through the gun show loophole.
Since then, from New Paris, Ohio; to Chicago, Illinois; to Midland-Odessa, Texas, so many communities have been torn apart by acts of violence committed with weapons bought without background checks.
So, in the memory of all those we have lost, today, as the head of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, I am proud to announce that all gun dealers now must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell their merchandise.”

I prefer, oh, I have an appetite for background checks. We’re going to be doing background checks. We’re working with Democrats. We’re working with Republicans. We already have very strong background checks but we’re going to be filling in some of the loopholes, as we call them, at the border. And speaking about at the border it would be really nice if the Democrats would indeed fix the loopholes because it would be really nice. But despite that, I want to thank Mexico. They have 26,000 soldiers at our border. They’re really stopping people from coming in.
So what happens is with background checks, we’re dealing with Democrats, we’re dealing with Republicans, we’re dealing with the NRA, we’re dealing with gun owners, we’re dealing with everybody. And I think we’re going to have something hopefully that’s meaningful. No, I didn’t say anything about that we had a great talk with Wayne [LaPierre, then CEO of the NRA] yesterday [and I] didn’t say anything about that. We just talked about concepts. Wayne agrees things have to be done also and we have areas where we can close….
We have a lot of we have a lot of background checks right now. Gun owners can tell you that, others can tell you that. But there are certain weaknesses. We want to fix the weaknesses and I think that will happen. Let’s see what happens. I’m concerned that no matter what we agreed to, when we get there I’m concerned the Democrats will say ‘oh well we now want this that we want’ and you know too slippery slope and that’s what actually your gun owners and a lot of other people are concerned with but assuming that that’s not going to take place by the Democrats, assuming they really want to get this done we can get it done.

Ghost Guns
Should the U.S Ban Ghost Guns?
“Simply put, ghost guns are guns that can be built at home absent a manufacturer’s license. Ghost guns, sometimes referred to as ‘do-it-yourself guns,’ are assembled by unlicensed individuals, rather than licensed manufacturers. Ghost guns generally evade all the regulations which apply to the regulated firearms industry. They don’t have the serial numbers and other critical markings required of licensed manufacturers that allow police to trace guns recovered in crimes and return stolen guns to their rightful owners,” according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Editors’ Note: In June 2018, the Trump administration settled with Defense Distributed to allow the company to sell 3D printed gun blueprints online. However, on July 31, 2018, deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley stated: “The President is committed to the safety and security of all Americans; he considers this his highest responsibility. In the United States, it’s currently illegal to own or make a wholly plastic gun of any kind, including those made on a 3D printer.” [5] [6]
Bump Stocks
Should “Bump Stocks” Be Banned?
“A bump stock is an attachment that replaces a semi-automatic rifle’s standard stock, the rear portion of the gun that rests on the shooter’s shoulder. It allows the rest of the gun to move back and forth while the stock stays in place, and includes a finger rest that keeps the trigger finger still. When the gun is fired and the shooter applies forward pressure on the barrel, the rifle recoils back into the stock and bounces forward again, “bumping” the trigger into the finger and firing another round. The device allows the shooter to fire far more rapidly than is possible with a standard stock,” according to journalist Melissa Quinn. Bump stocks were banned in the United States by the Trump administration in 2019. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Trump-era ban on June 14, 2024.

I just want to say, what bump stocks do, they allow the firing of hundreds of bullets a minute. It was bump stocks that resulted in 60 people being dead in Las Vegas, Nevada…. So, let’s take this seriously. Let’s understand that we all have the ability to weigh in on this important issue, especially when one in five Americans has a family member who was killed by gun violence when we know that gun violence is the number one cause of death of the children of America. Not cancer, not car accidents, gun violence. So, voters have a choice. And frankly, when we think about the decisions voters are going to make in November, there’s a clear contrast between where we stand and the former president [Trump]. Let’s not forget, the former president literally said, folks need to get over it as it relates to the gun violence issue in America.

Editors’ Note: The Biden Administration appealed a ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that invalidated the Trump Administration’s ban on bump stocks. In a filing with the Supreme Court, which is hearing the appeal, the Biden Justice Department states, “Bump stocks allow a shooter to fire hundreds of bullets a minute by a single pull of the trigger. Like other machineguns, rifles modified with bump stocks are exceedingly dangerous; Congress prohibited the possession of such weapons for good reason.” [7]

Body Cameras
Should Police Officers Wear Body Cameras?
Police body cameras (also called body-worn cameras) are small cameras worn on a law enforcement officer’s chest or head to record interactions between the officer and the public. The cameras have a microphone to capture sound and internal data storage to save video footage for later review. According to the Bureau of Justice Assistance, “[t]he video and audio recordings from BWCs [body-worn cameras] can be used by law enforcement to demonstrate transparency to their communities; to document statements, observations, behaviors, and other evidence; and to deter unprofessional, illegal, and inappropriate behaviors by both law enforcement and the public.” For more on police body cameras, explore the ProCon debate .

I certainly stand by my opposition to Gun Control when it comes to taking guns from law-abiding citizens. You mention that the media describes the AR-15 as an ‘assault rifle,’ which is one example of the many distortions they use to sell their agenda. However, the AR-15 does not fall under this category. Gun-banners are unfortunately preoccupied with the AR-15, magazine capacity, grips, and other aesthetics, precisely because of its popularity.
To the Left every gun is an assault weapon.
Gun control does not reduce crime. It has consistently failed to stop violence. Americans are entitled to protect their families, their property and themselves.

Defund the Police
Should Police Departments Be Defunded, if Not Abolished?
While there are multiple interpretations of “defund the police,” the basic definition is to move funding away from police departments and into community resources such as mental health experts, housing, and social workers. In the larger scope of the civil rights movement, some advocates would reallocate some police funding while keeping police departments, others would combine defunding with other police reforms such as body cameras and bias training, and others see defunding as a small step toward ultimately abolishing police departments and the prison system entirely. While ProCon has noted where candidates believe federal law enforcement should be defunded, this question concerns local and state police departments.

Q: Your position on background checks.
Trump: So Congress is looking at it very strongly bipartisan. I put in certain parameters, which you somewhat know about. I’m also very very concerned with the Second Amendment. Moreso than most presidents would be. People don’t realize we have very strong background checks right now. You go in to buy a gun, you have to sign up. There are a lot of background checks that have been approved over the years. So I’ll have to see what it is. But Congress is meeting bipartisan. Lot of people want to see something happen. But just remember this big mental problem and we do have a lot of background checks right now.
Q: So you’re not willing to support universal background checks right now?
Trump: I’m not saying anything. I’m saying Congress is going to be reporting back to me with ideas. And they’ll come in from Democrats and Republicans and I’ll look at it very strongly. But just remember, we already have a lot of background checks.

I’ve long been opposed to the death penalty. It is deeply immoral, irreversible, and ineffective. And if we are going to transform our country’s broken criminal justice system, we must be fearless — unafraid to speak hard truths.
Last week, my home state of California issued a moratorium on the death penalty — a system that has proven time and again to be an abject failure. It has wasted taxpayer money, has not kept our communities safe, and has discriminated against those with mental illness and people of color.
This is an important step forward. But I believe we must take it one step further and abolish the federal death penalty. This failed system is immoral, and as President I would lead the fight to end it. It’s simply the right thing to do.

Chase Oliver
Replace the death penalty with humane alternatives.
I am an opponent of the death penalty. In too many instances the government has carried out an execution and it was later found out that the convicted were innocent of their crimes. There is no reversal of death, nor any compensation that can make those murdered by the state, however unintentional, whole. It also does not deter crime, and the act itself is both cruel and does nothing to restore what was lost by the victims. In addition, of 198 nation-states and territories in the world, 140 have abolished this barbaric practice, leaving America among the minority of 58 who still abide by this tragic policy. As President, I would:
Immediately abolish the death penalty for all Federal crimes. Not only are mistakes sometimes made that are not discovered until the execution has been carried out, but prosecutors often use the threat of the penalty as a method for extracting confessions in exchange for more lenient sentencing. This presents ethical concerns in itself, not the least of which is innocent suspects confessing to crimes they did not commit to escape the needle, the chamber, or the chair.
Have Federal prosecutorial officials look for alternatives to life without parole, which is the most used substitute for the death penalty. While the gravity of some crimes, such as murder, is horrific, the goal of our prison system is to be rehabilitative as well as punitive. While not offenders will prove fit to enter society, some will earn a chance at clemency, and this should be allowed to happen on a case-by-case basis.
As usual, utilize the example of Federal policy as a bully pulpit to encourage governors and state legislators to revisit their own policies and practices.

Filibuster
Should the U.S. Senate Keep the Filibuster?
A filibuster is a parliamentary means for blocking a legislative body’s vote on an issue. As Encyclopaedia Britannica explains, a filibuster is “used in the United States Senate by a minority of the senators—sometimes even a single senator—to delay or prevent parliamentary action by talking so long that the majority either grants concessions or withdraws the bill.” The strategy is only used in the Senate because “unlike the House of Representatives, in which rules limit speaking time, the Senate allows unlimited debate on a bill. Speeches can be completely irrelevant to the issue.” For more on the filibuster, explore the ProCon debate .

Puerto Rico Statehood
Should Puerto Rico Be Granted U.S. Statehood?
Puerto Rico’s official name is the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico in Spanish, and is home to about 3.1 million people. The island is described as a “freely associated state” by its Spanish name. However, Puerto Rico is officially an unincorporated territory or commonwealth of the United States per the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Bill signed by President Truman in 1950. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens by birth. They cannot, however, vote in U.S. presidential elections, and may only elect a resident commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives (who may vote in committees only).

Editors’ Note: Trump previously stated he would allow Puerto Ricans to chose whether the island should be a state: “There are 3.7 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico. As citizens, they should be entitled to determine for themselves their political status. I am firmly committed to the process where Puerto Ricans might resolve their status according to Constitutional and Congressional protocols. I believe the people of Puerto Rico deserve a process of status self-determination that gives them a fair and unambiguous choice on this matter. As president I will do my part to insure that Congress follows the Constitution. The will of the Puerto Rican people in any status referendum should be considered as Congress follows through on any desired change in status for Puerto Rico, including statehood.” [15]
Recreational Marijuana
Should Recreational Marijuana Be Legal?
Recreational marijuana, also known as adult-use marijuana, was first legalized in Colorado and Washington in 2012. Marijuana legalization refers to the practice of allowing and regulating the production, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis so that marijuana use within the established rules is no longer a crime. There are different models of legalization, including allowing people to grow their own marijuana, nonprofit co-ops, and for-profit commercialization with retail sales. Recreational marijuana is legal in 23 states and Washington, D.C., but remains illegal at the federal level and in 27 states. For more on recreational marijuana, explore the ProCon debate .

As the failed War on Drugs drags into its fifth long decade, we can all see that the policies of strict prohibition and prison need to change.

In Florida, like so many other States that have already given their approval, personal amounts of marijuana will be legalized for adults with Amendment 3. Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the Voters, so it should be done correctly. We need the State Legislature to responsibly create laws that prohibit the use of it in public spaces, so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat run Cities. At the same time, someone should not be a criminal in Florida, when this is legal in so many other States. We do not need to ruin lives & waste Taxpayer Dollars arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them, and no one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl laced marijuana.
I mean, you see the same studies. It’s [marijuana] not helping people. I mean, studies are saying that it does damage. It does significant damage—and yet, from a voting standpoint, it’s a pretty popular thing. Canada has gone all that way [with legalization], and other countries have gone all that way.

Public Sector Unions
Should Public Sector Employees Have the Right to Unionize?
The National Labor Relations Act, signed in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, gave many private sector employees the right to form labor unions and engage in collective bargaining. Since the act excluded public sector (government) employees, about 21 million government employees currently have no federal right to unionize. FDR allegedly believed that private sector employees were more in need of union protection because they were more likely to be exploited by for-profit companies. Currently, the ability of public sector workers to unionize is governed by the states. which means some government employees have the right to unionize while others do not. [16]

The national security interests of the United States require expedient and efficient decision making. When new missions emerge or existing ones evolve, the Department of Defense requires maximum flexibility to respond to threats to carry out its mission of protecting the American people. This flexibility requires that military and civilian leadership manage their organizations to cultivate a lethal, agile force adaptive to new technologies and posture changes. Where collective bargaining is incompatible with these organizations’ missions, the Department of Defense should not be forced to sacrifice its national security mission and, instead, seek relief through third parties and administrative fora .

Washington, D.C., Statehood
Should Washington, DC, Be Granted U.S. Statehood?
The debate over whether to grant Washington, D.C., representation in Congress has been raging since 1801 when the district lost voting representation and became the seat of the US federal government. However, the statehood debate did not pick up steam until 1979 when J. Edward Guinan, a former priest, authored the first statehood initiative. Passed by a majority of D.C. residents in 1980, the initiative called for a constitutional convention to create a constitution for a “State of New Columbia” that would then be sent to Congress and President Ronald Reagan for approval in 1982 to grant DC statehood. The New Columbia Statehood commission later found no evidence that the request was ever considered by the federal government. For more on D.C. statehood, explore the ProCon debate .

This strong economy has prompted businesses to remain competitive by raising wages. Compensation is rising at near its fastest pace in a decade. Median household income has reached an all-time high. Wages are also rising faster for production and non-supervisory workers than for workers overall.
A $15.00 an hour minimum wage would reverse this economic progress and hurt workers.

Reparations for Slavery
Should the Federal Government Pay Reparations to the Descendants of Enslaved People?
Reparations are payments (monetary and otherwise) given to a group that has suffered harm. For example, Japanese-Americans who were interned in the United States during World War II have received reparations. Many believe the descendants of enslaved people should receive some form of reparations. For more on reparations, explore the ProCon debate .

You can look at the issue of untreated and undiagnosed trauma. African-Americans have higher rates of heart disease and high blood pressure. It is environmental. It is centuries of slavery, which was a form of violence where women were raped, where children were taken from their parents – violence associated with slavery. And that never – there was never any real intervention to break up what had been generations of people experiencing the highest forms of trauma. And trauma, undiagnosed and untreated, leads to physiological outcomes.
But listen; when – unless there’s intervention done, it will appear to be, perhaps, generational. But it’s generational only because the environment has not experienced a significant enough change to reverse the symptoms. You need to put resources and direct resources – extra resources – into those communities that have experienced that trauma. I think reparations – yeah.
I think that the word, the term reparations, it means different things to different people. But what I mean by it is that we need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what can be done, in terms of intervention, to correct course.
—NPR Morning Edition, “Sen. Kamala Harris On Reparations,” npr.org, Mar. 14, 2019
Jill Stein
A Jill Stein Administration will guarantee as a human right reparations to the descendants of African slaves for the historic crime of enslavement. Reparations is a cornerstone of the Black Agenda, but reparations is far from the only policy needed to begin to redress what has been stolen from the Black community over 400+ years.
Scholars and activists who have studied and formulated propositions for Reparations itself have put the minimum cash value of reparations at $12 trillion, to be paid to those who claim legitimate descendancy from enslaved Blacks prior to the Civil War. This number is derived not only from the stolen labor prior to 1865, but also from the reneged promise of Field Order 15, commonly referred to as ’40 acres and a mule,’ which was never made good upon.
We don’t need any further debate on whether reparations should be paid. They should, without question, as they were in 1988 to those impacted by WWII Japanese internment camps. The Stein administration will confer with Black community leaders on who qualifies, how they qualify (historical records exist), how much they will be paid in cash, and how those payments will be made.

In 2020, the ALA recorded 156 reported book challenges in the United States, a significant decrease from the 377 reported challenges in 2019 perhaps due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, challenges jumped to an all-time high in 2022 when attempts to ban books doubled from 2021 with 1,269 attempts to ban 2,571 unique titles. Sexually explicit content, offensive language, and “unsuited to any age group” are the top three reasons cited for requesting a book be removed. For more on book banning, explore the ProCon debate .

Student Loan Debt
Should Any Amount of Student Loan Debt Be Eliminated via Forgiveness or Bankruptcy?
Student loan debt is frequently in the news as politicians debate solutions to the rising costs of college that lead to sometimes crippling amounts of debt. For those with outstanding student loans, such debt can be discharged in two ways: forgiveness and bankruptcy.
On Aug. 24, 2022, President Biden announced a short loan freeze through Dec. 31, 2022, as well as a cancellation of “up to $20,000 of federal student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and up to $10,000 for other qualifying borrowers.” The White House stated about 43 million borrowers would qualify the cancellation, with 20 million borrowers qualifying to have their debt completely canceled. On June 30, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the student loan program in a 6-3 vote under the premise that federal law does not permit the U.S. Department of Education to cancel such student loans.

Chase Oliver
At this critical moment in time in our economy, millions of people find themselves saddled with an average of $28,950 in student loan debt. This puts them behind the eight-ball before they have even gotten started. 92% of all student loan debt is held or backed by our federal government, with some $1.61 trillion out of $1.75 trillion outstanding. This is a burden that neither students nor the taxpayers responsible for these guarantees can continue to bear. The skyrocketing costs of college education can be directly placed at the feet of this massive boondoggle, which creates perverse incentives to raise the costs of tuition by artificially inflating demand beyond that which the market would normally provide.
I will immediately end the Federal backing of student loans by asking Congress to make all current loans interest-free, while simultaneously ending all future government-guaranteed loans.
I would then make the discharge of interest revenue neutral by requiring the Department of Defense to cut costs by closing overseas bases and installations and bringing our troops home, instead of engaging in expensive nation-building and peacekeeping missions abroad. It is only right that the DoD bear part of the cost, as mounting debt is as big a threat to our security as any foreign enemy.
Finally, I would allow students to stabilize their financial situations by allowing student loan debt to be dischargeable in bankruptcy just like any other loan. I want a well-educated populace that can compete with the minds of any other nation, but not at the cost of our nation’s financial and retirement security.

Elections
Electoral College
Should the U.S. Abolish the Electoral College?
The electoral college was established in 1788. The Founding Fathers created the electoral college as a compromise between electing the president via a vote in Congress only or via a popular vote only. The electoral college comprises 538 electors; each state is allowed one elector for each Representative and Senator (D.C. is allowed 3 electors as established by the Twenty-Third Amendment). On election day, voters choosing a presidential candidate are actually casting a vote for an elector. For a candidate to win the presidency, they must win at least 270 electoral college votes.

The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to just the large States – the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power – & we can’t let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.
The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
Well, I mean, I`m not going to change my mind [about the electoral college] just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There`s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play, the Electoral College, and there`s something very good about that. But this is a different system, but I respect it. I do respect the system.

Election Day in the United States has occurred on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November ever since President John Tyler signed an 1845 law establishing a specific voting day for the entire country. Election Day could be made a holiday if a bill were passed by the U.S Congress then signed into law by the president. Approximately two million people who work for the federal government would then be given a paid day off.

In the United States, as Encyclopaedia Britannica explains, a felony is typically “punishable by a term of imprisonment of one year or more.” Further, for a felony conviction, “the offender may lose some civil rights.

Voting Age
Should the Voting Age Be Lowered to 16?
The U.S. voting age has been 18 since 1971. Congress proposed the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that year: “The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age.” The ratification process, which required approval from 38 states, was completed in about three months, the shortest amount of time of any amendment in U.S. history. From the 1990s to the present, elected officials in several U.S. states have made unsuccessful attempts to lower the voting age to 16, and sometimes even younger. Student activism in the wake of the Feb. 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, brought new life to the debate about letting younger people vote in elections.

First, when we pass my plan, all Americans will immediately have the ability to buy into Medicare.

Second, we will set up an expanded Medicare system, with a 10-year phase-in period. During this transition, we will automatically enroll newborns and the uninsured into this new and improved Medicare system, give all doctors time to get into the system, and provide a commonsense path for employers, employees, the underinsured, and others on federally-designated programs, such as Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act exchanges, to transition. This will expand the number of insured Americans and create a new viable public system that guarantees universal coverage at a lower cost.

Many of those who are insured still can’t afford healthcare due to huge out-of-pocket costs. Researchers estimate this lack of adequate healthcare led to over 330,000 excess deaths from Covid-19.

OTC Birth Control Pills
Should Birth Control Pills Be Available Over the Counter (OTC)?
About 10.5 million American women of reproductive age (15-49 years) used the birth control pill between 2017 and 2019. The Pill was the second most commonly used method of contraception in the United States after female sterilization (aka tubal ligation or “getting your tubes tied”). The Pill is currently available by prescription only, with the exception of Opill (a progestin-only pill), and a debate has emerged about whether the birth control pill should be available over-the-counter (OTC), which means the Pill would be available along with other drugs such as Tylenol and Benadryl in drug store aisles.

Prescription Drug Costs
Should the Federal Government Intervene to Lower Prescription Drugs Costs?
A prescription drug is a medication that may only be obtained with a medical professional’s recommendation and authorization. With 79% of Americans saying prescription drug costs are “unreasonable,” and 70% reporting lowering prescription drug costs as their highest healthcare priority, the popular prescription drug debate is not whether drug costs should be reduced but how to reduce prescription drug costs. One consideration is whether the United States federal government should regulate prescription drug prices. For more on the prescription drug costs, explore the ProCon debate.

We are here today with the firm belief that in the United States of America, no senior should ever have to choose between whether they are able to fill a prescription or fill their refrigerator with food…. And too many of our seniors risked their health as they may have delayed to refill their prescription or they cut their pills in half to try and stretch out the length of time that they could take their medication.
So, since we took office, President Biden and I and our administration has taken historic — historic action to cut the cost of prescription medication for our seniors.
We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month…. We will cap the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year…. And we have made vaccines free of charge, which will save seniors hundreds of dollars every year…. And we finally allowed Medicare to negotiate the price of medications with Big Pharma companies to the benefit of 65 million Americans at least.
As President, I will not stand idly by as Americans pay thousands of dollars for prescription drugs while big pharmaceutical companies rake in massive profits. This plan [“People Over Profit”] puts people over profit by forcing these companies to reduce prices for consumers and holding them accountable when they gouge Americans.

Healthcare is too expensive because of government overregulation. We should… reform how we bring new drugs to market and end practices such as patent evergreening which keep the cost of too many drugs artificially high. With more choices and free market forces, we will see a drop in the cost of healthcare overall….
We must lower the regulatory burden on the pharmaceutical industry, which imposes huge costs on research and development that both protects favored firms by erecting costly barriers to entry that crowd out smaller firms and increase the costs of end-products to consumers.
As I already stated, I would end the practice of evergreen patents, which create artificial product monopolies that keep prices high. While I understand the need for firms to protect their profits, competition would result in better versions of already existing medications, greater innovation, and lower prices.

The President signed four sweeping executive orders on Friday, which together will significantly lower the cost of prescription drugs while increasing access to life-saving medications such as insulin:
The first order directs federally qualified health centers to pass along massive discounts on insulin and epinephrine from drug companies to low-income Americans.
The second order will allow the safe, legal importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries where the price for identical drugs is lower.
The third order will prohibit secret deals between drug manufacturers and pharmacy ‘benefit manager’ middlemen, ensuring patients directly benefit from available discounts at the pharmacy counter.
The fourth order ensures the United States pays the lowest price available among economically advanced countries for Medicare Part B drugs. The United States often pays 80 percent more for these drugs than other developed nations.
‘The four orders that I’m signing today will completely restructure the prescription drug market, in terms of pricing and everything else, to make these medications affordable and accessible for all Americans,’ President Trump said.”

Abortion
Should Abortion Be Legal?
An abortion is “the expulsion of a fetus from the uterus before it has reached the stage of viability (in human beings, usually about the 20th week of gestation),” according to the Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica. On June 24, 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in a 6-3 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization , eliminating the federal constitutional right to abortion. For more on abortion, explore the ProCon debate .

My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.
I happen to be for the exceptions, like Ronald Reagan, with the life of the mother, rape, incest. I have to be there.
One of the reasons they wanted Roe v. Wade terminated is to bring it back into the states where a lot of people feel strongly the greatest progress for pro-life is now being made. There of course remains a vital role for the federal government in protecting unborn life.

As most people know, and for those who would like to know, I am strongly Pro-Life, with the three exceptions - Rape, Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan. We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new Federal Judges (many more to come), two great new Supreme Court Justices, the Mexico City Policy, and a whole new & positive attitude about the Right to Life. The Radical Left, with late term abortion (and worse), is imploding on this issue. We must stick together and Win for Life in 2020. If we are foolish and do not stay UNITED as one, all of our hard fought gains for Life can, and will, rapidly disappear!
And I am pro-life. And if you look at the question, I was in business. They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice. And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion. I hate the concept of abortion. And then since then, I’ve very much evolved.And what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn’t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. And I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.

Immigration
Refugees
Should the Government Allow More Refugees to Resettle in the United States?
“Beginning in 1980, the U.S. government moved from an ad hoc approach to the permanent, standardized system for identifying, vetting, and resettling prospective refugees that is still in use today,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. “The number of refugees admitted into the United States annually has generally declined from more than 200,000 at the start of the program in 1980 to 60,014 in 2023. Levels of refugee admissions fluctuated dramatically throughout that time period, falling through the 1980s and spiking again in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, before hitting a record low in 2021.” For more on the wider immigration issue, explore the ProCon debate .

From Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized rebuilding and strengthening the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program after its dismantling under the previous administration.
The United States has long been a leader in refugee resettlement, providing a beacon of hope for persecuted people around the world, facilitating international efforts to address record displacement, and demonstrating the generosity and core values of the American people. Today, on World Refugee Day, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing an update on actions taken under the President’s Executive Order 14013 to restore the nation’s refugee resettlement program as a longstanding demonstration of the United States’ promise and welcome.
The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is rebuilt and stronger than ever. This fiscal year, the United States will resettle more than 100,000 refugees, the most in three decades. The unfortunate reality is there are many more refugees who are still overseas and in need of resettlement. As we look ahead, the Administration encourages Americans to consider directly supporting and welcoming refugees into their community through the Welcome Corps. You can team up with others in your community, apply to sponsor a refugee family today, and welcome them into your community this summer.
Refugee resettlement in the United States represents the opportunity to start anew and pursue a life of safety and dignity without fear of persecution. In turn, refugees and asylees enrich American communities culturally and economically, contributing almost $124 billion to our nation’s economy from 2005 to 2019.

While there is no official legal definition of “sanctuary city,” the term generally refers to towns, cities, or counties that decline to cooperate completely with federal detention requests related to undocumented immigrants, often with a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. Some argue that sanctuary cities such as San Francisco, New York, and Chicago should not receive federal funding because they are not enforcing federal immigration laws. Others say that sanctuary city policies protect both citizens and undocumented immigrants. For more on sanctuary cities, explore the ProCon debate .

DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) is an Obama administration policy implemented on June 15, 2012. DACA prevents the deportation of some undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children and allows those immigrants to get work permits. The undocumented immigrants who participate in the program are referred to as Dreamers, a reference to the DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) that was first introduced in the Senate on Aug. 1, 2001 by Orrin Hatch (R-UT) but did not pass.

Editors’ Note: On Sep. 5, 2017, the Trump administration ended DACA. The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled that the decision to end the program was “done in an arbitrary and capricious manner,” and that the program must be restored. Trump had previously expressed conflicting opinions on DACA. [24] [25]
The deal was done. DACA is going to be just fine. We’re putting it in. It’s going to be just fine. And I am going to be, over the next few weeks, signing an immigration bill that a lot of people don’t know about. You have breaking news, but I’m signing a big immigration bill … I’m going to do a big executive order. I have the power to do it as president and I’m going to make DACA a part of it. But, we put it in, and we’ll probably going to then be taking it out. We’re working out the legal complexities right now, but I’m going to be signing a very major immigration bill as an executive order, which Supreme Court now, because of the DACA decision, has given me the power to do that...[W]hat I’m going to do is that they’re going to part of a much bigger bill on immigration. It’s going to be a very big bill, a very good bill, and merit-based bill and it will include DACA, and I think people are going to be very happy... But one of the aspects of the bill is going to be DACA. We’re going to have a road to citizenship.
In June of 2012, President Obama bypassed Congress to give work permits, social security numbers, and federal benefits to approximately 800,000 illegal immigrants currently between the ages of 15 and 36. The typical recipients of this executive amnesty, known as DACA, are in their twenties. Legislation offering these same benefits had been introduced in Congress on numerous occasions and rejected each time...The temporary implementation of DACA by the Obama Administration, after Congress repeatedly rejected this amnesty-first approach, also helped spur a humanitarian crisis – the massive surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America including, in some cases, young people who would become members of violent gangs throughout our country, such as MS-13...Therefore, in the best interests of our country, and in keeping with the obligations of my office, the Department of Homeland Security will begin an orderly transition and wind-down of DACA...As I’ve said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion – but through the lawful Democratic process – while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve.

It’s — you have the mountains. You have the rivers. You have some very powerful water areas. You have some areas that are virtually impossible to get by. So we didn’t need walls everywhere, but where we needed them — because it’s been so successful that we’ve added nearly 300 miles. And that’s currently under construction.

Allow me to repeat that: There is no new administration policy with respect to the border wall. We have repeatedly asked Congress to rescind this money, but it has not done so, and we are compelled to follow the law.”
On the first day of his presidency, Biden issued a proclamation that stated,
Like every nation, the United States has a right and a duty to secure its borders and protect its people against threats. But building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution. It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security. My Administration is committed to ensuring that the United States has a comprehensive and humane immigration system that operates consistently with our Nation’s values. In furtherance of that commitment, I have determined that the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border in Proclamation 9844 of February 15, 2019 (Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States), was unwarranted.

I am also directing a careful review of all resources appropriated or redirected to construct a southern border wall.” [26] [27]

Path to Citizenship
Should the U.S. Government Provide a Path to Citizenship for Undocumented Immigrants?
“Path to citizenship” is a political phrase that usually refers to allowing undocumented immigrants to become American citizens via a special process. This process may include special requirements (such as fees, background checks, or additional waiting times) beyond those already in place for the naturalization of documented immigrants. Citizenship means the immigrants could receive government benefits (such as Social Security), would be eligible to vote, could bring family members into the U.S., and would not be deported for committing a crime.

But we will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws, defy our rules, violate our borders, break into our country illegally. We won’t allow it.

Should Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) Be Grown?
Selective breeding techniques have been used to alter the genetic makeup of plants for thousands of years. The earliest form of selective breeding were simple and have persisted: farmers save and plant only the seeds of plants that produced the most tasty or largest (or otherwise preferable) results. In 1866, Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, discovered and developed the basics of DNA by crossbreeding peas. More recently, genetic engineering has allowed DNA from one species to be inserted into a different species to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

Recent advances in biotechnology have the potential to revolutionize agriculture and thereby enhance rural prosperity and improve the quality of American lives. Biotechnology can help the Nation meet its food production needs, raise the productivity of the American farmer, improve crop and animal characteristics, increase the nutritional value of crop and animal products, and enhance food safety. In order to realize these potential benefits, however, the United States must employ a science-based regulatory system that evaluates products based on human health and safety and potential benefits and risks to the environment. Such a system must both foster public confidence in biotechnology and avoid undue regulatory burdens.

For example, under net neutrality rules, Verizon could not speed up access to websites it owns, such as Yahoo and AOL, and could not slow down traffic, or charge extra fees, to other major websites like Google or YouTube. The rules were first implemented under the Obama administration, overturned by the Trump administration, and have been reinstated by the Biden administration.

The basic principle of Net Neutrality is that access to all websites should be treated equally. What the [Trump Administration] FCC wants to do is empower internet service provides to distort the online marketplace and set up a pay-for-play system. This would be a terrible mistake. Add your name to mine if you agree that we need to protect and expand internet access so that everyone in America — regardless of how much money they make or where they live — has equal access to the internet.

The FCC’s removal of net neutrality rules was officially implemented on June 11, 2018. [31]

Animal Testing
Should the U.S. Government Require the Use of Animals for Scientific or Commercial Testing?
Animals are used to develop medical treatments, determine the toxicity of medications, check the safety of products destined for human use, and other biomedical, commercial, and health care uses. Research on living animals has been practiced since at least 500 BC. There is a contemporary push by animal rights activists and others to eliminate or reduce the use of animals in testing.

Nuclear Energy
Should the U.S. Continue to Use Nuclear Energy?
Whether alternative energy can meet energy demands effectively enough to phase out finite fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) is hotly debated. Alternative energies include renewable sources–including solar, tidal, wind, biofuel, hydroelectric, and geothermal–and non-renewable nuclear power.

For decades, nuclear power has been the largest source of clean energy in the United States, accounting for 19% of total energy produced last year. The industry directly employs nearly 60,000 workers in good paying jobs, maintains these jobs for decades, and supports hundreds of thousands of other workers. In the midst of transformational changes taking place throughout the U.S. energy system, the Biden-Harris Administration is continuing to build on President Biden’s unprecedented goal of a carbon free electricity sector by 2035 while also ensuring that consumers across the country have access to affordable, reliable electric power, and creating good-paying clean energy jobs. Alongside renewable power sources like wind and solar, a new generation of nuclear reactors is now capturing the attention of a wide range of stakeholders for nuclear energy’s ability to produce clean, reliable energy and meet the needs of a fast-growing economy, driven by President Biden’s Investing in America agenda and manufacturing boom. The Administration recognizes that decarbonizing our power system, which accounts for a quarter of all the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, represents a pivotal challenge requiring all the expertise and ingenuity our nation can deliver.

Fracking (hydraulic fracturing) is a method of extracting natural gas from deep underground via a drilling technique. Most U.S. states allow fracking, though four states have banned the practice as of Feb. 2021: Vermont (2012), New York (temporarily in 2014; permanently in 2020), Maryland (2017), and Washington (2019).

TikTok
Should TikTok Be Banned?
TikTok is a “social media platform designed for creating, editing, and sharing short videos between 15 seconds and three minutes in length. TikTok provides songs and sounds as well as filters and special effects that users can add to their videos.” The app, launched in 2018, is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. here are concerns that the company could share sensitive user data with the Chinese Communist Party (the CCP), track the videos watched by Americans, and even manipulate the information seen by Americans to sway public opinion about China and influence American elections, serving, in a sense, as a propaganda and spying arm of the CCP. Some observers see this mission as part of China’s “Digital Silk Road” initiative, launched in 2015. These concerns have led to debates about whether to ban the app on government devices and, further, for everyday citizens. Each candidate tracked by ProCon has an active TikTok account.

The attempt to ban TikTok is nothing more than the latest assault on free speech by government and big tech through censoring and controlling the internet and social media.
TikTok is the leading platform for young people to communicate about their reality of being unable to afford rent, groceries, education and other essentials, while the worsening climate crisis looms over our future and both parties in Washington squander our money on endless war and genocide. Trying to ban TikTok is a transparent attempt to shut down this channel for us to communicate instead of solving the real problems we face.

I’m for TikTok because you need competition. If you don’t have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram.
Just so everyone knows, especially the young people, Crooked Joe Biden is responsible for banning TikTok. He is the one pushing it to close, and doing it to help his friends over at Facebook become richer and more dominant, and able to continue to fight, perhaps illegally, the Republican Party. It’s called ELECTION INTERFERENCE! Young people, and lots of others, must remember this on November 5th, ELECTION DAY, when they vote! They also must remember, more importantly, that he is destroying our Country, and is A MAJOR THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!
Andrew Ross Sorkin: You have called TikTok a national security threat. At one point you said that they are quote, ‘data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans personal and proprietary information’ And yet it appears that you’ve now reversed your view on banning TikTok. Why is that?
Trump: So I had it done. And then Congress said well they never they ultimately usually fail. They are a good like, extremely political and they’re extremely subject to people called lobbyists who happen to be very talented, very good and very rich. I could have banned TikTok I had his banned just about I could have gotten it done. But I said you know what, but I’ll leave it up to you. I didn’t push him too hard because you know, let them do their own research and development. And they decided not to do it. But as you know, I was at a point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to. I sort of said, You guys decide you make that decision because it’s a tough decision to make. Frankly, there are a lot of people on Tik Tok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it. There are a lot of users. There’s a lot of good and there’s a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don’t like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people along with a lot of the media. what Facebook did was lockboxes with a $500 million Zucker bucks lockboxes that he put in, I mean I consider illegal but you know they, you know they put people in jail when they spend. They put people in jail when they spend more than $5,600 in a campaign. They  to jail if they’re $200 Look at Dinesh D’Souza they put him in jail over a couple of 100 bucks. And yet here’s the guy spends $500 million and he doesn’t go to jail….
I do believe that I do believe it [that TikTok is a national security threat] and we have to very much go into privacy and make sure that we are protecting the American people’s privacy and data rights. And I agree but you know, we also have that problem with other you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies too. I mean, they get the information, they get plenty of information and they deal with China, and they’ll do whatever China wants. You know, if you look at some of our American companies, when you talk about high highly sophisticated companies that you think are American they are not so American they deal in China and China if China wants anything from them, they will give it so that’s a national security risk also, but when I look at it, I’m not looking to make Facebook, double the size. And if you if you ban TikTok Facebook and others, but mostly Facebook will be a big beneficiary. And I think Facebook has been very dishonest. I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.
As far as TikTok is concerned we’re banning them from the United States.

Space Colonization
Should Humans Colonize Space?
While humans have long thought of gods living in the sky, the idea of space travel or humans living in space dates to at least 1610 after the invention of the telescope when German astronomer Johannes Kepler wrote to Italian astronomer Galileo: “Let us create vessels and sails adjusted to the heavenly ether, and there will be plenty of people unafraid of the empty wastes. In the meantime, we shall prepare, for the brave sky-travellers, maps of the celestial bodies.” The most common ideas for space colonization now include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations.

The United States is experiencing an unprecedented youth mental health crisis. More than half of parents express concern over their children’s mental well-being, and there is now undeniable evidence that social media and other online platforms have contributed to our youth mental health crisis. The number of children and adolescents with anxiety and depression has risen nearly 30% in recent years. Between 2011 and 2021, the number of teens and young adults with depression more than doubled. According to the CDC, in 2021, 42% of high school students reported experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, including 57% of girls and 69% of LGBQ+ students, and nearly 1 in 3 high school girls reported having seriously considered suicide. Children are subject to the platforms’ excessive data collection, which they use to deliver sensational and harmful content and troves of paid advertising. And online platforms often use manipulative design techniques embedded in their products to promote addictive and compulsive use by young people to generate more revenue. Social media use in schools is affecting students’ mental health and disrupting learning. Advances in artificial intelligence could make these harms far worse, especially if not developed and deployed responsibly. Far too often, online platforms do not protect minors who use their products and services, even when alerted to the abuses experienced online….
The Department of Health and Human Services, through the Assistant Secretary of Substance Use and Mental Health Administration and in close partnership with the Department of Commerce, will lead an interagency Task Force on Kids Online Health & Safety to advance the health, safety and privacy of minors online with particular attention to preventing and mitigating the adverse health effects of online platforms on minors. It will identify current and emerging risks of harm to minors associated with online platforms, as well as potential health benefits of using online platforms. It will recommend measures and methods for assessing, preventing, and mitigating such harms; develop a research agenda regarding online harms and health benefits to minors; and recommend best practices and technical standards for transparency reports and audits related to online harms to the privacy, health, and safety on children and teenagers.

AI has the potential to do profound good to develop powerful new medicines to treat and even cure the diseases that have for generations plagued humanity, to dramatically improve agricultural production to help address global food insecurity, and to save countless lives in the fight against the climate crisis.
But just as AI has the potential to do profound good, it also has the potential to cause profound harm. From AI-enabled cyberattacks at a scale beyond anything we have seen before to AI-formulated bio-weapons that could endanger the lives of millions, these threats are often referred to as the “existential threats of AI” because, of course, they could endanger the very existence of humanity.

Defenders of violent video games argue that the research has failed to show a causal link between video games and real-world violence.

Animal Cruelty
Should the U.S. Government Pass More Laws to Protect against Animal Cruelty?
Animal cruelty is the “willful or wanton infliction of pain, suffering, or death upon an animal or the intentional or malicious neglect of an animal. ” According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, “In varying degrees, cruelty to animals is illegal in most countries, and interest in endangered species gave further impetus to the anticruelty movement in the late 20th century. Reflecting such interest, many laws have been passed, though they are seldom enforced unless public pressure is brought to bear. Acts targeted by the movement have ranged from the mistreatment of domesticated animals to bullfighting and vivisection. Factory farming, which involves various evidently cruel practices, has remained largely exempt from legal scrutiny.” [38]

National Anthem Protests
Is Kneeling during the National Anthem an Appropriate Form of Protest?
The debate about kneeling or sitting in protest during the national anthem was ignited by Colin Kaepernick in 2016 and escalated to become a nationally divisive issue. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first refused to stand during “The Star-Spangled Banner” on Aug. 26, 2016, to protest racial injustice and police brutality in the United States. Since that time, many other professional football players, high school athletes, and professional athletes in other sports have refused to stand for the national anthem. These protests have generated controversy and sparked a public conversation about the protesters’ messages and how they’ve chosen to deliver them. The debate largely quieted after the summer of 2020, with a brief resurgence about athletes displaying political gestures on Olympic podiums of Tokyo in 2021 and Beijing in 2022.

Let’s speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied.

Colin Kaepernick’s protest is a brave act of principle. As long as there’s impunity for police killings, we should protest.

The NFL has all sort of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can’t kneel during our National Anthem!
Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!

Cancel Culture
Is Cancel Culture Good for Society?
First used in 2016, the phrase “cancel culture,” also known as callout culture, is the removal (“canceling”) of support for individuals (and their work), a group of people, an organization, or a company due to an opinion or action on their part deemed objectionable to the parties “calling” them out. Those being canceled are typically first called out on social media to magnify the public knowledge of the perceived offense, whereupon the campaign to cancel ensues. The canceling can take several forms, including the exerting of pressure on organizations to cancel the public appearances or speaking engagements of the canceled parties and, in the case of businesses deemed offensive, organizing boycotts of their products. For more on cancel culture, explore the ProCon debate .

The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society as we know it.
—Ari Shapiro, et al., “How Cancel Culture Became Politicized — Just Like Political Correctness,” npr.org, July 26, 2021
Editors’ Note: Trump stated the above during a speech at the 2020 Republican National Convention. Many note that, despite Trump’s dislike of cancel culture when used against himself and allies, he frequently employs the tactic himself. For example, an Aug. 19, 2020 tweet: “Don’t buy GOODYEAR TIRES – They announced a BAN ON MAGA HATS. Get better tires for far less! (This is what the Radical Left Democrats do. Two can play the same game, and we have to start playing it now!).”

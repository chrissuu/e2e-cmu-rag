Arcade Comedy Theater 943 Liberty Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15222
Bracket Night @ Arcade is a fun, interactive game show where the audience and panelists get to decide the BEST of the BEST STUFF. At every Bracket Night show, you'll see four hilarious and passionate panelists duke it out in a battle of opinions as pop culture, food, and other stuff move through a competitive bracket.
You're in on the act too, as the audience votes from their seats until a winner is determined!
This month, youâ€™ll get to hear four champions of reproductive rights argue what makes the BEST WITCH, and then you crown the WINNING WITCH!
Proceeds from this event benefit Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania (PPWP).
All ticket holders are welcome at a post-show dessert reception with the show's panel, including Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania's Co-Interim President & CEO, Darah Boucher. Ticket holders receive one drink ticket.

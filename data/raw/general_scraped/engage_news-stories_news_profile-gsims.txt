The production side of the Autism Theater Project came into focus as Gena attended CMU. Gena found a mentor in Raymond W. Smith University Professor of Drama Barbara Mackenzie-Wood , who also has a sibling with autism.
Gena says Mackenzie-Wood's passion for teaching acting is rooted in her desire to help students express themselves, something Gena profoundly understood. During her sophomore year, with the guidance of Mackenzie-Wood, Gena devised a play as part of the School of Drama's annual Playground Festival — a weeklong exploration of student-initiated and student-directed work.
The play, “In the Life of a Child,” was inspired by Gena’s sister.
It explores the life of a young girl with autism who finds a magical world where her schoolmates are able to hear the voice inside her head. After performing it at CMU in 2016, Gena took the play to Miami in 2018, where it was produced by the Autism Theater Project at Actors’ Playhouse at The Miracle Theater and Miami Children’s Theater.
Since graduating, Gena has continued to expand the work of the Autism Theater Project.
During the pandemic, Gena homeschooled her now-teenaged sister — an experience that she calls “life-changing.” She felt an even stronger call to develop tools and resources to help disabled teens successfully transition into adulthood.
The newest initiative of the Autism Theater Project is a web series called “The Voice Inside,” which tells real stories about teens overcoming challenges in their lives, from their own perspectives.
Gena is working with professional autistic playwrights to write “The Voice Inside” and is developing it through Zoom workshops and rehearsals with autistic actors. She hopes the series will reach teens, parents and teachers and inspire them to look beyond a person’s challenges to see their true potential.

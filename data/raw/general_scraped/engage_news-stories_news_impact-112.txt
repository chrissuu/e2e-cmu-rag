“It's a very hard course. It takes students who know nothing of programming and ends with a project that can get them a job in the field,” Andre Sutanto (ENG 2013, 2013) says. “In object-oriented programming, there are often times that an overall program is designed before its support pieces, assuming that all of the support pieces work properly. In my career, this type of thinking helps me manage big tasks in a team. It helps me to subdivide a large task to multiple smaller tasks that can be assigned to different people, allowing for parallel work to get done quickly. This allows me to be a more efficient engineer and team leader in my professional work.”
“David Kosbie’s enthusiasm in teaching the class, and his genuine love for students and computer science, often spark that connection. When you have people who are very passionate about a certain subject, it's not hard to see it through, and that enthusiasm can be contagious. ”
“When I was the head TA for 112, my friend used to call me ‘the most popular person in CMU’ because everywhere I’d go, I’d say hi to people because they recognized me. About 600 students take the class each semester, so what’s notable is just the sheer number [of students who take it], and the relationship that we build throughout the course.”

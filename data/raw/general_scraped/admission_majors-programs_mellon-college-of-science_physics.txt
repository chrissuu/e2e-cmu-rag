Physics
Join our relentless search for a deeper understanding of what the world is made of and how it works. In the Physics department, our theorists work with pencil and paper, with the largest computers in the world, and with machine learning colleagues on campus. If you’re a let’s-try-it-one-more-time experimenter or a never-satisfied questioner, you’ll fit right in. You’ll find excellence across our chosen research areas: subatomic physics, quantum electronics, cosmology, and biological physics. Mentoring you — the next generation of scholars — is our passion.

High School Course Requirements
Note that BXA applicants are only reviewed for the College of Fine Arts (CFA.) If you indicate interest in the BXA program, you will not be reviewed for a second college/program outside of your CFA choice. The intercollege BXA offerings are designed for students whoâ€™d like to combine or juxtapose their interests in the arts and another academic program. Students must meet the admission standards of their academic choice and complete the specific application requirements for their CFA focus (portfolio review, pre-screen, audition or interview).
Indicating interest does not mean your offer of admission will include acceptance to one of our BXA programs. Notification of BXA admission will follow your initial offer.

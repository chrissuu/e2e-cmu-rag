Robotics Roadmap
After graduating from Dartmouth, Merritt took a job as a mechanical engineer at QBotix, a robotics firm focused on actuating solar panels. He enjoyed it so much that he decided to pursue a master’s degree in robotics.
“I got drawn into robotics and worked there for almost three years,” he says. “I had amazing mentorship and that's what motivated me to go to grad school.”
Merritt was accepted to CMU’s robotics program, where the roots for Kodama began to grow.
He was matched with Research Professor George Kantor, who required his students to build a robot and operate it in the field. Merritt and his lab partner developed a robot to automate phenotyping of sorghum and spent two summers in South Carolina testing it.
“It was a good experience in the hybrid of academia,” he says. “We were doing real research, building up 3D models of plants using stereo vision. I was extracting and identifying sorghum stalks. We were applying machine learning to it.”
That experience had a powerful impact on his career.
“It was my true introduction to agricultural robotics, and I've been in that space for the past decade,” he says. “In that decade, I've seen a ramp-up in the number of startups and the amount of funding exits in the agricultural robotics space. And I've wanted to start a company for a while. It’s been a goal of mine.”
He enrolled at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he received an MBA and took the first steps toward starting Kodama.
“I was investigating sectors that intersect with climate change but don't get a lot of attention right now,” he says. “That's where I stumbled upon forest management and realized it’s a sector of agriculture few roboticists are paying attention to and it's a hundred-billion-dollar market in the world.”
He connected with two venture capital firms, and Kodama Systems began to grow.

Housing & Residential Education
The residential experience at Carnegie Mellon embraces all aspects of a student's life. It's about you.
Together, Housing Services and the Office of Residential Education create a lived experience that supports, engages, and inspires students throughout their university experience. It's the place they call home, the place where they will learn more about themselves, their community, and the world around them. Within a 24/7 community of support, staff and residents build meaningful relationships that inspire exploration, growth, and learning.

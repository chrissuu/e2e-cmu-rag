Carnegie Mellon has always been a first mover in the AI space and remains deeply engaged in shaping the future of AI technologies and their uses. As we continue to learn about these tools and lean into their opportunities, we also want to address their challenges. While AI may be a helpful tool in the college admission process, itâ€™s crucial to approach it cautiously.
Carnegie Mellon wants to know applicants as individuals, and submitting genuine, authentic application materials can make a significant difference. AI should never replace your unique voice, experiences and personal expression and, if used at all, should only serve as a supplementary tool to enhance your writing (i.e., grammar and spelling checks, suggested structural or vocabulary improvements).
Additionally, if the generated content closely resembles published work, there may be a risk of unintentional plagiarism. Carefully consider any and all risks when using generative AI for any part of your application.

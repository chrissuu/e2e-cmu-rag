High School Course Requirements
Students interested in our BXA Intercollege Degree Programs need to apply and be admitted to a school within the College of Fine Arts and the corresponding academic college (School of Computer Science, Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences or Mellon College of Science). Please reference the college requirements for these individual programs.
For our other interdisciplinary degree programs, interested students should reference the college requirements for that program's "home" college. Please contact the Office of Admission if you have questions about these academic requirements.

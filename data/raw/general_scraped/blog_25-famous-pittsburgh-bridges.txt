The New York Times wrote that Pittsburgh is “the only city in America with an entrance” and that is thanks to the Fort Pitt Bridge. Visitors traveling from the airport into downtown exit from the Fort Pitt Tunnel and onto the Fort Pitt Bridge, where they are greeted by a stunning view of the city.
The bridge crosses the Monongahela River near Point State Park and is historically significant as the world’s first computer designed bowstring arch bridge and the first double-decker bowstring arch bridge.
Speak Like a Pittsburgher: "That's It, Fort Pitt," is common slang to say when an event or game is over. The phrase originates from an advertising campaign from Fort Pitt Beer.

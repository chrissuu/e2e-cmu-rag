Civil War literature is vast and can be overwhelming. Many of the books written by professional historians are good, solid works with great insights, though some can be pedantic. This subject attracts many amateur historians, and their works can range from interesting to highly problematic. Readers would be well advised to learn the background and training of an author in order to evaluate a work. The following suggestions for further information are divided into five groups: overviews of the war, books on individual personalities and campaigns, works dealing with the social and cultural impact of the war, studies of war-related politics, and documentaries covering the conflict.
Overviews
Essential multivolume works include Allan Nevins , The War for the Union , 4 vol. (1959–71, reissued 2000); and Bruce Catton , The Centennial History of the Civil War , 3 vol. (1961–65). Two books by James M. McPherson , Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction , 4th ed. (2009, with James K. Hogue ), and Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (1988, reissued 2003), are the best single-volume accounts of the war; the former places the war into a broad historical context, while the latter focuses on the war years. Russell F. Weigley , A Great Civil War: A Military and Political History, 1861–1865 (2000, reissued 2004), is also good. Frank E. Vandiver , Their Tattered Flags: The Epic of the Confederacy (1970, reprinted 1987); Gary W. Gallagher , The Confederate War: How Popular Will, Nationalism and Military Strategy Could Not Stave Off Defeat (1997, reissued 1999); and Emory M. Thomas , The Confederate Nation, 1861–1865 (1979, reissued 1993), concentrate on the South. Charles P. Roland , An American Iliad: The Story of the Civil War , 2nd ed. (2004), is a fine survey of the conflict. William M. Fowler, Jr. , Under Two Flags: The American Navy in the Civil War (1990, reissued 2001); Craig L. Symonds , The Civil War at Sea (2009); and James M. McPherson , War on the Waters: The Union and Confederate Navies, 1861–1865 (2012), cover sea combat.
Personalities and campaigns
Sketches of all the generals can be found in Ezra J. Warner , Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders (1959, reissued 2006), and Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders (1964, reissued 2002). Individual biographies of major personalities are numerous, and some of the better include William C. Davis , Jefferson Davis: The Man and His Hour (1991, reissued 1996); Benjamin P. Thomas , Abraham Lincoln: A Biography (1952, reissued 2008); David Herbert Donald , Lincoln (1995); Douglas Southall Freeman , R.E. Lee: A Biography , 4 vol. (1934–36, reissued 2001), and Lee’s Lieutenants: A Study in Command , 3 vol. (1942–44, reissued 1997; an abridged single volume was issued under the same title in 2001); Craig L. Symonds , Joseph E. Johnston: Civil War Biography , new ed. (1994); John F. Marszalek , Sherman: A Soldier’s Passion for Order (1993, reissued 2007); James I. Robertson, Jr. , Stonewall Jackson: The Man, the Soldier, the Legend (1997); and Jean Edward Smith , Grant (2001).
Historians have chronicled all the war’s campaigns and battles. Prominent works include Bruce Catton , The Army of the Potomac , 3 vol. (1952–62, reissued 1990); William C. Davis , Battle at Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War , 2nd ed. (1995); Wiley Sword , Shiloh: Bloody April , rev. ed. (1983); Robert G. Tanner , Stonewall in the Valley: Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson’s Shenandoah Valley Campaign, Spring 1862 , updated and rev. ed. (1996, reissued 2002); Stephen W. Sears , Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam , 1st Mariner ed. (2003), Gettysburg (2003), and Chancellorsville (1996); George C. Rable , Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! (2002); Alvin M. Josephy, Jr. , The Civil War in the American West (1991, reissued 1993); Albert Castel , Decision in the West: The Atlanta Campaign of 1864 (1992); Joseph T. Glatthaar , The March to the Sea and Beyond: Sherman’s Troops in the Savannah and Carolinas Campaigns (1985, reissued 1995); and Elizabeth R. Varon , Appomattox: Victory, Defeat, and Freedom at the End of the Civil War (2013). Archer Jones , Civil War Command and Strategy: The Process of Victory and Defeat (1992), examines how and why the North prevailed in the fight; while Michael C.C. Adams , Our Masters the Rebels: A Speculation on Union Military Failure in the East, 1861–1865 (1978, reissued as Fighting for Defeat , 1992), makes a case for why the leadership of the North’s highest-profile army was so weak. Richard M. McMurry , Two Great Rebel Armies: An Essay in Confederate Military History (1989, reissued 1996), compares the main rebel armies of the East and West. Michael Shaara , The Killer Angels (1974, reissued 2011), is an outstanding fictionalized account of the Battle of Gettysburg; while Margaret S. Creighton , The Colors of Courage: Gettysburg’s Hidden History: Immigrants, Women, and African-Americans in the Civil War’s Defining Battle (2005), is a superb study of the town of Gettysburg and its residents before, during, and after the battle. Joseph T. Glatthaar , Forged in Battle: The Civil War Alliance of Black Soldiers and White Officers (1990, reissued 2000), is a highly readable study of this relationship.
Social and cultural impact
The lives of ordinary combatants and civilians during the Civil War became a subject of particular interest to historians in the late 20th and early 21st century. Bell Irvin Wiley , The Life of Johnny Reb: The Common Soldier of the Confederacy , updated ed. (2008), and The Life of Billy Yank: The Common Soldier of the Union , updated ed. (2008), are standard sources; James I. Robertson, Jr. , Soldiers Blue and Gray (1988, reissued 1998), updates Wiley’s look at the common soldier. Gerald F. Linderman , Embattled Courage: The Experience of Combat in the American Civil War (1987), is exceptionally good; as is James M. McPherson , For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War (1997, reissued 1999), which explains what motivated men on both sides to fight. Also very informative are Drew Gilpin Faust , This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War (2008), and Mothers of Invention: Women of the Slaveholding South in the American Civil War (1996, reissued 2004); Michael Fellman , Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri During the American Civil War (1989); Reid Mitchell , The Vacant Chair: The Northern Soldier Leaves Home (1993, reissued 1995); and Mark Grimsley , The Hard Hand of War: Union Military Policy Toward Southern Civilians, 1861–1865 (1995).
Politics
The best book on Southern politics remains George C. Rable , The Confederate Republic: A Revolution Against Politics (1994, reissued 2007). Far more research has been done on Northern political culture, including Phillip Shaw Paludan , A People’s Contest: The Union and Civil War, 1861–1865 , 2nd ed. (1996); Jennifer L. Weber , Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln’s Opponents in the North (2006, reissued 2008); and William B. Hesseltine , Lincoln and the War Governors (1948, reissued 1972). Lincoln and his leadership are the focus of Eric Foner , The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery (2010); James M. McPherson , Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution (1990, reissued 1992); and Doris Kearns Goodwin , Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005). Michael Vorenberg , Final Freedom: The Civil War, the Abolition of Slavery, and the Thirteenth Amendment (2001), also is informative.
Documentaries
The Civil War (1989), produced by Ken Burns for the Public Broadcasting System, covers most aspects of the Civil War and remains the indispensable video resource on it. Death and the Civil War (2012), directed by Ric Burns for the Public Broadcasting System’s series The American Experience , reminds contemporary audiences of one of the most basic facts of the war for the people who lived it. Civil War Combat (1999), directed by Jim Lindsey and David DeVries for the Arts and Entertainment Television Networks, examines the war’s major battles. Civil War Journal (1993), and Civil War Journal II (1994), produced by Greystone Communications, Inc. , and the Arts and Entertainment Television Networks for the History Channel, is a broader look at the people and events of the war. Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided (2001), directed by David Grubin , is the best look at the Union president; while Lee and Grant: Generals of the Civil War (2011), a compilation of the individual documentaries on Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant that were produced by The American Experience , is an excellent study of the two commanders. The Arts and Entertainment Television Networks produced fine single-volume treatments of many of the war’s other personalities. One of the war’s most-celebrated units receives fine treatment in The American Experience documentary The Massachusetts 54th Colored Infantry (1991).

Your Donor Benefits
When you give to the PSO, you’re not just supporting performances. You’re performing with the orchestra, connecting memories to Pittsburgh’s soul.
As a member of our donor family, you provide the foundation for the Pittsburgh Symphony to continue passionate performances at Heinz Hall for more than 250,000 patrons annually. Your gift allows the PSO to forge new partnerships and build bridges across communities. You inspire your fellow Pittsburghers through the power of music, and you make our region a better place to live.
Thank you for your support and we’ll see you at the Symphony!

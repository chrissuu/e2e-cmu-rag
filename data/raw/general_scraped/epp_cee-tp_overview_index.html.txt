Carnegie Mellon University's Center for Executive Education in Technology Policy (CEE-TP) provides courses that inform government officials and current and future leaders around the world about technology-related public policy issues. We serve leaders from more than 100 countries, with an initial focus on the policy issues of information and communications technology (ICT) through our ICT in Developing Countries program .
CEE-TP provides a broad and multifaceted curriculum that is highly interdisciplinary, mixing technology, policy, economics, and business issues. Our courses help governments and private sector actors in these countries make informed decisions, so they can establish policies and regulations that foster accessible and secure infrastructure, encourage investment and innovation, and generally meet the needs of their citizens. The world-class instructors who deliver our content have extensive experience in academia, government, and industry. Courses are available online and in-person, from Carnegie Mellon sites in Africa, Asia, and North America.

Organizations looking to make the most of their meetings and events can now utilize The Confluence, an Event Studio, which provides the opportunity to live stream, pre-record presentations and host hybrid events.
The Confluence, a completely customizable and mobile space, offers a professional setting and the latest technology to present webinars, panel discussions, training, summits and keynotes. This flexibility stems from a combination of onsite partnerships with Three Rivers Entertainment , which has years of experience executing high quality virtual, hybrid and recorded productions; and showNets, the DLCC’s exclusive telecommunications provider that offers a fully redundant dual circuit that can burst well above planners’ needs.
The space’s name – The Confluence - was chosen in part to recognize the location of the city at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, where they meet to form the Ohio River, as well as to recognize the importance of meetings, conventions and events.

Ticket Donations
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is proud to support community efforts and nonprofit organizations by donating ticket vouchers for a variety of fundraising and benefit events. We appreciate the opportunity to be part of your event by sharing the magic of the arts with you.
How It Works
If you are a nonprofit organization seeking support, you can submit a request for donations through our online platform.
All donation requests will be reviewed within the next few weeks. Events must be at least 30 days past request date for consideration. The organization requesting the donation will be contacted by email, regardless of whether or not the request is approved.
Please note, due to the high volume of requests that we receive, we may be unable to participate in all of the worthy opportunities presented to us.
No calls please.

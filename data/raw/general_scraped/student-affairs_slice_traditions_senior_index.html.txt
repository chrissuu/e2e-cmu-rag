In consideration of trends around the country related to the physical printing of yearbooks and the continued evolution of technology as a more sustainable form of communication and archive, CMU student leaders made the difficult decision to sunset The Thistle physical yearbook. CMU will continue to celebrate its graduating classes in a myriad of other ways by CMU departments, colleges, and university communications, as well as seek out new and innovative ways to commemorate CMU’s classes.
Graduating students leave long lasting impressions and impacts on campus, and CMU is grateful and better for their investment in the university community. Celebrating their work and cataloging it for historical purposes is an important responsibility. The Office of Student Involvement and Traditions and Office of Community Engagement and Leadership Development will continue to highlight and celebrate graduating students through long-standing and important traditions including:
Student Commencement Speaker
Senior Week
Senior Leadership Recognition
Additionally, moving forward, of Office of Student Involvement and Traditions will offer the opportunity for undergraduate seniors to have their professional portraits taken and be included in a photobook, which will be available for purchase through Lauren Studios.
Once campus life returns to a more typical year, The Tartan student newspaper hopes to return to printing a dedicated Commencement issue, featuring highlights of the graduating class throughout the four years leading up to that year’s ceremony.

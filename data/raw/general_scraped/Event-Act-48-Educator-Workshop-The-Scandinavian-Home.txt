About Laurina Bergqvist
Laurina Bergqvist, a professional storyteller with a master’s degree in Storytelling and a graduate certificate in Transformative Game Design, grew up with a foot in two cultures—enchanted by her father’s tales of Clatsop County, Oregon, and later discovering her own voice at a cultural center in Sweden. For over 30 years, she has followed a winding trail of tales, collecting stories, laughter, and lessons. A certified teacher in Sweden’s folk high school system, Laurina continues to share stories that spark imagination, build bridges across generations, and leave a little kindness in every audience.

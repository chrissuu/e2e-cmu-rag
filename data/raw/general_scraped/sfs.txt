Government Shutdown & Financial Aid
As of October 1, 2025, the federal government has entered a shutdown. While this does not impact your access to federal financial aid or your ability to complete the FAFSA, students and families should expect customer service delays - or in many cases, no federal customer service availability at all - during this period. The HUB remains available to support you with financial aid questions or concerns.

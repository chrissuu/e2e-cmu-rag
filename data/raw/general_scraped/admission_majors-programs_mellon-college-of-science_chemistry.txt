Chemistry
If you’re the kind that considers lab goggles an essential accessory, you’ll find your place in the Department of Chemistry. Here, you’ll build a solid foundation in the knowledge and theory of the discipline, and gain a firm grasp on the field’s practical, professional and ethical aspects. You’ll become a scientist who can think through theories, evaluate data, apply reasoning across disciplines and design experiments — and you’ll have the integrity to consider how your work will affect people and the planet, too.

Boat building is the design and construction of boats (instead of the larger ships) — and their on-board systems. This includes at minimum the construction of a hull, with any necessary propulsion, mechanical, navigation, safety and other service systems as the craft requires.[1]

The boat building industry provides for the design, manufacturing, repair and modification of human-powered watercrafts, sailboats, motorboats, airboats and submersibles, and caters for various demands from recreational (e.g. launches, dinghies and yachts), commercial (e.g. tour boats, ferry boats and lighters), residential (houseboats), to professional (e.g. fishing boats, tugboats, lifeboats and patrol boats).

Wood is the traditional boat building material used for hull and spar construction. It is buoyant, widely available and easily worked. It is a popular material for small boats (of e.g. 6-metre (20 ft) length; such as dinghies and sailboats). Its abrasion resistance varies according to the hardness and density of the wood and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisms are allowed to penetrate the wood. Woods such as teak, totara and some cedars have natural chemicals which prevent rot whereas other woods, such as Pinus radiata, will rot very quickly. The hull of a wooden boat usually consists of planking fastened to frames and a keel. Keel and frames are traditionally made of hardwoods such as oak while planking can be oak but is more often softwood such as pine, larch or cedar.[2]

Traditional wood construction techniques can be classified into the "shell-first" method (also called "planking first") and the "frame first" method. With "shell first", the form of the hull is determined by joining shaped planks that are fastened together, followed by reinforcing the structure with the frames (or ribs) that are fitted to the inside. With "frame first", the hull shape is established by setting up the frames on the keel and then fastening the planking on the outside.[3]: 8 

Some types of wood construction include:

Either used in sheet or alternatively, plate[15] for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. It is strong, but heavy (despite the fact that the thickness of the hull can be less). It is generally about 30% heavier than aluminium and somewhat more heavy than polyester. The material rusts unless protected from water (this is usually done by means of a covering of paint). Modern steel components are welded or bolted together. As the welding can be done very easily (with common welding equipment), and as the material is very cheap, it is a popular material with amateur builders. Also, amateur builders which are not yet well established in building steel ships may opt for DIY construction kits. If steel is used, a zinc layer is often applied to coat the entire hull. It is applied after sandblasting (which is required to have a cleaned surface) and before painting. The painting is usually done with lead paint (Pb3O4). Optionally, the covering with the zinc layer may be left out, but it is generally not recommended. Zinc anodes also need to be placed on the ship's hull. Until the mid-1900s, steel sheets were riveted together.

Aluminum and aluminum alloys are used both in sheet form for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. Many sailing spars are frequently made of aluminium after 1960. It is the lightest material for building large boats (being 15–20% lighter than polyester and 30% lighter than steel). Aluminium is relatively cheap in comparison with wood or steel in most countries. In addition it is relatively easy to cut, bend and weld. Galvanic corrosion below the waterline in salt water is a serious concern, particularly in marinas where there are other conflicting metals. Aluminium is most commonly found in yachts, pontoon and power boats that are not kept permanently in the water. Aluminium yachts are particularly popular in France.

A relatively expensive metal used only very occasionally[why?] in boatbuilding is cupronickel. Arguably the ideal metal for boat hulls, cupronickel is reasonably tough, highly resistant to corrosion in seawater, and is (because of its copper content) a very effective antifouling metal. Cupronickel may be found on the hulls of premium tugboats, fishing boats and other working boats; and may even be used for propellers and propeller shafts.

Fiberglass (glass-reinforced plastic or GRP) is typically used for production boats because of its ability to reuse a female mould as the foundation for the shape of the boat. The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin-saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness. GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof. These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich (cored) type, in which a core of balsa, foam or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mould, but before the inner skin is laid. This is similar to the next type, composite, but is not usually classified as composite, since the core material in this case does not provide much additional strength. It does, however, increase stiffness, which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight. Most fibreglass boats are currently made in an open mould, with fibreglass and resin applied by hand (hand-lay-up method).[16] Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibres are laid out and resin is pulled into the mould by atmospheric pressure. This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin, but takes special materials and more technical knowledge. Older fibreglass boats before 1990 were often not constructed in controlled temperature buildings leading to the widespread problem of fibreglass pox, where seawater seeped through small holes and caused delamination. The name comes from the multitude of surface pits in the outer gelcoat layer which resembles smallpox. Sometimes the problem was caused by atmospheric moisture being trapped in the layup during construction in humid weather.

The 21st century has seen the introduction of advanced composite materials in boat construction. Carbon fiber composites offer exceptional strength-to-weight ratios and are increasingly used in high-performance sailing yachts and racing boats. Kevlar reinforcement provides impact resistance and is commonly used in kayaks and canoes.[17]

Sustainable materials have gained prominence, with manufacturers incorporating flax fiber, hemp fiber, and bio-based resins to reduce environmental impact. Recycled materials, including PET foam cores from plastic bottles, are increasingly used in sandwich construction.[18]

"Composite construction" involves a variety of composite materials and methods: an early example was a timber carvel skin attached to a frame and deck beams made of iron. Sheet copper anti-fouling ("copper=bottomed") could be attached to a wooden hull provided the risk of galvanic corrosion was minimised. Fast cargo vessels once were copper-bottomed to prevent being slowed by marine fouling.  GRP and ferrocement hulls are classic composite hulls, the term "composite" applies also to plastics reinforced with fibers other than glass.  When a hull is being created in a female mould, the composite materials are applied to the mould in the form of a thermosetting plastic (usually epoxy, polyester, or vinylester) and some kind of fiber cloth (fiberglass, kevlar, dynel, carbon fiber, etc.). These methods can give strength-to-weight ratios approaching that of aluminum, while requiring less specialized tools and construction skills.

The 21st century has seen significant digitization in boat building through computer-aided design (CAD), CNC machining, and 3D printing. CNC machines are increasingly used for cutting aluminum panels, steel plates, and composite materials with precision previously unachievable by hand.[19]

3D printing technology has emerged for producing boat hulls, molds, and components. The first functional large-format 3D-printed monolithic catamaran was completed in 2025, demonstrating the potential for additive manufacturing to reduce production times and material waste.[20]

First developed in the mid-19th century in both France and Holland, ferrocement was also used for the D-Day Mulberry harbours. After a buzz of excitement among homebuilders in the 1960s, ferro building has since declined.

Ferrocement is a relatively cheap method to produce a hull, although unsuitable for commercial mass production. A steel and iron "armature" is built to the exact shape of the hull, ultimately being covered in galvanised chicken netting. Then, on a single day, the cement is applied by a team of plasterers. The cement:sand ratio is a very rich 4:1. As the hull thickness is typically 2.5 to 3 cms,  ferrocement is unsuitable for boats less than about 15 metres LOA as there is a weight penalty; above that length there is no penalty. Properly plastered ferrocement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines, and amateur builders are advised to use professional plasterers to produce a smooth finish. In the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, the cheapness of ferro construction encouraged amateur builders to build hulls larger than they could afford, not anticipating that the fitting-out costs of a larger boat can be crippling.

The advantages of a ferro hull are:

The disadvantages are:

There are many hull types, and a builder should choose the most appropriate one for the boat's intended purpose. For example, a sea-going vessel needs a hull which is more stable and robust than a hull used in rivers and canals. Hull types include:

Modern hull design increasingly utilizes **computational fluid dynamics** (CFD) for optimizing hydrodynamic performance. **Multi-chine hulls** allow approximation of round hull shapes using flat panels, popular in aluminum construction.

Modern boat building must comply with various ISO standards for safety and construction quality. Key standards include ISO 15085:2024 for man-overboard prevention systems, ISO 12217-1:2022 for stability assessment, and EN ISO 6185-3:2024 for inflatable boats.[21]

ISO 12215-5:2019 provides guidelines for hull structural design, while ISO 21487:2022 covers permanently installed fuel tank requirements.[22]

Regional regulations such as the Recreational Craft Directive 2013/53/EU govern design categories and safety requirements for recreational vessels in Europe.

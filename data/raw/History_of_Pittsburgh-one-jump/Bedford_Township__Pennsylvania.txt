The northern end of Wills Mountain is known as Kinton Knob and is the crest of a plunging anticline. The Silurian Tuscarora Formation, a hard sandstone, outcrops at the crests of these ridges and is stratigraphically lower and thus older than the rest of the bedrock in the township. The overlying formations are either Silurian or Devonian in age, and include (in ascending order) the Clinton Group, the Bloomsburg Formation, the Mifflintown Formation, the Wills Creek Formation, the Tonoloway Formation, the Keyser Formation, the Old Port Formation, the Onondaga Formation, and the Hamilton Group, which is composed of the Marcellus Shale and the Mahantango Formation. The Ridgeley Member of the Old Port Formation, another sandstone and conglomerate, forms the low ridge in the center of the township south of the town of Bedford, as well as Stiffler Ridge in Dunning Cove. Dunning Cove itself is a structural basin.[5]

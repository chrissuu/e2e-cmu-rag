Pittsburgh is the second-largest city in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, with a metropolitan area population of over 2.3 million as of 2025. The city is home to over 125 high-rise buildings with a height of at least 115 feet (35 m),[1] 34 of which exceed 300 ft (91 m). Pittsburgh's skyline is the second-largest in Pennsylvania, after Philadelphia. The tallest building in Pittsburgh is the 64-story U.S. Steel Tower, which rises 841 feet (256 m) and was completed in 1970. It was built as the headquarters of U.S Steel, reflecting Pittsburgh's role in the steel industry. The tower is the fifth tallest building in Pennsylvania. Pittsurgh and Philadelphia make up the vast majority of high-rises in Pennsylvania.

The majority of high-rises in Pittsburgh are located in the city's downtown, forming a compact, triangular-shaped skyline bound to the north by the Alleghany River, to the south by the Monongahela River, and to the east by Interstate 579. Pittsburgh's numerous bridges that traverse the two rivers are a common cityscape feature, and are often pictured alongside its skyscrapers. Mount Washington is a popular photography spot of the downtown skyline. Less than three miles east of downtown is Oakland, containing the city's second major concentration of high-rises, many of which are part of the University of Pittsburgh. By far the tallest building in Oakland is the 535 ft (161 m) tall Cathedral of Learning, a Gothic Revival skyscraper that is Pittsburgh's eighth-tallest building and one of the university's main buildings.

From the early 1930s to the 1970s, Pittsburgh had one of the tallest skylines in the world. The history of skyscrapers in Pittsburgh began with the 1895 completion of the Carnegie Building; this structure, rising 13 floors, was the first steel-framed skyscraper to be constructed in the city.[2][3] It never held the title of tallest structure in Pittsburgh, however, as it did not surpass the 249-foot (76 m) tower of the Allegheny County Courthouse.[4] Pittsburgh was the side of considerable pre-war skyscraper development in the United States, including early landmarks such as the Grant Building and the Gulf Tower. 14 high-rises over 300 ft (91 m) where built before 1940, making up about a third of all buildings above that height in the city. After a lull in construction from the mid-1930s to the late 1940s, skyscraper construction resumed in the 1950s. Pittsburgh experienced a large building boom from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. During this time, 11 of the city's 20 tallest buildings were constructed, including the city's three tallest structures: the U.S. Steel Tower, BNY Mellon Center, and PPG Place, which is notable for its glass spires.

Unlike many other major American cities, relatively few high-rises have been built in Pittsburgh during the 21st century, as the population of the city and Greater Pittsburgh continued to decline from its peak in the mid-20th century. Only three skyscrapers over 300 ft (91 m) have been completed since 2000: Three PNC Plaza in 2010, Tower at PNC Plaza in 2015, and the FNB Financial Center in 2024. At 545 feet (166 m), Tower at PNC Plaza, distinguished by its slanted roof, is the tallest building completed in Pittsburgh in the 21st century, while the FNB Financial Center is the tallest building in the Hill District.

The map below shows the location of buildings taller than 300 feet (91 m) in downtown Pittsburgh. Each marker is numbered by the building's height rank, and colored by the decade of its completion. There is only one building taller than 300 feet (91 m) located outside the map, the Cathedral of Learning in Oakland.

This list ranks completed and topped out Pittsburgh skyscrapers that stand at least 300 feet (91 m) tall, based on standard height measurements. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. The "Year" column indicates the year in which a building was completed.

The section with the jurisdiction timeline doesn't flow with the article.  It simply appears at the end.  I propose that we spin it off to its own, related article, with the following text.

Is the misspelling of "extremely" a typo or sic?--Thiseye 00:20, 12 June 2006 (UTC)[reply]

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, whose official "federal" spelling of its city name was "Pittsburg" from 1891 to 1911.

Is 1891 accurate?  Why is it not repeated in other articles?

Thank You.

what does the text "descended the Allegheny" mean? did they travel downstream until its terminus, or just travel along it? was it I'm not sure if I can make a suggestion for an alternative, which is why I ask here. also "by summer" to me suggests a gradual movement, not a single expedition Pudowski 00:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)[reply]

From my quick skim, there is a lot of helpful information here and it appears to be well-sourced.  Therefore, I gave it the highest rating without starting up any nomination processes (B-class). It looks like it is definitely on the way toward Good Article status, though you may wish to draw in more editors to provide a more diverse background of information.  It appears that the majority of edits to this article have come from a select few editors.  Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, of course.

I reviewed and passed History of Pittsburgh for GA Class.  This article is very through and has an accurate history of Pittsburgh from its beginnings through the present day with well cited sources.  It reads very well and is easy to find information within.  Only recommendations I give is to keep it up to date in the present day section as new events occur.

Updated Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania assessments to reflect new GA status. – Paschmitts 19:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)[reply]

As part of the WikiProject Good Articles, we're doing sweeps to go over all of the current GAs and see if they still meet the GA criteria. I'm specifically going over all of the "World History-Americas" articles. I believe the article currently meets the criteria and should remain listed as a Good article. I have made minor corrections throughout the article as well. Altogether the article is well-written and is still in great shape after its passing in April. Continue to improve the article making sure all new information is properly sourced and neutral. The last section about the current history of the city would benefit with more expansion. If you have any questions, let me know on my talk page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. I have updated the article history to reflect this review. --Nehrams2020 (talk) 02:13, 10 February 2008 (UTC)[reply]

Here's an article detailing some of the lesser known events in the city's history. Perhaps some can be incorporated into this article. [1]--TheZachMorrisExperience (talk) 04:47, 14 July 2008 (UTC)[reply]

Any thought of incorporating events from the 1936 flood into this article? There is already a Wikipedia article out there, so it shouldn't be too difficult... ClarkBHM (talk) 18:34, 20 October 2008 (UTC)[reply]

Wikipedia rules say the opening lede must sumamrize the article, and it now does a poor job. Two sentences on steel, ending in 1911?? Two more sentences to cover the last 100 years?? We need more and better. Rjensen (talk) 00:32, 7 March 2010 (UTC)[reply]

What is missing from the recently created city timeline article? Please add relevant content. Contributions welcome. Thank you. -- M2545 (talk) 11:07, 18 May 2015 (UTC)[reply]

Hello! This is a note to let the editors of this article know that File:Thaddeus M. Fowler - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 1902.jpg will be appearing as picture of the day on September 15, 2017. You can view and edit the POTD blurb at Template:POTD/2017-09-15. If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. — Chris Woodrich (talk) 03:32, 1 September 2017 (UTC)[reply]

I am concerned that this article no longer meets the good article criteria. Some of my concerns are listed below:

Is anyone interested in addressing these concerns, or should this go to WP:GAR? Z1720 (talk) 14:49, 19 December 2024 (UTC)[reply]

The following discussion is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion.

The article contains numerous uncited statements, including entire paragraphs. There is not much information post-2004, and the "Pittsburgh today" section needs to be rewritten due to MOS:CURRENT concerns. Z1720 (talk) 23:49, 26 December 2024 (UTC)[reply]

Carlow University is a private Catholic university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded in 1929 by the Sisters of Mercy.  The university's athletic teams are known as the Celtics, reflecting its Irish heritage. [1] As of 2017–2018, Carlow's student body was predominantly female, with women comprising 84% and men 16% of the student population.[2]

The Sisters of Mercy arrived in Pittsburgh on December 21, 1843. They traveled from County Carlow, Ireland to the Oakland area of Pittsburgh. They purchased 13 acres (5.3 ha) within the Diocese of Pittsburgh, and established a new motherhouse, as well as Our Lady of Mercy Academy.[3]

In 1929, the Sisters of Mercy opened Mount Mercy College, with the first commencement ceremony in 1933. Key campus buildings were constructed during the early years, including Aquinas Hall in 1936 and Trinity Hall in 1941. The college admitted men under the G.I. Bill in 1945, with Peter F. Flaherty, who went on to become a two-term Mayor of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County Commissioner,  among the first male students. [4]

In 1948, Antonian Hall opened, with office, classroom, and theater space. Thirteen years later, in 1961, Frances Warde Hall dormitory opened on campus. Prior to this, students lived in houses or halls in the surrounding area. Mount Mercy College's name was changed to Carlow College in 1969. A year later, Curran Hall was renovated to house the nursing school. In 1975, Carlow's mission statement was drafted. In 1978, Carlow College offered what few institutions of higher education did at the time: accelerated classes designed for working adults.[citation needed]

In 2004, Carlow College officially became Carlow University, and a year later appointed its first lay president, Mary Hines.[5]

In fall 2012, Carlow began competition in men's and women's cross country, the first male sport offered at Carlow.[6] Carlow announced on March 17, 2014, that it would field a men's basketball team for the 2014–2015 season.[7] In September 2015, Carlow announced it would add men's soccer and men's and women's golf teams beginning in Fall 2016.[8] In December 2016, Carlow announced that it would add men's and women's track and field teams beginning spring 2018.[9]

Carlow University is organized into two colleges (one for Arts and Sciences, one for Health and Wellness) across three campuses—Oakland, Cranberry, and Greensburg. The main campus in Oakland spans 13 acres and includes 14 buildings, such as Frances Warde Hall, named after one of the founding Sisters of Mercy, and the Palumbo Hall of Science and Technology.

The Sisters of Mercy Convent is a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark and motherhouse for nearly 150 Sisters of Mercy.

St. Agnes Church, dedicated in 1917, was designed by "nationally influential church-architect," John T. Comes. Masses are celebrated in the center on special occasions, such as the opening of a new academic year.

The university is a member of NCAA Division III, competing in the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference (AMCC) since the 2023-2024 academic year.[12] They are also a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA). Prior to the 2023-2024 academic year, the Celtics competed in the NAIA. They were affiliated with the American Mideast Conference from 2001–02 to 2011–12 (when the conference dissolved) and the River States Conference from 2012-2013 to 2022-2023.
